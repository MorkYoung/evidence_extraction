0	1968611	Proliferation of drug resistant tumour following chemotherapy is the principal cause of treatment failure in small cell lung cancer (small cell lung cancer).
0	1968611	Verapamil has been shown to partially restore drug sensitivity in tumour cells rendered resistant in vitro.
0	1968611	The results of the first large-scale randomised study of a resistance modifying drug given in conjunction with chemotherapy in cancer patients are reported.
0	1968611	Two hundred and twenty-six patients have been entered.
0	1968611	All patients received four cycles of cyclophosphamide (750 mg m-2), doxorubicin (40 mg m-2) and vincristine (1.4 mg m-2) on Day 1 and etoposide (75 mg m-2) on Days 1, 2 and 3, repeated at 21 day intervals.
0	1968611	Those patients randomised to the verapamil arm received oral verapamil 120 mg qid for 5 days with each course of chemotherapy.
0	1968611	Similar numbers of cycles of protocol treatment were given in both arms with over 75% of patients completing all four cycles.
0	1968611	There were no significant differences in general toxicities between the two arms, except for more severe alopecia in the verapamil treatment group (P = 0.045).
0	1968611	There was no significant difference in cardiovascular or haematological toxicity, although the median nadir white cell count after Cycle 1 chemotherapy was lower in the verapamil arm (P = 0.065) and there were significantly more dose reductions after Cycle 1 in the verapamil arm (P = 0.031).
0	1968611	No statistically significant differences in response (P = 0.582) or survival (P = 0.290) data were seen.
0	1968611	The absence of a significant improvement in response or survival using verapamil may relate to the low blood levels of verapamil seen in the clinic (0.8 microM), in contrast to those known to be maximally active in vitro (> 6 microM) or to the presence of other cellular mechanisms by which drug resistance develops.
0	3692032	Gait and balance disturbances typically emerge in advanced Parkinson’s disease with generally limited response to dopaminergic medication and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation.
0	3692032	Therefore, advanced programming with interleaved pulses was put forward to introduce concomittant nigral stimulation on caudal contacts of a subthalamic lead.
0	3692032	Here, we hypothesized that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata improves axial symptoms compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation.
0	3692032	Twelve patients were enrolled in this 2 × 2 cross-over double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial and both the safety and efficacy of combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation were evaluated compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation.
0	3692032	The primary outcome measure was the change of a broad-scaled cumulative axial Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale score (Scale II items 13–15, Scale III items 27–31) at ‘3-week follow-up’.
0	3692032	Secondary outcome measures specifically addressed freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
0	3692032	For the primary outcome measure no statistically significant improvement was observed for combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation at the ‘3-week follow-up’.
0	3692032	The secondary endpoints, however, revealed that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata might specifically improve freezing of gait, whereas balance impairment remained unchanged.
0	3692032	The combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata was safe, and of note, no clinically relevant neuropsychiatric adverse effect was observed.
0	3692032	Patients treated with subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation revealed no ‘global’ effect on axial motor domains.
0	3692032	However, this study opens the perspective that concomittant stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata possibly improves otherwise resistant freezing of gait and, therefore, highly warrants a subsequent phase III randomized controlled trial.
0	3600293	An increasing number of patients are suffering from stress-related symptoms and diagnoses.
0	3600293	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the medical yoga treatment in patients with stress-related symptoms and diagnoses in primary health care.
0	3600293	A randomized controlled study was performed at a primary health care centre in Sweden from March to June, 2011.
0	3600293	Patients were randomly allocated to a control group receiving standard care or a yoga group treated with medical yoga for 1 hour, once a week, over a 12-week period in addition to the standard care.
0	3600293	A total of 37 men and women, mean age of 53 ± 12 years were included.
0	3600293	General stress level (measured using Perceived Stress Scale (Perceived Stress Scale)), burnout (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale)), insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index (Insomnia Severity Index)), pain (visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS)), and overall health status (Euro Quality of Life EQ-VAS (EQ-VAS)) were measured before and after 12 weeks.
0	3600293	Patients assigned to the Yoga group showed significantly greater improvements on measures of general stress level (P < 0.000), anxiety (P < 0.019), and overall health status (P < 0.018) compared to controls.
0	3600293	Treatment with medical yoga is effective in reducing levels of stress and anxiety in patients with stress-related symptoms in primary health care.
0	3620921	Background A previous study indicated that a single application of 4% dimeticone liquid gel was effective in treating head louse infestation.
0	3620921	This study was designed to confirm this in comparison with two applications of 1% permethrin.  
0	3620921	Methods We have performed a single centre parallel group, randomised, controlled, open label, community based trial, with domiciliary visits, in Cambridgeshire, UK.
0	3620921	Treatments were allocated through sealed instructions derived from a computer generated list.
0	3620921	We enrolled 90 children and adults with confirmed head louse infestation analysed by intention to treat (80 per-protocol after 4 drop outs and 6 non-compliant).
0	3620921	The comparison was between 4% dimeticone liquid gel applied once for 15 minutes and 1% permethrin creme rinse applied for 10 minutes, repeated after 7 days as per manufacturer’s directions.
0	3620921	Evaluated by elimination of louse infestation after completion of treatment application regimen.  
0	3620921	Results Intention to treat comparison of a single dimeticone liquid gel treatment with two of permethrin gave success for 30/43 (69.8%) of the dimeticone liquid gel group and 7/47 (14.9%) of the permethrin creme rinse group (OR 13.19, 95% CI 4.69 to 37.07) (p < 0.001).
0	3620921	Per protocol results were similar with 27/35 (77.1%) success for dimeticone versus 7/45 (15.6%) for permethrin.
0	3620921	Analyses by household gave essentially similar outcomes.  
0	3620921	Conclusions The study showed one 15 minute application of 4% dimeticone liquid gel was superior to two applications of 1% permethrin creme rinse (p < 0.001).
0	3620921	The low efficacy of permethrin suggests it should be withdrawn.

0	3510714	Background Many people in Western countries do not follow public health physical activity (physical activity) recommendations.
0	3510714	Web-based interventions provide cost- and time-efficient means of delivering individually targeted lifestyle modification at a population level.  
0	3510714	Objective To examine whether access to a website with individually tailored feedback and suggestions on how to increase physical activity led to improved physical activity, anthropometrics, and health measurements.  
0	3510714	Methods Physically inactive adults (n = 12,287) participating in a nationwide eHealth survey and health examination in Denmark were randomly assigned to either an intervention (website) (n = 6055) or a no-intervention control group (n = 6232) in 2008.
0	3510714	The intervention website was founded on the theories of stages of change and of planned behavior and, apart from a forum page where a physiotherapist answered questions about physical activity and training, was fully automated.
0	3510714	After 3 and again after 6 months we emailed participants invitations to answer a Web-based follow-up questionnaire, which included the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
0	3510714	A subgroup of participants (n = 1190) were invited to a follow-up health examination at 3 months.  
0	3510714	Results Less than 22.0% (694/3156) of the participants logged on to the website once and only 7.0% (222/3159) logged on frequently.
0	3510714	We found no difference in physical activity level between the website and control groups at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
0	3510714	By dividing participants into three groups according to use of the intervention website, we found a significant difference in total and leisure-time physical activity in the website group.
0	3510714	The follow-up health examination showed no significant reductions in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and blood pressure, or improvements in arm strength and aerobic fitness in the website group.  
0	3510714	Conclusions Based on our findings, we suggest that active users of a Web-based physical activity intervention can improve their level of physical activity.
0	3510714	However, for unmotivated users, single-tailored feedback may be too brief.
0	3510714	Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated interventions with the potential to reach both motivated and unmotivated sedentary individuals.

0	4937081	Objective To evaluate the 104-week safety of dapagliflozin in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
0	4937081	Methods Pooled analysis assessing general safety (nine phase III studies ≤104 weeks) and cardiovascular safety (21 phase IIb/III studies ≤208 weeks) by age (<65; ≥65; ≥75 years).
0	4937081	Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (±background glucose-lowering therapy) received: dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 2026) vs. placebo (n = 1956) (nine-study pool); or dapagliflozin (2.5–50 mg; n = 5936) vs. control (placebo/comparator) (n = 3403) (21-study pool).  
0	4937081	Results Adverse events (Adverse events) and discontinuations owing to Adverse events were more common in older vs. younger patients, and were more frequent with dapagliflozin than placebo (Adverse events: <65 years: 73.1 vs. 70.7 %; ≥65 years: 77.4 vs. 73.1 %; ≥75 years: 80.4 vs. 75.3 %, respectively; discontinuations: <65 years: 5.9 vs. 5.0 %; ≥65 years: 14.4 vs. 12.2 %; ≥75 years: 26.8 vs. 22.1 %, respectively); serious AE (serious AE) frequency was similar (<65 years: 11.0 vs. 11.8 %; ≥65 years: 20.0 vs. 20.2 %; ≥75 years: 19.6 vs. 18.2 %, respectively).
0	4937081	Hypoglycaemia frequency was similar across age groups and was higher with dapagliflozin than placebo (<65 years: 18.0 vs. 13.4 %; ≥65 years: 20.2 vs. 17.7 %; ≥75 years: 17.5 vs. 16.9 %, respectively); major episodes were rare.
0	4937081	Urinary tract infection frequency was similar between treatment groups in older patients, with no increase vs. younger patients (<65 years: 8.8 vs. 5.5 %; ≥65 years: 8.1 vs. 7.6 %; ≥75 years: 8.2 vs. 9.1 %, respectively); urinary tract infection serious AEs were rare.
0	4937081	Genital infection Adverse events were more common with dapagliflozin, with no increase in older patients (<65 years: 8.2 vs. 1.0 %; ≥65 years: 6.6 vs. 0.9 %; ≥75 years: 7.2 vs. 0.0 %, respectively) and no serious AEs.
0	4937081	Volume reduction Adverse events were uncommon, with a higher frequency with dapagliflozin vs. placebo and in patients ≥75 years (<65 years: 1.7 vs. 1.2 %; ≥65 years: 2.3 vs. 1.7 %; ≥75 years: 3.1 vs. 2.6 %, respectively).
0	4937081	Dapagliflozin did not increase the risk of fractures (<65 years: 1.1 vs. 1.1 %; ≥65 years: 1.1 vs. 2.7 %; ≥75 years: 1.0 vs. 2.6 %, respectively) or falls (<65 years: 0.7 vs. 0.7 %; ≥65 years: 0.6 vs. 2.1 %; ≥75 years: 0.0 vs. 1.3 %, respectively), regardless of age.
0	4937081	Adverse events of renal function were more common with dapagliflozin than placebo and increased with age (<65 years: 3.5 vs. 2.3 %; ≥65 years: 14.0 vs. 7.9 %; ≥75 years: 29.9 vs. 20.8 %, respectively).
0	4937081	Most were non-serious small transient increases in serum creatinine.
0	4937081	Dapagliflozin did not increase cardiovascular risk regardless of age [hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) vs. control: <65 years: 0.726 (0.473, 1.114); ≥65 years: 0.879 (0.565, 1.366); ≥75 years: 0.950 (0.345, 2.617), respectively].  
0	4937081	Conclusion Dapagliflozin treatment up to 104 weeks was well tolerated in older patients.

0	5812853	Background/Objective The heart rate (heart rate) and metabolic (VO2) responses to treadmill running using the GlideTrak™ body weight support system have not been reported.
0	5812853	The purpose of this study was to compare the submaximal and maximal heart rate and VO2 responses to normal-weight treadmill running (treadmill running) to treadmill running with body weight support provided by the GlideTrak™ (GlideTrak™).  
0	5812853	Methods Twenty participants (11 males; 9 females) 18 to 26 years of age voluntarily participated in this study.
0	5812853	Each participant completed two exercise tests in each mode of running: a maximal graded exercise test to compare maximal heart rate and VO2 values and a submaximal exercise test to compare the HR-VO2 relationship.  
0	5812853	Results Maximal heart rate and VO2 values were significantly (p < 0.001) lower during GlideTrak™ (183.4 ± 9.1 bpm, 38.1 ± 7.2 mL kg−1 min−1) compared to treadmill running (194.3 ± 8.6 bpm, 49.5 ± 8.9 kg−1 min−1).
0	5812853	There was a significant difference in the HR-VO2 relationship between GlideTrak™ and treadmill running.
0	5812853	Compared to treadmill running, exercising at a heart rate of 140 bpm resulted in a VO2 that was 4.0 mL kg−1 min−1 lower during GlideTrak™.
0	5812853	At the VO2 associated with a heart rate of 140 bpm during treadmill running, the heart rate during GlideTrak™ was 16 bpm higher.
0	5812853	During GlideTrak™ at intensities of exercise up to an RER of 1.0, only 8 participants achieved vigorous intensities of aerobic exercise defined as 64-90% of VO2max.  
0	5812853	Conclusion Exercising with the GlideTrak™ body weight support system may not provide the same cardiorespiratory training stimulus as normal-weight treadmill running.
0	2699711	OBJECTIVE To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis).  
0	2699711	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with diabetic ketoacidosis to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.
0	2699711	After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34).
0	2699711	Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).  
0	2699711	RESULTS There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin.
0	2699711	After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dl).
0	2699711	Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).  
0	2699711	CONCLUSIONS Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
0	2699711	A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin.
0	2699711	Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.
0	5879083	Objective To investigate the effects of a school-based once-a-week sports program on physical fitness, physical activity, and cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents with a physical disability.  
0	5879083	Methods This controlled clinical trial included 71 children and adolescents from four schools for special education [mean age 13.7 (2.9) years, range 8–19, 55% boys].
0	5879083	Participants had various chronic health conditions including cerebral palsy (37%), other neuromuscular (44%), metabolic (8%), musculoskeletal (7%), and cardiovascular (4%) disorders.
0	5879083	Before recruitment and based on the presence of school-based sports, schools were assigned as sport or control group.
0	5879083	School-based sports were initiated and provided by motivated experienced physical educators.
0	5879083	The sport group (n = 31) participated in a once-a-week school-based sports program for 6 months, which included team sports.
0	5879083	The control group (n = 40) followed the regular curriculum.
0	5879083	Anaerobic performance was assessed by the Muscle Power Sprint Test.
0	5879083	Secondary outcome measures included aerobic performance, VO2 peak, strength, physical activity, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, body composition, and the metabolic profile.  
0	5879083	Results A significant improvement of 16% in favor of the sport group was found for anaerobic performance (p = 0.003).
0	5879083	In addition, the sport group lost 2.8% more fat mass compared to the control group (p = 0.007).
0	5879083	No changes were found for aerobic performance, VO2 peak, physical activity, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and the metabolic profile.  
0	5879083	Conclusion Anaerobic performance and fat mass improved following a school-based sports program.
0	5879083	These effects are promising for long-term fitness and health promotion, because sports sessions at school eliminate certain barriers for sports participation and adding a once-a-week sports session showed already positive effects for 6 months.  
0	5879083	Clinical Trial Registration This trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR4698).
0	5094573	Background Patients with COPD present a major recruitment of the inspiratory muscles, predisposing to chest incoordination, increasing the degree of dyspnea and impairing their exercise capacity.
0	5094573	Stretching techniques could decrease the respiratory muscle activity and improve their contractile capacity; however, the systemic effects of stretching remain unknown.  
0	5094573	Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic training combined with respiratory muscle stretching on functional exercise capacity and thoracoabdominal kinematics in patients with COPD.  
0	5094573	Design This study was a randomized and controlled trial.  
0	5094573	Participants A total of 30 patients were allocated to a treatment group (treatment group) or a control group (control group; n=15, each group).  
0	5094573	Intervention The treatment group was engaged in respiratory muscle stretching and the control group in upper and lower limb muscle stretching.
0	5094573	Both groups performed 24 sessions (twice a week, 12 weeks) of aerobic training.  
0	5094573	Evaluations Functional exercise capacity (6-minute walk test), thoracoabdominal kinematics (optoelectronic plethysmography), and respiratory muscle activity (surface electromyography) were evaluated during exercise.
0	5094573	Analysis of covariance was used to compare the groups at a significance level of 5%.  
0	5094573	Results After the intervention, the treatment group showed improved abdominal (abdominal) contribution, compartmental volume, mobility, and functional exercise capacity with decreased dyspnea when compared with the control group (P<0.01).
0	5094573	The treatment group also showed a decreased respiratory muscle effort required to obtain the same pulmonary volume compared to the control group (P<0.001).  
0	5094573	Conclusion Our results suggest that aerobic training combined with respiratory muscle stretching increases the functional exercise capacity with decreased dyspnea in patients with COPD.
0	5094573	These effects are associated with an increased efficacy of the respiratory muscles and participation of the abdominal compartment.
0	3675645	Aims The aim of this single-site, randomized, controlled, double-blind, 3-arm parallel study was to determine the effectiveness of a prophylaxis paste containing 15% calcium sodium phosphosilicate (calcium sodium phosphosilicate; NovaMin®) with and without fluoride in reducing dentine hypersensitivity immediately after a single application and 28 days following dental scaling and root planing.  
0	3675645	Materials & Methods Overall, 151 subjects were enrolled in this study.
0	3675645	All subjects received a scaling and root planing procedure followed by a final prophylaxis step using one of three different prophylaxis pastes: Test-A (15% NovaMin® and NaF), Test-B (15% NovaMin®) and a control.
0	3675645	Dentine hypersensitivity was assessed by tactile stimulus (Yeaple Probe®) and by air blast (Schiff scale) at baseline, immediately after and 28 days after a prophylaxis procedure.
0	3675645	One hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the study.  
0	3675645	Results Subjects having received the test prophylaxis pastes showed statistically lower (anova, p < 0.05) dentine hypersensitivity compared with the control group immediately after the prophylaxis procedure (Yeaple Probe®: Test-A = 20.9 ± 12.6, Test-B = 22.7 ± 12.9, Control=11.2 ± 3.1; Schiff score: Test-A = 1.1 ± 0.6, Test-B = 1.1 ± 0.6, Control = 2.0 ± 0.7) and after 28 days (Yeaple probe: Test-A = 21.5 ± 11.9, Test-B = 20.6 ± 11.3, Control = 11.8 ± 6.0; Schiff score: Test-A = 1.0 ± 0.6, Test-B = 1.0 ± 0.6, Control = 2.0 ± 0.7).  
0	3675645	Conclusions In conclusion, the single application of both fluoridated and non-fluoridated prophylaxis pastes containing 15% calcium sodium phosphosilicate (NovaMin®) provided a significant reduction of dentine hypersensitivity up to at least 28 days.
0	5496184	Background Of the more than 1.1 million men diagnosed worldwide annually with prostate cancer, the majority have indolent tumors.
0	5496184	Distinguishing between aggressive and indolent cancer is an important clinical challenge.
0	5496184	The current approaches for assessing tumor aggressiveness are recognized as insufficient.
0	5496184	A validated protein-based assay has been shown to predict tumor aggressiveness from prostate biopsy.
0	5496184	The main objective of this study was to measure the clinical utility of this new assay in the management of early-stage prostate cancer.  
0	5496184	Methods One hundred twenty nine board-certified urologists were asked to participate in a randomized, two-arm experiment.
0	5496184	We collected data over 2 rounds using simulated clinical cases administered via an online platform.
0	5496184	The cases were all newly diagnosed Gleason 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 prostate camcer patients.
0	5496184	Urologists in the intervention arm received a 15-min webinar on this protein-based assay and given assay test results for their simulated patients in round 2.
0	5496184	Each case had a preferred recommendation of either active surveillance or active treatment.
0	5496184	The measured outcome was rate of preferred recommendation, defined as urologists who recommended the proper treatment course.
0	5496184	Analyses were done using difference-in-difference estimations.  
0	5496184	Results Using multinomial logistical regression, urologists who were given the assay results were significantly more likely to choose the preferred recommendation (active surveillance or active treatment) compared to controls (p = 0.004).
0	5496184	These urologists were also significantly more likely to involve their patients in the treatment decision compared to controls (p = 0.001).  
0	5496184	Conclusions By providing additional information to inform the physician’s treatment plan, a protein-based assay shows demonstrable clinical utility confirmed through a rigorous randomized controlled study design and regression analyses to test for effects.
0	5426597	Background To determine the safety and clinical efficacy of an innovative integrated airway system (AnapnoGuard™ 100 system) that continuously monitors and controls the cuff pressure (Pcuff), while facilitating the aspiration of subglottic secretions (subglottic secretions).  
0	5426597	Methods This was a prospective, single centre, open-label, randomized, controlled feasibility and safety trial.
0	5426597	The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of device related adverse events (adverse events) and serious adverse events (serious AE) as a result of using AnapnoGuard (AnapnoGuard) 100 during mechanical ventilation.
0	5426597	Secondary endpoints were: (1) mechanical complications rate (2) ICU staff satisfaction; (3) VAP occurrence; (4) length of mechanical ventilation; (5) length of Intensive Care Unit stay and mortality; (6) volume of evacuated subglottic secretions.
0	5426597	Sixty patients were randomized to be intubated with the AnapnoGuard endotracheal-tube (endotracheal-tube) and connected to the AnapnoGuard 100 system allowing Pcuff adjustment and subglottic secretions aspiration; or with an endotracheal-tube combined with subglottic secretions drainage and Pcuff controlled manually.  
0	5426597	Results No difference in adverse events rate was identified between the groups.
0	5426597	The use of AnapnoGuard system was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Pcuff determinations in the safety range (97.3% vs. 71%; p<0.01) and a trend to a greater volume of aspirated subglottic secretions secretions: (192.0[64–413] ml vs. 150[50–200], p = 0.19 (total)); (57.8[20–88.7] ml vs. 50[18.7–62] ml, p = 0.11 (daily)).
0	5426597	No inter-group difference was detected using AnapnoGuard system vs. controls in terms of post-extubation throat pain level (0 [0–2] vs. 0 [0–3]; p = 0.7), hoarseness (42.9% vs. 75%; p = 0.55) and tracheal mucosa oedema (16.7% vs. 10%; p = 0.65).
0	5426597	Patients enrolled in the AnapnoGuard group had a trend to reduced VAP risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia(VAP) (14.8% vs. 40%; p = 0.06), which were more frequently monomicrobial (25% vs. 70%; p = 0.03).
0	5426597	No statistically significant difference was observed in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and mortality.  
0	5426597	Conclusions 
0	5426597	The use AnapnoGuard 100 system and AnapnoGuard tube in critically ill intubated patients is safe and effective in Pcuff control and subglottic secretions drainage.
0	5426597	Its protective role against VAP needs to be confirmed in a larger randomized trial.

0	4312941	Aims The PDY6797 study evaluated efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamics of lixisenatide in Japanese and Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus) insufficiently controlled with sulphonylureas with/without metformin.  
0	4312941	Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprised a single-dose assessment of lixisenatide 5 and 10 µg, and a 5- to 6-week repeated dose-escalation assessment of lixisenatide 5 to 30 µg once (QD) or twice daily (BID).
0	4312941	The primary endpoint was change in postprandial plasma glucose (postprandial plasma glucose) area under the curve (AUC)[0:29–4:30 h] after a standardized breakfast at the highest tolerated lixisenatide dose.
0	4312941	Change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 2-h postprandial plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose) were assessed, as were adverse events.  
0	4312941	Results Change from baseline in postprandial plasma glucose AUC[0:29–4:30 h] with lixisenatide QD and BID was significantly greater than placebo (p < 0.0001 for all study populations), with particularly prominent effects in Japanese patients.
0	4312941	Greater reductions in postprandial plasma glucose AUC[0:29–4:30 h] were seen with lixisenatide QD versus BID, while the totality of evidence suggested that the lixisenatide 20 µg dose was optimal.
0	4312941	In the overall population, changes from baseline for 2-h postprandial plasma glucose, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were significant with lixisenatide QD and BID versus placebo (p < 0.01 for all).
0	4312941	Lixisenatide was well tolerated.  
0	4312941	Conclusions Lixisenatide significantly reduced postprandial plasma glucose AUC[0:29–4:30 h] versus placebo at the highest well-tolerated dose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with sulphonylureas with/without metformin and had a good safety and tolerability profile.
0	4312941	Japanese patients experienced particular benefits with lixisenatide in terms of reductions in postprandial plasma glucose excursions.
0	5862462	Purpose Strength training improves distance running economy and performance.
0	5862462	This finding is based predominantly on maximal and explosive strength programmes applied to locomotor muscles, particularly on the lower limbs.
0	5862462	It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic cost (Cmet) and an improvement in running performance is feasible with strength training of the postural and trunk muscles.  
0	5862462	Methods Using kinematic, neuromuscular and metabolic measurements of running at two different speeds before and after a 12-week Pilates training programme, we tested the hypothesis that core training might improve the running Cmet and performance of trained runners.
0	5862462	Thirty-two individuals were randomly assigned to the control group (control group, n = 16) or the Pilates group (Pilates group, n = 16).  
0	5862462	Results Confirming our hypothesis, a significant improvement (p<0.05) was observed for running performance in the Pilates group (pre: 25.65±0.4 min; post: 23.23±0.4 min) compared to the control group (pre: 25.33±0.58 min; post: 24.61±0.52 min).
0	5862462	Similarly, the Pilates group (4.33±0.07 J.kg-1.m-1) had better responses than the control group (4.71±0.11 J.kg-1.m-1) during post-training for Cmet.
0	5862462	These findings were accompanied by decreased electromyographic activity of the postural muscles at submaximal running intensities in the Pilates group.  
0	5862462	Conclusions Overall, these results provide a rationale for selecting strength training strategies that target adaptations on specific postural and locomotor muscles for trained distance runners.
0	5820089	Objectives This study examined the effect of flipped learning in comparison to traditional learning in a surgical nursing practicum.  
0	5820089	Methods The subjects of this study were 102 nursing students in their third year of university who were scheduled to complete a clinical nursing practicum in an operating room or surgical unit.
0	5820089	Participants were randomly assigned to either a flipped learning group (n = 51) or a traditional learning group (n = 51) for the 1-week, 45-hour clinical nursing practicum.
0	5820089	The flipped-learning group completed independent e-learning lessons on surgical nursing and received a brief orientation prior to the commencement of the practicum, while the traditional-learning group received a face-to-face orientation and on-site instruction.
0	5820089	After the completion of the practicum, both groups completed a case study and a conference.
0	5820089	The student's self-efficacy, self-leadership, and problem-solving skills in clinical practice were measured both before and after the one-week surgical nursing practicum.  
0	5820089	Results Participants' independent goal setting and evaluation of beliefs and assumptions for the subscales of self-leadership and problem-solving skills were compared for the flipped learning group and the traditional learning group.
0	5820089	The results showed greater improvement on these indicators for the flipped learning group in comparison to the traditional learning group.  
0	5820089	Conclusions The flipped learning method might offer more effective e-learning opportunities in terms of self-leadership and problem-solving than the traditional learning method in surgical nursing practicums.
0	3665829	Background This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the cyber bullying prevention WebQuest course implementation.  
0	3665829	Methodology/Findings The study adopted the quasi-experimental design with two classes made up of a total of 61 junior high school students of seventh grade.
0	3665829	The study subjects comprised of 30 students from the experimental group and 31 students from the control group.
0	3665829	The experimental group received eight sessions (total 360 minutes) of the teaching intervention for four consecutive weeks, while the control group did not engage in any related courses.
0	3665829	The self-compiled questionnaire for the student’s knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward cyber bullying prevention was adopted.
0	3665829	Data were analysed through generalized estimating equations to understand the immediate results on the student’s knowledge, attitudes, and intentions after the intervention.
0	3665829	The results show that the WebQuest course immediately and effectively enhanced the knowledge of cyber bullying, reduced the intentions, and retained the effects after the learning.
0	3665829	But it produced no significant impact on the attitude toward cyber bullying.  
0	3665829	Conclusions/Significance The intervention through this pilot study was effective and positive for cyber bulling prevention.
0	3665829	It was with small number of students.
0	3665829	Therefore, studies with large number of students and long experimental times, in different areas and countries are warranted.
0	65045	Background The effectiveness of teaching critical appraisal to students of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) has not been studied.
0	65045	In this study we attempt to determine if a workshop for final year students at a naturopathic college improved their ability to utilize critical appraisal concepts.  
0	65045	Methods We assigned 83 Naturopathic Interns to two groups: Group A (n = 47) or Group B (n = 36).
0	65045	We conducted a baseline assessment of all subjects' critical appraisal skills.
0	65045	Group A was assigned to receive a 3 ½ hour workshop on Evidence
0	65045	Based  Medicine (Evidence Based Medicine) and Group B received a workshop on bioethics (control intervention).
0	65045	The groups critical appraisal skills were re-evaluated at this time.
0	65045	We then crossed over the intervention so that Group B received the Evidence
0	65045	Based Medicine workshop while Group A received the bioethics workshop.
0	65045	Assessment of critical appraisal skills of the two groups was again performed.  
0	65045	Results The students mean scores were similar in Group A (14.8) and Group B (15.0) after Group A had received the intervention and Group B had received the control (p = 0.75).
0	65045	Group scores were not significantly improved at the end of the trial compared to at the beginning of the study (Group A: 15.1 to 16.1) (Group B 15.6 to 15.9).
0	65045	Student's confidence in reading research papers also did not improve throughout the course of the study.  
0	65045	Conclusion The final year is a difficult but important time to teach critical appraisal and evidence skills.
0	65045	Single, short intervention programs will likely yield negligible results.
0	65045	A multi-factorial approach may be better suited to implementing EBCAM than single short interventions.
0	4717600	Background We have previously shown that a combination of glucosyl hesperidin (G-hesperidin) plus caffeine reduces accumulation of body fat, whereas G-hesperidin or caffeine alone shows little effect on high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice.
0	4717600	The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of G-hesperidin plus caffeine on body fat and serum TG in healthy subjects with moderately high body mass index (body mass index) and serum TG.
0	4717600	Since we considered that there are individual differences in caffeine sensitivity, we conducted dose-finding study of caffeine combined with G-hesperidin.  
0	4717600	Methods Seventy-five healthy subjects with moderately high body mass index (24–30 kg/m2) and serum TG (100–250 mg/dl) were divided and assigned to 12-week intervention with daily intakes of 500 mg of G-hesperidin with or without 25, 50, or 75 mg of caffeine, or placebo in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design .  
0	4717600	Results After intervention, decreases in abdominal fat area (abdominal fat area), especially subcutaneous fat area (subcutaneous fat area), were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 50-mg caffeine group (AFA:-8.4 ± 21.9 v.s. 16.3 ± 34.1 cm2; p < 0.05, subcutaneous fat area: -9.3 ± 17.1 v.s. 11.2 ± 18.3 cm2; p < 0.01) and in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group (AFA:-17.0 ± 31.4 v.s. 16.3 ± 34.1 cm2; p < 0.01, subcutaneous fat area: -12.4 ± 18.7 v.s. 11.2 ± 18.3 cm2; p < 0.01) than in the placebo group.
0	4717600	Fat-decreasing effects of G-hesperidin were enhanced dose-dependently by caffeine addition.
0	4717600	body mass index decreases were significantly greater in the G-hesperidin with 75-mg caffeine group than in the placebo group (-0.56 ± 0.74 v.s. -0.02 ± 0.58 kg/m2; p < 0.05).
0	4717600	G-hesperidin with/without caffeine had no effect on serum TG (p > 0.05 v.s. placebo).  
0	4717600	Conclusions These data suggested that a combination of 500-mg G-hesperidin with 50- or 75-mg caffeine may be useful for the prevention or treatment of obesity.

0	3702149	Background: The worldwide nursing shortage is threatening the quality of healthcare.
0	3702149	The two most common causes in maintaining nurses are job satisfaction, a positive working environment, and good relationships among staff.
0	3702149	This study aimed to determine the effect of interpersonal communication skills training on job satisfaction among the nurses working in Al-Zahra Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, in 2011.  
0	3702149	Materials and Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental research with two groups and two phases, and was carried out on 70 nurses from Al-Zahra University Hospital.
0	3702149	Only nurses who had been employed for more than one year were accepted into the study.
0	3702149	There were 35 nurses in the test group and 35 nurses in the control group.
0	3702149	The study questionnaire included personal details and job satisfaction scale by Smith and Kendall.
0	3702149	Sampling was done randomly and nurses were divided into test and control groups.
0	3702149	In the test group, the communication skills training program was done in 6 sessions, twice a week and each session was held for 2 hours.
0	3702149	The questionnaire was completed in two stages; before, and two months after the study.
0	3702149	Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics through SPSS Software version 18.  
0	3702149	Findings: Findings showed that pre-intervention mean score of job satisfaction of nurses in both groups had no significant difference (p = 0.92).
0	3702149	After the communication skills training program in the experimental group, mean score of job satisfaction increased and it was significant compared to the control group (p < 0.01).  
0	3702149	Conclusions: The data analysis showed that the interpersonal communication skills training program increased the mean score of job satisfaction in the test group.
0	3702149	Therefore, it seems necessary that nursing managers design training programs for them.
0	4973800	Background Is the timing of dosing for amlodipine and atorvastatin important with regard to therapeutic efficacy?
0	4973800	To answer this question, we designed an outpatient, practice-based, case-control study lasting 8 weeks.  
0	4973800	Material/Methods Two hundred patients were divided into 2 groups: in Group I, patients were provided with a single pill containing amlodipine/atorvastatin (5/20 mg) to be taken each night at 10 pm, and in Group II, patients were taking amlodipine (5 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) each morning at 7 am.  
0	4973800	Results Our results indicated no obvious difference in blood pressure control between the 2 groups.
0	4973800	Taking amlodipine at night not only lowered blood pressure, but it also provided better control during the peak blood pressure in the morning.
0	4973800	Hypercholesterolemia control in the 2 groups was also not significantly different, taking atorvastatin in the morning was as effective as dosing at night in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
0	4973800	While the carotid IMT, hs-CRP, and LVMI were significantly lower after treatment, no differences were found between the 2 groups.
0	4973800	Although no obvious difference was found in adverse drug reactions between the 2 groups, compliance was much better in the single-pill group than in patients taking the 2 medications separately.  
0	4973800	Conclusions In conclusion, single-pill amlodipine-atorvastatin taken at night can lower blood pressure and reduce the morning peak blood pressure levels the next day.
0	4973800	Additionally, this dosing method could improve patient adherence to the therapy.
0	5755681	This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study assessed the effect of umeclidinium/vilanterol (umeclidinium/vilanterol) on exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) using the endurance shuttle walk test (endurance shuttle walk test).
0	5755681	Patients were randomised 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences: 1) umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 µg followed by placebo or 2) placebo followed by umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 µg.
0	5755681	Each treatment was taken once daily for 12 weeks.
0	5755681	The primary end-point was 3-h post-dose exercise endurance time (exercise endurance time) at week 12.
0	5755681	Secondary end-points included trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) and 3-h post-dose functional residual capacity (functional residual capacity), both at week 12.
0	5755681	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Assessment Test (COPD Assessment Test) score at week 12 was also assessed.
0	5755681	umeclidinium/vilanterol treatment did not result in a statistically significant improvement in exercise endurance time change from baseline at week 12 versus placebo (p=0.790).
0	5755681	However, improvements were observed in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (206 mL, 95% CI 167–246), 3-h post-dose functional residual capacity (−346 mL, 95% CI −487 to −204) and COPD Assessment Test score (−1.07 units, 95% CI −2.09 to −0.05) versus placebo at week 12.
0	5755681	umeclidinium/vilanterol did not result in improvements in exercise endurance time at week 12 versus placebo, despite improvements in measures of lung function, hyperinflation and health status.
0	3487977	Background Even with an adequate pain assessment, critically ill patients under sedation experience pain during procedures in the intensive care unit (intensive care unit).
0	3487977	We evaluated the effects of adjunctive administration of Remifentanil, a short-acting drug, in deeply sedated patient on variation of Bispectral Index (Bispectral Index) during a fiberoptic bronchoscopy.  
0	3487977	Methods A prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 18-bed intensive care unit.
0	3487977	Patients needing a tracheal fibroscopy under deep sedation (midazolam (0.1 mg/kg per hour) fentanyl (4 μg/kg per hour)) and neuromuscular blocking (atracurium 0.5 mg/kg) were included in the study.
0	3487977	A continuous monitoring of Bispectral Index, arterial pressure, and heart rate were realized before, during, and after the fiberoptic exam.
0	3487977	An adjunctive continuous placebo or Remifentanil infusion was started just before the fiberoptic exam with a target effect-site concentration of 4 ng/ml using a Base Primea pump.  
0	3487977	Results Mean arterial pressure and heart rates were comparable between the placebo and Remifentanil groups at all times of the procedure.
0	3487977	We did not observe differences in the variation of Bispectral Index values between the two groups during procedure.
0	3487977	We described no change in Bispectral Index values relative to the placebo group in this population.  
0	3487977	Conclusions In deeply sedated and paralyzed patients, receiving analgesic support based on a scale score an additional administration of short-acting analgesic drug, such as Remifentanil, seems not to be necessary for acute pain control.

0	1636653	Background Previous studies showed that anodal transcranial DC stimulation (transcranial DC stimulation) applied to the primary motor cortex of the affected hemisphere (M1affected hemisphere) after subcortical stroke transiently improves performance of complex tasks that mimic activities of daily living (activities of daily living).
0	1636653	It is not known if relatively simpler motor tasks are similarly affected.
0	1636653	Here we tested the effects of transcranial DC stimulation on pinch force (pinch force) and simple reaction time (reaction time) tasks in patients with chronic stroke in a double-blind cross-over Sham-controlled experimental design.  
0	1636653	Results Anodal transcranial DC stimulation shortened reaction times and improved pinch force in the paretic hand relative to Sham stimulation, an effect present in patients with higher impairment.  
0	1636653	Conclusion transcranial DC stimulation of M1affected hemisphere can modulate performance of motor tasks simpler than those previously studied, a finding that could potentially benefit patients with relatively higher impairment levels.
0	5791464	Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of tamsulosin and tadalafil as medical expulsive therapy for distal ureteric stones.  
0	5791464	Patients and Methods: This was a prospective study performed between December 2014 and February 2016.
0	5791464	A total of 123 adult patients (>18 years of age) presenting with distal ureteric stones sized 6–10 mm were randomized to treatment with tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily (Group A) or tadalafil10 mg once daily (Group B).
0	5791464	Therapy was given for a maximum of 4 weeks.
0	5791464	The stone expulsion rate was the primary endpoint.
0	5791464	Time to stone expulsion, number of colic episodes, analgesic use, number of hospital visits for pain, endoscopic treatment, and adverse effects of the drugs were noted.
0	5791464	Statistical analyses were done using Fisher's exact test and Chi-square test.  
0	5791464	Results: A total of 61 patients were included in tamsulosin group and 62 patients in tadalafil group.
0	5791464	A statistically insignificant difference was found for stone clearance rate between both groups as a whole (Group A-73.77%, Group B-69.35%, P = 0.690) as well as when we considered both subgroups (A1-78.05%, B1-75.0%, P = 0.802; A2-65.0%, B2-55.6%, P = 0.741).
0	5791464	All the primary and secondary outcome measures were more in favour of stones ≤8 mm size than stones >8 mm size.
0	5791464	No statistical difference was found for adverse drug effects except for retrograde ejaculation, which was significantly high in tamsulosin group (P < 0.001).  
0	5791464	Conclusion: This study showed that although tamsulosin is more effective for stone clearance than tadalafil, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.690).
0	5789503	Objectives: The study aimed to test the effect of intraoperative intravenous (intravenous) lidocaine on the incidence of postextubation laryngospasm in adult patients.  
0	5789503	Methods: The prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, between January and December 2012.
0	5789503	Seventy-two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 36) or intravenous lidocaine (n = 36), 1 mg/kg bolus after desflurane was discontinued.
0	5789503	Laryngospasm was graded from 0 to 3 based on the absence or presence of signs and the severity of postextubation laryngospasm.  
0	5789503	Results: The study was terminated early by the data monitoring committee because of safety concerns due to an increased incidence of postextubation laryngospasm.
0	5789503	Patient demographics were similar for both groups.
0	5789503	The incidence of postextubation laryngospasm was 19.5% in the placebo group and 0% in the treatment (lidocaine) group; this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.017; 95% confidence interval, 4.6% to 36.0%).  
0	5789503	Conclusions: The cause of laryngospasm in our study was most likely the rapid increase in the concentration of inspired desflurane, which might have caused airway irritation.
0	5789503	Therefore, we believe that pretreating patients at risk of developing laryngospasm with intravenous lidocaine could be effective.
0	3702243	Objective To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and quality of life of 5 mg mifepristone per day compared with a placebo in treating uterine fibroids.  
0	3702243	Design Randomized, double-blind clinical study.  
0	3702243	Location Eusebio Hernández Gynecology and Obstetrics Teaching Hospital, Havana, Cuba.  
0	3702243	Subjects One hundred twenty-four subjects with symptomatic uterine fibroids.  
0	3702243	Treatment One daily capsule of 5 mg mifepristone or a mifepristone placebo over 3 months.  
0	3702243	Variables in evaluating safety Changes in fibroid and uterine volumes, changes in symptom prevalence and intensity, and changes in quality of life.

0	3702243	There were significant differences between the groups with respect to pelvic pain prevalence (P = 0.006), pelvic pressure (P = 0.027), rectal pain (P = 0.013), hypermenorrhea (P < 0.001), and metrorrhagia (P = 0.002) at the end of treatment.
0	3702243	Amenorrhea was 93.1% and 4.3% in the mifepristone and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.001).
0	3702243	Treatment side effects were significantly greater in the mifepristone group.
0	3702243	Estradiol levels did not differ significantly between the placebo and mifepristone groups at the end of treatment.
0	3702243	Improvement in quality of life was significantly greater in the categories of “symptoms” (P = 0.004) and “activity” (P = 0.045) in the mifepristone group.  
0	3702243	Conclusion The 5 mg dosage of mifepristone presented significantly superior efficacy compared to the placebo.
0	3714483	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of two bariatric procedures versus intensive medical therapy (intensive medical therapy) on β-cell function and body composition.  
0	3714483	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 60 subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 9.7 ± 1%) and moderate obesity (BMI 36 ± 2 kg/m2) randomized to intensive medical therapy alone, intensive medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or intensive medical therapy plus sleeve gastrectomy.
0	3714483	Assessment of β-cell function (mixed-meal tolerance testing) and body composition was performed at baseline and 12 and 24 months.  
0	3714483	RESULTS Glycemic control improved in all three groups at 24 months (N = 54), with a mean HbA1c of 6.7 ± 1.2% for gastric bypass, 7.1 ± 0.8% for sleeve gastrectomy, and 8.4 ± 2.3% for intensive medical therapy (P < 0.05 for each surgical group versus intensive medical therapy).
0	3714483	Reduction in body fat was similar for both surgery groups, with greater absolute reduction in truncal fat in gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy (−16 vs. −10%; P = 0.04).
0	3714483	Insulin sensitivity increased significantly from baseline in gastric bypass (2.7-fold; P = 0.004) and did not change in sleeve gastrectomy or intensive medical therapy.
0	3714483	β-Cell function (oral disposition index) increased 5.8-fold in gastric bypass from baseline, was markedly greater than intensive medical therapy (P = 0.001), and was not different between sleeve gastrectomy versus intensive medical therapy (P = 0.30).

0	2852713	Background/Aims The ability to visualize the small bowel mucosa by capsule endoscopy is limited.
0	2852713	Moreover, studies involving small-bowel preparation with purgative drugs have failed to establish which preparations produce better images and higher diagnostic yields.
0	2852713	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacies and diagnostic yields of different bowel preparations.  
0	2852713	Methods A cohort of 134 patients with suspected small bowel disease was randomly assigned to 3 groups.
0	2852713	Patients in group A (n=44) fasted for 12 h before being administered an M2A capsule (Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel).
0	2852713	Patients in group B (n=45) were asked to drink two doses of 45 mL of sodium phosphate (NaP) with water during the afternoon and evening on the day before the procedure and to drink at least 2 L of water thereafter.
0	2852713	Patients in group C (n=45) drank 2 L of a polyethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol) lavage solution the evening before the procedure.  
0	2852713	Results Overall cleansing of the small bowel was adequate in 43% of patients in group A, 77% of those in group B, and 56% of those in group C (group A vs group B, p=0.001).
0	2852713	Diagnoses for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were established in 9 patients (39%) in group A, 16 patients (69%) in group B, and 14 patients (50%) in group C. No significant difference in diagnostic yield was observed between groups.  
0	2852713	Conclusions Bowel preparation with NaP for capsule endoscopy improved small-bowel mucosal visualization when compared to 12-h overnight fasting.
0	3640892	Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) causes significant stress for the rescuers which may cause deficiencies in attention and increase distractibility.
0	3640892	This may lead to misjudgements of priorities and delays in Cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance, which may further increase mental stress (vicious cycle).
0	3640892	This study assessed the impact of a task-focusing strategy on perceived stress levels and performance during a simulated Cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario.  
0	3640892	Methods This prospective, randomized-controlled trial was conducted at the simulator-center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.
0	3640892	A total of 124 volunteer medical students were randomized to receive a 10 minute instruction to cope with stress by loudly posing two task-focusing questions (“what is the patient’s condition?
0	3640892	”, “what immediate action is needed?
0	3640892	”) when feeling overwhelmed by stress (intervention group) or a control group.
0	3640892	The primary outcome was the perceived levels of stress and feeling overwhelmed (stress/overload); secondary outcomes were hands-on time, time to start Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and number of leadership statements.  
0	3640892	Results Participants in the intervention group reported significantly less stress/overload levels compared to the control group (mean difference: -0.6 (95% CI −1.3, -0.1), p=0.04).
0	3640892	Higher stress/overload was associated with less hands-on time.
0	3640892	Leadership statements did not differ between groups, but the number of leadership statements did relate to performance.
0	3640892	Hands-on time was longer in the intervention- group, but the difference was not statistically significant (difference 5.5 (95% CI −3.1, 14.2), p=0.2); there were no differences in time to start Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (difference −1.4 (95% CI −8.4, 5.7), p=0.71).  
0	3640892	Conclusions A brief stress-coping strategy moderately decreased perceived stress without significantly affecting performance in a simulated Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
0	3640892	Further studies should investigate more intense interventions for reducing stress.

0	3525317	Acupuncture is commonly performed at acupoints.
0	3525317	No comparisons of quantitative physiological alterations in the brachial artery (brachial artery) induced by the stimulation of different acupoints in the lower limbs have been performed in humans.
0	3525317	Therefore, we investigated changes in blood flow volume (blood flow volume) in the brachial artery as an indicator of the physiological effects induced by stimulation at 3 points.
0	3525317	Seventy-five healthy participants aged 33 ± 9 years (mean ± SD) were enrolled and randomly assigned to 3 groups; they received stimulation at 3 different points located on the lower limbs: ST36, LR3, and a non-acupoint.
0	3525317	Stimulation was performed bilaterally with manual rotation of the needles.
0	3525317	Using ultrasonography, blood flow volume was measured continuously from rest to 180 seconds after stimulation.
0	3525317	LR3 stimulation significantly increased blood flow volume compared to that before needle insertion.
0	3525317	Meanwhile, stimulation at ST36 and the non-acupoint significantly decreased blood flow volume compared to that before needle insertion.
0	3525317	Stimulation at LR3 elicited a significant increase in blood flow volume compared to that at ST36 and the non-acupoint.
0	3525317	The results suggest that the stimulation of different points on the lower limbs causes distinct physiological effects on blood flow volume in the brachial artery.
0	1097728	Background Executive walk rounds (Executive walk rounds) are a widely used but unstudied activity designed to improve safety culture in hospitals.
0	1097728	Therefore, we measured the impact of Executive walk rounds on one important part of safety culture – provider attitudes about the safety climate in the institution.  
0	1097728	Methods Randomized study of Executive walk rounds for 23 clinical units in a tertiary care teaching hospital.
0	1097728	All providers except physicians participated.
0	1097728	Executive walk rounds were conducted at each unit by one of six hospital executives once every four weeks for three visits.
0	1097728	Providers were asked about their concerns regarding patient safety and what could be done to improve patient safety.
0	1097728	Suggestions were tabulated and when possible, changes were made.
0	1097728	Provider attitudes about safety climate measured by the Safety Climate Survey before and after Executive walk rounds.
0	1097728	We report mean scores, percent positive scores (percentage of providers who responded four or higher on a five point scale (agree slightly or agree strongly), and the odds of EWR participants agreeing with individual survey items when compared to non-participants.  
0	1097728	Results Before Executive walk rounds the mean safety climate scores for nurses were similar in the control units and EWR units (78.97 and 76.78, P = 0.458) as were percent positive scores (64.6% positive and 61.1% positive).
0	1097728	After Executive walk rounds the mean safety climate scores were not significantly different for all providers nor for nurses in the control units and EWR units (77.93 and 78.33, P = 0.854) and (56.5% positive and 62.7% positive).
0	1097728	However, when analyzed by exposure to Executive walk rounds, nurses in the control group who did not participate in Executive walk rounds (n = 198) had lower safety climate scores than nurses in the intervention group who did participate in an EWR session (n = 85) (74.88 versus 81.01, P = 0.02; 52.5% positive versus 72.9% positive).
0	1097728	Compared to nurses who did not participate, nurses in the experimental group who reported participating in Executive walk rounds also responded more favorably to a majority of items on the survey.  
0	1097728	Conclusion Executive walk rounds have a positive effect on the safety climate attitudes of nurses who participate in the walk rounds sessions.
0	1097728	Executive walk rounds are a promising tool to improve safety climate and the broader construct of safety culture.
0	3590695	Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers amongst women in developed and developing countries.
0	3590695	It is associated with the highest mortality rate in low to average-income countries.
0	3590695	Breast cancer investigation amongst Iranian women reveals that the number of its incidence is yet the highest in all cancer types.
0	3590695	Despite recent longer survival time of women with breast cancer, most of the patients suffer from long term physical and mental distress due to combined treatments.
0	3590695	Exercise interventions are among new approaches to promote the better quality of life of the patients, which has only recently been considered by researchers.
0	3590695	This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise intervention on the quality of life of breast cancer survivors.  
0	3590695	Materials and Methods: This is a clinical trial conducted on 80 women with I-III breast cancer, at 18-55 years of age mostly two years after the completion of their treatment in Seyed al Shohada hospital in Isfahan.
0	3590695	They were randomly divided into two groups of study and control.
0	3590695	Exercise intervention went on for 8 weeks in the study group (three sessions a week, 60 minutes).
0	3590695	Quality of life in both groups was measured a day before, and at the end of the eight weeks period by the instrument of the National Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute.
0	3590695	The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical tests of X2, t-test and Mac Hammer test.  
0	3590695	Findings: Results showed that there was no significant difference in the mean score of the physical dimension of quality of life in the study group before and after intervention while the score of physical health was significantly better in the control group (p < 0.00).The mean score of mental dimension had increased in the study group, while it had decreased in the control group.
0	3590695	The mean score of social health showed no significant difference before and after intervention.
0	3590695	The mean score of spiritual health had significantly decreased in the control group, while it had significantly increased in the study group (p = 0.004).
0	3590695	Generally, the total mean score of the quality of life showed no significant difference before and after intervention.
0	3590695	However, the percentage of the quality of life score increased in the study group, but decreased in the control group.  
0	3590695	Conclusions: The results of this study showed that exercise interventions can promote a better quality of life for the patients, and increase the total score of quality of life.
0	3590695	Although, the total score of quality of life was not significantly different, it was concluded that exercise can promote the quality of life amongst patients with breast cancer.
0	5293238	Background Previous studies have shown that increases in LDL-cholesterol resulting from substitution of dietary saturated fat for carbohydrate or unsaturated fat are due primarily to increases in large cholesterol-enriched LDL, with minimal changes in small, dense LDL particles and apolipoprotein B. However, individuals can differ by their LDL particle distribution, and it is possible that this may influence LDL subclass response.  
0	5293238	Objective The objective of this study was to test whether the reported effects of saturated fat apply to individuals with atherogenic dyslipidemia as characterized by a preponderance of small LDL particles (LDL phenotype B).  
0	5293238	Methods Fifty-three phenotype B men and postmenopausal women consumed a baseline diet (55%E carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, 8%E saturated fat) for 3 weeks, after which they were randomized to either a moderate carbohydrate, very high saturated fat diet (high saturated fat diet; 39%E carbohydrate, 25%E protein, 36%E fat, 18%E saturated fat) or low saturated fat diet (low saturated fat diet; 37%E carbohydrate, 25%E protein, 37%E fat, 9%E saturated fat) for 3 weeks.  
0	5293238	Results Compared to the low saturated fat diet diet, consumption of the high saturated fat diet diet resulted in significantly greater increases from baseline (% change; 95% CI) in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B (high saturated fat diet vs. low saturated fat diet: 9.5; 3.6 to 15.7 vs. -6.8; -11.7 to -1.76; p = 0.0003) and medium (8.8; -1.3 to 20.0 vs. -7.3; -15.7 to 2.0; p = 0.03), small (6.1; -10.3 to 25.6 vs. -20.8; -32.8 to -6.7; p = 0.02), and total LDL (3.6; -3.2 to 11.0 vs. -7.9; -13.9 to -1.5; p = 0.03) particles, with no differences in change of large and very small LDL concentrations.
0	5293238	As expected, total-cholesterol (11.0; 6.5 to 15.7 vs. -5.7; -9.4 to -1.8; p<0.0001) and LDL-cholesterol (16.7; 7.9 to 26.2 vs. -8.7; -15.4 to -1.4; p = 0.0001) also increased with increased saturated fat intake.  
0	5293238	Conclusions Because medium and small LDL particles are more highly associated with cardiovascular disease than are larger LDL, the present results suggest that very high saturated fat intake may increase cardiovascular disease risk in phenotype B individuals.

0	3534307	The diagnostic and clinical usefulness of a powered bone marrow biopsy device (OnControl()) versus a standard manual device (TRAP Hospital System) was studied.
0	3534307	Primary endpoints were biopsy quality and patient pain during the procedure.
0	3534307	Fifty patients underwent a total of 60 procedures by three expert operators in a randomised stratified fashion.
0	3534307	Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were similar in both groups.
0	3534307	The usage of conscious sedation, dosage of lidocaine/pethidin was similar between groups.
0	3534307	Biopsy quality was rated ‘sufficient for diagnosis’ in 24/30 in the control group and 25/30 in the powered group (p=0.74).
0	3534307	Biopsy cylinder length, procedure time (from skin contact of the biopsy needle to placement of the biopsy cylinder in the formalin container) and patient reported pain during the procedure (T1), 15 min after the procedure (T2) and 3–5 days after the procedure (T3) there were comparable between groups.
0	3534307	In the small subgroup of patients that did not receive conscious sedation (n=15; manual 6, powered 9) significantly lower median pain scores were observed with the powered system (median pain score 3 vs 7; p=0.015).
0	3534307	Patients were satisfied with either device whether sedation was used (sedation: median 9 for both groups, range 3–10 (manual) and 0–10 (powered)) no sedation (median 8 (manual) vs 9 (powered)).
0	3534307	In summary bone marrow biopsies taken with the manual or powered device produce similar technical and clinical results.
0	3534307	If no conscious sedation is used, pain during the procedure appears to be lower with the powered system.
0	3534307	The use of a powered system seems to be justified in selected patients.
0	1976090	Background Systemic hypertension often accompanies chronic renal failure and can accelerate its progression to end-stage renal disease (end-stage renal disease).
0	1976090	Adjunctive moxonidine appeared to have benefits versus adjunctive nitrendipine, in a randomised double-blind six-month trial in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure.
0	1976090	To understand the longer term effects and costs of moxonidine, a decision analytic model was developed and a cost-effectiveness analysis performed.  
0	1976090	Methods A Markov model was used to extrapolate results from the trial over three years.
0	1976090	All patients started in a non-ESRD state.
0	1976090	After each cycle, patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 15 ml/min had progressed to an end-stage renal disease state.
0	1976090	The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the Dutch healthcare perspective.
0	1976090	The main outcome measure was incremental cost per life-year gained.
0	1976090	The percentage of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease and cumulative costs were also compared after three years.
0	1976090	In the base case analysis, all patients with end-stage renal disease received dialysis.  
0	1976090	Results The model predicted that after three years, 38.9% (95%CI 31.8–45.8) of patients treated with nitrendipine progressed to end-stage renal disease compared to 7.5% (95%CI 3.5–12.7) of patients treated with moxonidine.
0	1976090	Treatment with standard antihypertensive therapy and adjunctive moxonidine was predicted to reduce the number of end-stage renal disease cases by 81% over three years compared to adjunctive nitrendipine.
0	1976090	The cumulative costs per patient were significantly lower in the moxonidine group €9,858 (95% CI 5,501–16,174) than in the nitrendipine group €37,472 (95% CI 27,957–49,478).
0	1976090	The model showed moxonidine to be dominant compared to nitrendipine, increasing life-years lived by 0.044 (95%CI 0.020–0.070) years and at a cost-saving of €27,615 (95%CI 16,894–39,583) per patient.
0	1976090	Probabilistic analyses confirmed that the moxonidine strategy was dominant over nitrendipine in over 98.9% of cases.
0	1976090	The cumulative 3-year costs and LYL continued to favour the moxonidine strategy in all sensitivity analyses performed.  
0	1976090	Conclusion Treatment with standard antihypertensive therapy and adjunctive moxonidine in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure was predicted to reduce the number of new end-stage renal disease cases over three years compared to adjunctive nitrendipine.
0	1976090	The model showed that adjunctive moxonidine could increase life-years lived and provide long term cost savings.
0	5870086	Background Intranasal oxytocin (oxytocin) has been shown to improve social communication functioning of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder) and, thus, has received considerable interest as a potential autism spectrum disorder therapeutic agent.
0	5870086	Although preclinical research indicates that oxytocin modulates the functional output of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system that processes rewards, no clinical brain imaging study to date has examined the effects of oxytocin on this system using a reward processing paradigm.
0	5870086	To address this, we used an incentive delay task to examine the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin, versus placebo (placebo), on neural responses to social and nonsocial rewards in children with autism spectrum disorder.  
0	5870086	Methods In this placebo-controlled double-blind study, 28 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (age: M = 13.43 years, SD = 2.36) completed two fMRI scans, one after intranasal oxytocin administration and one after placebo administration.
0	5870086	During both scanning sessions, participants completed social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks.
0	5870086	Task-based neural activation and connectivity were examined to assess the impact of oxytocin relative to placebo on mesocorticolimbic brain responses to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes.  
0	5870086	Results Central analyses compared the oxytocin and placebo conditions.
0	5870086	During nonsocial reward anticipation, there was greater activation in the right nucleus accumbens (nucleus accumbens), left anterior cingulate cortex (anterior cingulate cortex), bilateral orbital frontal cortex (orbital frontal cortex), left superior frontal cortex, and right frontal pole (frontal pole) during the oxytocin condition relative to placebo.
0	5870086	Alternatively, during social reward anticipation and outcomes, there were no significant increases in brain activation during the oxytocin condition relative to placebo.
0	5870086	A Treatment Group × Reward Condition interaction revealed relatively greater activation in the right nucleus accumbens, right caudate nucleus, left anterior cingulate cortex, and right orbital frontal cortex during nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation during the oxytocin condition relative to placebo.
0	5870086	Additionally, these analyses revealed greater activation during nonsocial reward outcomes during the oxytocin condition relative to placebo in the right orbital frontal cortex and left frontal pole.
0	5870086	Finally, functional connectivity analyses generally revealed changes in frontostriatal connections during the oxytocin condition relative to placebo in response to nonsocial, but not social, rewards.  
0	5870086	Conclusions The effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on mesocorticolimbic brain systems that process rewards in autism spectrum disorder were observable primarily during the processing of nonsocial incentive salience stimuli.
0	5870086	These findings have implications for understanding the effects of oxytocin on neural systems that process rewards, as well as for experimental trials of novel autism spectrum disorder treatments developed to ameliorate social communication impairments in autism spectrum disorder.

0	31582	Background: Biphasic positive airway pressure (Biphasic positive airway pressure) (also known as PeV+) is a mode of ventilation with cycling variations between two continuous positive airway pressure levels.
0	31582	In adults this mode of ventilation is effective and is being accepted with a decrease in need for sedatives because of the ability to breathe spontaneously during the entire breathing cycle.
0	31582	We studied the use of Biphasic positive airway pressure in infants and children.  
0	31582	Methods: We randomized 18 patients with respiratory failure for ventilation with either Biphasic positive airway pressure (n = 11) or assisted spontaneous breathing (assisted spontaneous breathing) (n = 7) on Evita 4.
0	31582	Lorazepam and, if necessary, morphine were used as sedatives and adjusted in accordance with the Comfort scale.
0	31582	We compared number of randomized mode failure, duration and complications of ventilation and number and dosages of sedatives administered.  
0	31582	Results: No differences in patient characteristics, ventilatory parameters, complications of ventilation or use of sedatives were noted.
0	31582	Ten out of eleven patients that we intended to ventilate with Biphasic positive airway pressure were successfully ventilated with Biphasic positive airway pressure.
0	31582	Four out of seven patients that we intended to ventilate with assisted spontaneous breathing could not be ventilated adequately with assisted spontaneous breathing but were successfully crossed over to Biphasic positive airway pressure without the need for further sedatives.  
0	31582	Conclusions: Biphasic positive airway pressure is an effective, safe and easy to use mode of ventilation in infants and children.
0	4743514	Background In surgical procedures, obesity is a risk factor for the onset of intra and postoperative respiratory complications.  
0	4743514	Aim Determine what moment of application of positive pressure brings better benefits on lung function, incidence of atelectasis and diaphragmatic excursion, in the preoperative, intraoperative or immediate postoperative period.  
0	4743514	Method Randomized, controlled, blinded study, conducted in a hospital and included subjects with BMI between 40 and 55 kg/m2, 25 and 55 years, underwent bariatric surgery by laparotomy.
0	4743514	They were underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluations.
0	4743514	They were allocated into four different groups: 1) Gpre: treated with positive pressure in the BiPAP mode (Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure) before surgery for one hour; 2) Gpos: BIPAP after surgery for one hour; 3) Gintra: Positive End Expiratory Pressure (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) at 10 cmH2O during the surgery; 4) Gcontrol: only conventional respiratory physiotherapy.
0	4743514	The evaluation consisted of anthropometric data, pulmonary function tests and chest radiography.  
0	4743514	Results Were allocated 40 patients, 10 in each group.
0	4743514	There were significant differences for the expiratory reserve volume and percentage of the predicted expiratory reserve volume, in which the groups that received treatment showed a smaller loss in expiratory reserve volume from the preoperative to postoperative stages.
0	4743514	The postoperative radiographic analysis showed a 25% prevalence of atelectasis for Gcontrol, 11.1% for Gintra, 10% for Gpre, and 0% for Gpos.
0	4743514	There was no significant difference in diaphragmatic mobility amongst the groups.  
0	4743514	Conclusion The optimal time of application of positive pressure is in the immediate postoperative period, immediately after extubation, because it reduces the incidence of atelectasis and there is reduction of loss of expiratory reserve volume.
0	3566922	Background Children are most vulnerable to malaria.
0	3566922	A pyronaridine-artesunate pediatric granule formulation is being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.  
0	3566922	Methods This phase III, multi-center, comparative, open-label, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial included patients aged ≤12 years, bodyweight ≥5 to <25 kg, with a reported history of fever at inclusion or in the previous 24 h and microscopically-confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
0	3566922	Patients were randomized (2:1) to pyronaridine-artesunate granules (60/20 mg) once daily or artemether-lumefantrine crushed tablets (20/120 mg) twice daily, both dosed by bodyweight, orally (liquid suspension) for three days.  
0	3566922	Results Of 535 patients randomized, 355 received pyronaridine-artesunate and 180 received artemether-lumefantrine.
0	3566922	Day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (adequate clinical and parasitological response), corrected for re-infection using polymerase chain reaction (polymerase chain reaction) genotyping (per-protocol population) was 97.1% (329/339; 95% CI 94.6, 98.6) for pyronaridine-artesunate; 98.8% (165/167; 95% CI 95.7, 99.9) for artemether-lumefantrine.
0	3566922	The primary endpoint was achieved: pyronaridine-artesunate PCR-corrected day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response was statistically significantly >90% (P < .0001).
0	3566922	Pyronaridine-artesunate was non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine: treatment difference -1.8% (95% CI -4.3 to 1.6).
0	3566922	The incidence of drug-related adverse events was 37.2% (132/355) with pyronaridine-artesunate, 44.4% (80/180) with artemether-lumefantrine.
0	3566922	Clinical biochemistry results showed similar mean changes versus baseline in the two treatment groups.
0	3566922	From day 3 until study completion, one patient in each treatment group had peak alanine aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase) >
0	3566922	3 times the upper limit of normal (upper limit of normal) and peak total bilirubin >2xULN (i.e. within the Hy’s law definition).  
0	3566922	Conclusions The pyronaridine-artesunate pediatric granule formulation was efficacious and was non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine.
0	3566922	The adverse event profile was similar for the two comparators.
0	3566922	Pyronaridine-artesunate should be considered for inclusion in paediatric malaria treatment programmes.

0	5916649	Abstract  Background: Adjuvant perineural dexmedetomidine can be used to prolong the analgesic effect of interscalene brachial plexus block (interscalene brachial plexus block).
0	5916649	We investigated the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine in interscalene brachial plexus block for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.  
0	5916649	Methods: One hundred patients scheduled for elective shoulder arthroscopic surgery were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind study.
0	5916649	Ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block was performed before general anesthesia using 22 mL of ropivacaine 0.5% combined with 1, 1.5, or 2 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine (group D1, D2, and D3, respectively) or with normal saline as a control (group R, n = 25 per group).
0	5916649	The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia (duration of analgesia), numeric pain rating scale (numeric pain rating scale), and consumption of additional analgesics during 36 h after interscalene brachial plexus block.
0	5916649	Secondary outcome included durations of motor and sensory block (DOM and DOS), hemodynamic variables and sedation and dyspnea scores.  
0	5916649	Results: Ninety-seven patients completed the study.
0	5916649	The DOS, DOM, and duration of analgesia were significantly longer in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group R.
0	5916649	The duration of analgesia was significantly longer in group D3 than in groups D1 (P = .026) and D2 (P = .039).
0	5916649	The duration of analgesia was 808.13 ± 179.97, 1032.60 ± 288.14, 1042.04 ± 188.13, and 1223.96 ± 238.06 min in groups R, D1, D2, and D3, respectively.
0	5916649	The numeric pain rating scale score was significantly higher in group R than in the dexmedetomidine groups 12 h after interscalene brachial plexus block (P < .001) and significantly lower in group D3 than in the other groups 18 h after interscalene brachial plexus block (P = .02).
0	5916649	The incidence of hypotension was higher in groups D2 and D3 than in group R during surgery (P = .008 and P = .011, respectively).
0	5916649	There were no significant differences in consumption of rescue analgesics, sedation, and dyspnea scores between the study groups.  
0	5916649	Conclusion: Perineural dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg could be the optimal dose in interscalene brachial plexus block for arthroscopic shoulder surgery in that it provides an adequate duration of analgesia.
0	5916649	However, this dose was associated with increased risk of hypotension.
0	5984593	Objectives Expectation can significantly modulate pain and treatment effects.
0	5984593	This study aims to investigate if boosting patients' expectancy can enhance the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (knee osteoarthritis), and its underlying brain mechanism.  
0	5984593	Methods Seventy-four knee osteoarthritis patients were recruited and randomized to three groups: boosted acupuncture (with a manipulation to enhance expectation), standard acupuncture, or treatment as usual (treatment as usual).
0	5984593	Each patient underwent six treatments before being debriefed, and four additional treatments after being debriefed.
0	5984593	The fMRI scans were applied during the first and sixth treatment sessions.  
0	5984593	Results We found significantly decreased knee pain in the boosted acupuncture group compared to the standard acupuncture or treatment as usual groups after both six and ten treatments.
0	5984593	Resting state functional connectivity (Resting state functional connectivity) analyses using the nucleus accumbens (nucleus accumbens) as the seed showed Resting state functional connectivity increases between the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (/rostral anterior cingulate cortex) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the boosted group as compared to the standard acupuncture group after multiple treatments.
0	5984593	Expectancy scores after the first treatment were significantly associated with increased NAc-rACC/MPFC Resting state functional connectivity and decreased knee pain following treatment.  
0	5984593	Conclusions Our study provides a novel method and mechanism for boosting the treatment of pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
0	5984593	Our findings may shed light on enhancing outcomes of pharmacological and integrative medicines in clinical settings.
0	4711001	Background To determine if testosterone levels are influenced by dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson disease (Parkinson disease) patients.
0	4711001	Testosterone level has been reported to be low in patients with Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0	4711001	In this study, we sought to determine whether dopaminergic therapy (i.e. levodopa and dopamine agonist) influenced testosterone levels.
0	4711001	We used a cohort of consecutive male patients from the INSPECT trial--a multi-center, prospective, study that primarily investigated the effects of short-term treatment with pramipexole or levodopa on [123I] B-CIT SPECT imaging in early Parkinson disease.  
0	4711001	Methods Testosterone levels were drawn on consenting male subjects with early Parkinson disease who enrolled in the INSPECT trial at three study visits (baseline, 12 weeks post-treatment, and 8–12 weeks post-washout).
0	4711001	Subjects were randomized to: no treatment, pramipexole (up to 3 mg) or levodopa (up to 600 mg).
0	4711001	Testosterone levels were obtained twice (prior to 10 AM) and averaged for each of three study visits.  
0	4711001	Results Thirty two male patients participated in this sub-study and there were no significant differences in disease characteristics in the 3 groups at baseline.
0	4711001	Twenty-nine patients completed the follow-up visits and were suitable for analysis.
0	4711001	There were statistically significant differences in the change in free testosterone level, increased in both the levodopa group and pramipexole group but decreased in the untreated group at 12-weeks post-treatment.
0	4711001	There were no significant differences in the changes of UPDRS total or motor scores, although there was a strong trend toward improvement in motor scores.
0	4711001	The testosterone level persisted in its increase only in the pramipexole group at the end of the washout period.  
0	4711001	Conclusion These preliminary data support the premise that dopaminergic medications do not reduce testosterone levels in early Parkinson disease patients.

0	4920480	Purpose To evaluate the effect of financial incentive in a diabetes prevention weight loss program at worksites.  
0	4920480	Design Group-level randomized intervention study.  
0	4920480	Setting Four long-term care facilities, randomly assigned to “incentive-IG” or “non incentive-NIG” groups.  
0	4920480	Participants Ninety-nine employees, all overweight or obese (BMI= mean 34.8±7.4 kg/m2) and at risk for type 2 diabetes.  
0	4920480	Intervention A 16 week weight loss program (diabetes prevention program) with a 3 month follow up.
0	4920480	IG could either choose a "standard incentive" to receive cash award when achieving the projected weight loss or to participate in a "standard plus deposit incentive" to get additional money matched with their deposit for projected weight loss.
0	4920480	All of the participants received a one-hour consultation for a healthy weight loss at the beginning.  
0	4920480	Measures Weight-loss, diabetes risk score (diabetes risk score), and cardiovascular risk outcomes.  
0	4920480	Analyses Linear and logistic regressions for completed cases with adjustments for clustering effect at group level.  
0	4920480	Results IG lost on average more pounds (p=0.027), reduced BMI (p=0.04), and reduced in diabetes risk score (p=0.011) compared to NIG at week 16.
0	4920480	At the 12-week follow-up period, those in IG plus deposit subgroup had twice the odds (OR=2.2, p=0.042) and those in the standard IG had three times the odds of achieving weight loss goals than NIG; those in the IG plus deposit group reduced diabetes risk score by 0.4 (p=0.045).  
0	4920480	Conclusion Monetary incentives appear to be effective in reducing weight and diabetes risk.
0	5426451	Objective To identify and investigate differences in spinal fusion between the normal and osteopenic spine in a rat model.  
0	5426451	Methods Female Sprague Dawley rats underwent either an ovariectomy (OVX) or sham operation and were randomized into two groups: non-OVX group and OVX group.
0	5426451	Eight weeks after OVX, unilateral lumbar spinal fusion was performed using autologous iliac bone.
0	5426451	Bone density (Bone density) was measured 2 days and 8 weeks after fusion surgery.
0	5426451	Microcomputed tomography was used to evaluate the process of bone fusion every two weeks for 8 weeks after fusion surgery.
0	5426451	The fusion rate, fusion process, and bone volume parameters of fusion bed were compared between the two groups.  
0	5426451	Results Bone density was significantly higher in the non-OVX group than in the OVX group 2 days and 8 weeks after fusion surgery.
0	5426451	The fusion rate in the non-OVX group was higher than that in the OVX group 8 weeks after surgery (p=0.044).
0	5426451	The bony connection of bone fragments with transverse processes and bone formation between transverse processes in non-OVX group were significantly superior to those of OVX group from 6 weeks after fusion surgery.
0	5426451	The compactness and bone maturation of fusion bed in non-OVX were prominent compared with the non-OVX group.  
0	5426451	Conclusion The fusion rate in OVX group was inferior to non-OVX group at late stage after fusion surgery.
0	5426451	Bone maturation of fusion bed in the OVX group was inferior compared with the non-OVX group.
0	5426451	Fusion enhancement strategies at early stage may be needed to patients with osteoporosis who need spine fusion surgery.
0	1557723	Introduction Experimental and clinical data show that the oral bisphosphonate clodronate (Bonefos®) can inhibit tumor-induced osteoclastic bone resorption.
0	1557723	This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was designed to determine if the addition of oral clodronate to standard treatment for primary operable breast cancer could reduce the subsequent occurrence of bone metastases and thereby improve overall survival.  
0	1557723	Methods 1,069 patients with primary operable stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to receive oral clodronate (1,600 mg/day) or placebo for 2 years, in conjunction with standard treatment for primary breast cancer including surgery, radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or tamoxifen.
0	1557723	All patients were assessed for bone metastases at two and five years and additionally when clinically indicated.
0	1557723	Survival status was determined as of the close of the study on 30 June 2000 with a median follow up of 5.6 years.
0	1557723	The treatment arms were compared using the unstratified log-rank test.
0	1557723	Hazard ratios (Hazard ratios) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.  
0	1557723	Results Oral clodronate significantly reduced the risk of bone metastases in all patients over the 5 year study period (51 patients versus 73 patients with placebo; HR = 0.692, P = 0.043); the difference was also statistically significant over the 2 year medication period (19 patients versus 35 patients with placebo; HR = 0.546, P = 0.031).
0	1557723	These differences were most pronounced in patients with stage II/III disease (39 patients versus 64 patients with placebo, HR = 0.592, P = 0.009 over 5 years; 16 patients versus 32 patients with placebo, HR= 0.496, P = 0.020 over 2 years).
0	1557723	Survival data also favoured the clodronate arm (HR for all patients = 0.768, P = 0.048; HR for stage II/III disease = 0.743, P = 0.041), although this was not significant due to multiple analyses.
0	1557723	Oral clodronate was well tolerated, with mild-to-moderate diarrhoea being the most frequently reported adverse event.  
0	1557723	Conclusion These results confirm that oral clodronate will significantly improve the 5 year bone relapse free survival when used as a supplementary adjuvant treatment for patients receiving standard treatment for primary operable breast cancer.
0	3544598	Background This multicentre study was carried out in Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal to evaluate the non-inferiority of the new paediatric formulation of artesunate/amodiaquine (AS+AQ)(Camoquin-Plus Paediatric®) in suspension form versus artemether/lumefantrine (AL)(Coartem®) in the management of African children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria.  
0	3544598	Methods It was an open randomized trial including children aged between 7 months and 7 years.
0	3544598	The endpoints were Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response) at day 28, the clinical and biological tolerability.
0	3544598	Statistical analyses were done in Intention To Treat (Intention To Treat) and in Per protocol (Per protocol).  
0	3544598	Results At the end of the study 481 patients were enrolled in the three countries (249 in the artesunate/amodiaquine arm and 232 in the artemether/lumefantrine arm).
0	3544598	ACRP in Intention To Treat after PCR correction did not show any statistical difference between the two groups with 97.6% for artesunate/amodiaquine versus 94.8% for artemether/lumefantrine.
0	3544598	In the Per protocol analysis, the corrected ACRP were respectively 98.7% and 96.9% for the two regimens.
0	3544598	The clinical tolerance was good without significant difference.
0	3544598	Anaemia was significantly higher at D7 in the two groups compared to D0.  
0	3544598	Conclusion This study demonstrates the non-inferiority of artesunate/amodiaquine versus artemether/lumefantrine, its efficacy and tolerance in the management of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in African children.
0	5721510	Aim: The purpose of this clinical study was to compare and clinically, to evaluate the accuracy of six apex locators with intra oral periapical (intra oral periapical) radiograph in multirooted teeth.  
0	5721510	Materials and Methods: A total of 90 multirooted teeth (maxillary and mandibular molars) with irreversible, infected or necrotic pulp tissue and completely formed roots were included in this study and were divided randomly into six groups (Root ZX II, Raypex 6, I-Root, Romiapex A-15, Sybron Endo Mini and Root ZX mini).
0	5721510	The working length was determined using six different apex locators, and the accuracy of the apex locators was compared with intra oral periapical radiographs, to be categorized as accurate, short, and long or beyond.  
0	5721510	Results: A total of 270 canals were evaluated, of which 233 (86.3%) canals exhibited acceptable working length, 28 (10.4%) canals exhibited short working length, and only 9 (3.3%) canals exhibited working length beyond the apex.
0	5721510	There were a statistically significant results in all the groups (P < 0.05) and the comparison between the groups was statistically insignificant.  
0	5721510	Conclusion: The repeatability with that of apex locators is of great advantage, but the information gained from the radiographs cannot be obtained by any other means.
0	5721510	Therefore, it is recommended that radiograph and apex locators are the best combinations in accurately determining the working length and the successful endodontics.
0	3748095	Background This cluster-randomised controlled trial determined the effectiveness of an evidence-based, pamphlet intervention in improving low back pain (LBP)-related beliefs among pharmacy consumers.  
0	3748095	Methods Thirty five community pharmacies were randomised to three groups: pamphlet+education intervention [n = 11]; pamphlet only intervention [n = 11]; control: usual care [n = 13].
0	3748095	Eligibility requirements for clusters included: community-based pharmacies and proprietor participation consent.
0	3748095	Pharmacy consumers (N = 317) aged 18–65 years currently experiencing low back pain participated.
0	3748095	Intervention group allocation depended on the pharmacy attended.
0	3748095	Individual-level outcomes were measured at pre-intervention (T0), at two (T1) and eight (T2) weeks post-intervention and included beliefs about low back pain
0	3748095	[Back Pain Beliefs Questionnaire (Back Pain Beliefs Questionnaire); Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire)].
0	3748095	Secondary outcomes included pain severity, activity impairment and pamphlet perceived usefulness.
0	3748095	Blinding to group allocation included primary investigators, outcome assessors and the statistician.
0	3748095	Pharmacy staff and consumers were un-blinded.  
0	3748095	Results Of 35 pharmacies recruited (317 consumers), no clusters were lost to follow-up.
0	3748095	Follow-up was available for n = 24 at 2 weeks only; n = 38 at 8 weeks only; n = 148 at both time points, with n = 148+24+38 = 210 analysed (107 excluded: no follow up).
0	3748095	Adjusting for baseline scores demonstrated no significant differences in beliefs (2 or at 8 weeks) between pamphlet (with or without education) versus control, or between ‘pamphlet with’ versus ‘without’ education.
0	3748095	Work-related fear (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire) was significantly lower in consumers receiving pamphlet (with or without education) versus control (difference −2.3, 95%CI: −4.4 to −0.2).
0	3748095	There was no significant difference between “pamphlet with” versus “pamphlet without” groups.
0	3748095	Consumers receiving the “pamphlet with” reported greater perceived usefulness than consumers receiving the “pamphlet without” (difference 0.9 (95%CI: 0.0 to 1.8)).  
0	3748095	Conclusion Community pharmacies provided a feasible primary care portal for implementing evidence-based information.
0	3748095	The associated improvement in work-related LBP-beliefs for consumers receiving the pamphlet suggests this simple intervention may be a useful component of care.

0	3510710	Background Web-based self-help programs that reduce problematic substance use are able to reach hidden consumer groups in the general population.
0	3510710	These programs are characterized by their low treatment threshold and nonrestrictive intervention settings.
0	3510710	They are also cost effective, making them of interest to both low-income and high-income industrialized countries with ever-increasing health costs.  
0	3510710	Objective To test the feasibility and effectiveness of an anonymous, fully automated, Web-based self-help intervention as an alternative to outpatient treatment services for cocaine users.  
0	3510710	Methods A total of 196 cocaine-using participants were recruited through various online and offline media for a randomized controlled trial.
0	3510710	Participants in the intervention group received interactive cognitive behavioral modules and a consumption diary to reduce cocaine use, whereas participants in the control group received online psychoeducative information modules.
0	3510710	Web-based follow-up assessments were conducted after 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months.
0	3510710	Treatment retention was examined and compared between the intervention and control groups.
0	3510710	Severity of cocaine dependence was the main outcome measure.
0	3510710	Secondary outcomes were cocaine craving, depression symptoms, and alcohol and other substance use.  
0	3510710	Results This Web-based intervention attracted older and more educated participants than existing outpatient treatment programs for which cocaine is the primary substance of abuse.
0	3510710	Participants in the intervention group showed greater treatment retention compared with the control group (P = .04).
0	3510710	Low response rates at the follow-up assessments restricted the explanatory power of the analyses.
0	3510710	At the follow-up assessments, the severity of cocaine dependence did not differ between the intervention and control groups (P = .75).
0	3510710	Furthermore, there were no differences in cocaine craving, depression, or alcohol and other substance use.
0	3510710	Using the consumption diaries, the average number of cocaine-free days per week did not change significantly, whereas the weekly quantity of cocaine used decreased equally in both groups (P = .009).  
0	3510710	Conclusions For cocaine users with low dependence severity, a fully automated Web-based cognitive behavioral self-help intervention is a feasible alternative with limited effectiveness in outpatient treatment services.
0	3510710	However, this type of intervention may attract specific user groups that are rarely reached by existing outpatient treatment and may help them to control their cocaine consumption anonymously.

0	5688892	Context: Medically unexplained symptoms (Medically unexplained symptoms) are often poorly responsive to standard treatments.  
0	5688892	Aim: The aim of the study is to assess short-term efficacy of adjunctive single session cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based counseling for patients with Medically unexplained symptoms.  
0	5688892	Setting and Design: Randomized controlled trial at a psychosomatic clinic of a tertiary care hospital.  
0	5688892	Materials and Methods: Patients with Medically unexplained symptoms were randomized to receive either the single session counseling (intervention group) (n = 41) or control group which received treatment as usual (n = 35).
0	5688892	The counseling intervention focused on three areas – cognitive reattribution, shifting focus, and guided muscular relaxation and lasted around 30 min.
0	5688892	The two groups were assessed at baseline and after 1 month for change in outcome measures.  
0	5688892	Statistical Analysis Used: Repeated measures analysis of variance.
0	5688892	P value was adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction and set at <0.01 for significance.  
0	5688892	Results: Both groups did not differ on change in the primary outcome measure: Patient Health Questionnaire – 15 scores (P = 0.055).
0	5688892	However, at follow-up, the intervention group showed statistically greater reduction in the number of workdays lost (P = 0.005).
0	5688892	Trend level changes were noted for depressive symptom reduction only in the intervention group (P = 0.022).  
0	5688892	Conclusions: One session CBT-based therapy demonstrates potentially important benefits over standard care among Indian patients with Medically unexplained symptoms.
0	5688892	Further testing in larger samples with longer follow-up periods is therefore recommended.
0	3823994	Objective To evaluate the effect of an improved salt-restriction spoon on the attitude of salt-restriction, the using rate of salt-restriction-spoon, the actual salt intake, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (24HUNa).  
0	3823994	Design A community intervention study.  
0	3823994	Setting Two villages in Beijing.  
0	3823994	Participants 403 local adult residents being responsible for home cooking.  
0	3823994	Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group.
0	3823994	Those in the intervention group were provided with an improved salt-restriction-spoon and health education, and were informed of their actual salt intake and 24HUNa.
0	3823994	Not any intervention was given to those in the control group.  
0	3823994	Main Outcome Measures 
0	3823994	The scores on the variables of Health Belief Model, the using rate of salt-restriction-spoon, the actual salt intake, and 24HUNa.  
0	3823994	Analysis Covariance analyses, Chi-square tests, Student’s t tests, and repeated measures analyses of variance.  
0	3823994	Results After 6 months of intervention, the intervention group felt significantly less objective barriers, and got access to significantly more cues to action as compared to the control group.
0	3823994	The using rate and the correctly using rate of salt-restriction-spoon were significantly higher in the intervention group.
0	3823994	The daily salt intake decreased by 1.42 g in the intervention group and by 0.28 g in the control group, and repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant change over time (F = 7.044, P<0.001) and significant difference between groups by time (F = 2.589, P = 0.041).
0	3823994	The 24HUNa decreased by 34.84 mmol in the intervention group and by 33.65 mmol in the control group, and repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant change over time (F = 14.648, P<0.001) without significant difference between groups by time (F = 0.222, P = 0.870).  
0	3823994	Conclusions The intervention effect was acceptable, therefore, the improved salt-restriction-spoon and corresponding health education could be considered as an alternative for salt reduction strategy in China and other countries where salt intake comes mainly from home cooking.
0	4717542	Background Epidemiological studies reported an association between plasma phosphate concentrations and a higher risk for death and cardiovascular events in subjects free of chronic kidney diseases.
0	4717542	The main aims of the present study were to determine the influence of a high phosphorus intake in combination with different calcium supplies on phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and iron metabolism as well as fibroblast growth factor 23 (fibroblast growth factor 23) concentrations within eight weeks of supplementation.  
0	4717542	Methods Sixty-two healthy subjects completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel designed study.
0	4717542	Supplements were monosodium phosphate and calcium carbonate.
0	4717542	During the first two weeks, all groups consumed a placebo sherbet powder, and afterwards, for eight weeks, a sherbet powder according to the intervention group: P1000/Ca0 (1 g/d phosphorus), P1000/Ca500 (1 g/d phosphorus and 0.5 g/d calcium) and P1000/Ca1000 (1 g/d phosphorus and 1 g/d calcium).
0	4717542	Dietary records, fasting blood samplings, urine and fecal collections took place.  
0	4717542	Results Fasting plasma phosphate concentrations did not change after any intervention.
0	4717542	After all interventions, renal excretions and fecal concentrations of phosphorus increased significantly after eight weeks.
0	4717542	Renal calcium and magnesium excretion decreased significantly after eight weeks of P1000/Ca0 intervention compared to placebo.
0	4717542	Plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 concentrations were significantly higher after four weeks compared to eight weeks of all interventions.  
0	4717542	Conclusions The long-term study showed in healthy adults no influence of high phosphorus intakes on fasting plasma phosphate concentrations.
0	4717542	A high phosphorus intake without adequate calcium intake seems to have negative impact on calcium metabolism.
0	4717542	Plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 concentrations increased four weeks after high phosphorus intake and normalized after eight weeks.  
0	4717542	Trial registration The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02095392.
0	5986231	Background Cutaneous warts are caused by a small group of specific types of human papillomaviruses.
0	5986231	Cryotherapy is a highly effective treatment for patients with viral warts; however, it is a painful method and usually requires several treatment sessions.
0	5986231	Zinc is a trace element with many proven effects on the immune system.  
0	5986231	Objective Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral zinc sulfate in the treatment and recurrence rate of common warts.  
0	5986231	Methods Eighty-three patients with common warts participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
0	5986231	In both groups, three sessions of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy were performed for up to 2 months with 3-week intervals.
0	5986231	The treatment group (n = 45) received oral zinc sulfate capsules in a dose of 10 mg/kg per day up to 600 mg day.
0	5986231	The control group (n = 38) was provided with placebo of similar appearance.
0	5986231	Treatment continued for 2 months and the follow-up period lasted up to 6 months.  
0	5986231	Results Warts completely resolved in 26 patients in the treatment group (68.4%) and 23 patients in the placebo group (63.9%; p = .68).
0	5986231	Three patients (7.9%) in the treatment group and six patients (16.6%) in the placebo group has a recurrence of the warts (p = .19).  
0	5986231	Conclusion According to our study, the addition of zinc to cryotherapy was not beneficial in the treatment of patients with common warts nor did it prevent recurrences.

0	3493831	42 women (study group) received letrozole, 5 mg daily from day 3-7 and recombinant FSH (recombinant FSH) 75IU/day from day 5 continuously till hCG injection.
0	3493831	52 women (control group) underwent continuous stimulation by recombinant FSH (150-225IU/day) from day 2.
0	3493831	GnRH-antagonist (Inj.
0	3493831	Orgalutran 0.25 ml sub-cutaneous) was started at maximum follicle size of 14 in both groups.
0	3493831	Ovulation was triggered by 10,000IU of hCG followed by IVF-ET.
0	3493831	Main outcome measures were total dose of recombinant FSH (IU/cycle), terminal E2 (pg/ml), number of mature follicles, number of oocyte retrieved, transferable embryo, endometrial thickness, pregnancy rate and mean expenditure.
0	3493831	Statistical analysis is done by using SPSS11.  
0	3493831	RESULTS: As compared to control group (1756 ± 75IU), the study group i.e., Let-rFSH received (625 ± 98IU) significantly lower (P = 0.0001) total dose of recombinant FSH.
0	3493831	Terminal E2 was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) in study group than control (830 ± 36 vs. 1076 ± 41 pg/ml) with significant increment in endometrial thickness (P = 0.0008) in study group, (9.1 ± 0.32 vs. 8.7 ± 0.69) which maintained an improved pregnancy rate though nonsignificant.
0	3493831	The risk of hyperstimulation had significantly (P = 0.01) reduced in study group than control (0 vs. 7).Treatment outcome in all other aspects including pregnancy rate were statistically comparable.
0	3493831	Per cycle mean expenditure was reduced by 34% in study group than control.  
0	3493831	CONCLUSION: Adjunctive use of letrozole may be an effective mean of low-cost in vitro fertilization therapy.
0	4644570	Background: Conventional dentoalveolar osseous reconstruction often involves the use of graft materials with or without barrier membranes.  
0	4644570	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of bone induction by bone matrix gelatin (bone matrix gelatin), delivered on an absorbable collagen sponge (absorbable collagen sponge), compared to a placebo (absorbable collagen sponge alone) in human alveolar socket defects.  
0	4644570	Methods:  20 alveolar sockets from 10 healthy adults were studied.
0	4644570	In all cases, both the mandibular premolar area and the contralateral premolar area (as the control site) were involved.
0	4644570	In each of the 10 patients, the extraction sites were filled randomly with bone matrix gelatin and absorbable collagen sponge.
0	4644570	The repair response was examined on day 90.
0	4644570	Qualitative histological and quantitative histometric analysis, including the percentage of new-formed bone fill and density were done.  
0	4644570	Results: Assessment of the alveolar bone indicated that patients treated with bone matrix gelatin had significantly (p<0.05) better bone quality and quantity compared to the controls.
0	4644570	In addition, bone density and histology revealed no differences between the newly induced and native bone.  
0	4644570	Conclusion: The data from this single-blind clinical trial demonstrated that the novel combination of bone matrix gelatin had a striking effect on de novo osseous formation for the bone regeneration.
0	3943841	Objectives To evaluate the effect of a practice-based, culturally appropriate patient education intervention on blood pressure (blood pressure) and treatment adherence among patients of African origin with uncontrolled hypertension.  
0	3943841	Methods Cluster randomised trial involving four Dutch primary care centres and 146 patients (intervention n = 75, control n = 71), who met the following inclusion criteria: self-identified Surinamese or Ghanaian; ≥20 years; treated for hypertension; SBP≥140 mmHg.
0	3943841	All patients received usual hypertension care.
0	3943841	The intervention-group was also offered three nurse-led, culturally appropriate hypertension education sessions.
0	3943841	blood pressure was assessed with Omron 705-IT and treatment adherence with lifestyle- and medication adherence scales.  
0	3943841	Results 139 patients (95%) completed the study (intervention n = 71, control n = 68).
0	3943841	Baseline characteristics were largely similar for both groups.
0	3943841	At six months, we observed a SBP reduction of ≥10 mmHg -primary outcome- in 48% of the intervention group and 43% of the control group.
0	3943841	When adjusted for pre-specified covariates age, sex, hypertension duration, education, baseline measurement and clustering effect, the between-group difference was not significant (OR; 0.42; 95% CI: 0.11 to 1.54; P = 0.19).
0	3943841	At six months, the mean SBP/DBD had dropped by 10/5.7 (SD 14.3/9.2)mmHg in the intervention group and by 6.3/1.7 (SD 13.4/8.6)mmHg in the control group.
0	3943841	After adjustment, between-group differences in SBP and DBP reduction were −1.69 mmHg (95% CI: −6.01 to 2.62, P = 0.44) and −3.01 mmHg (−5.73 to −0.30, P = 0.03) in favour of the intervention group.
0	3943841	Mean scores for adherence to lifestyle recommendations increased in the intervention group, but decreased in the control group.
0	3943841	Mean medication adherence scores improved slightly in both groups.
0	3943841	After adjustment, the between-group difference for adherence to lifestyle recommendations was 0.34 (0.12 to 0.55; P = 0.003).
0	3943841	For medication adherence it was −0.09 (−0.65 to 0.46; P = 0.74).  
0	3943841	Conclusion This intervention led to significant improvements in DBP and adherence to lifestyle recommendations, supporting the need for culturally appropriate hypertension care.

0	3364678	Background: There is no clear data about the optimum time for chest tube removal after coronary artery bypass surgery.  
0	3364678	Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the chest tube removal time following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery on the clinical outcome of the patients.  
0	3364678	Material and Methods: An analysis of data from 307 patients was performed.
0	3364678	The patients were randomized into two groups: in group 1 (N=107) chest tubes were removed within the first 24 hours after surgery, whereas in group 2 (N=200), chest tubes were removed in the second 24 hours after surgery.
0	3364678	Demographics, lactate and pH at the beginning, during and after the operation, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, inotropic drugs administration, length of ICU stay, and mortality data were collected.
0	3364678	Respiratory rate and pain level was assessed.  
0	3364678	Results: In these surgeries, the mean± standard deviation for the aortic clamping time was 49.18±17.59 minutes and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 78.39±25.12 minutes.
0	3364678	The amount of heparin consumed by the second group was higher (P <0.001) which could be considered as an important factor in increasing the drainage time after the surgery (P =0.047).
0	3364678	The pain level evaluated 24 hours post-operation was lower in the first group, and the difference in the pain level between the 2 groups evaluated 30 hours post-operation was significant (P=0.016).
0	3364678	The mean time of intensive care unit stay was longer in the second group but it was not statistically significant.  
0	3364678	Conclusion: Early extracting of chest tubes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery when there is no significant drainage can lead to pain reduction and consuming oxygen is an effective measure after surgery toward healing; it doesn′t increase the risk of creation of plural effusion and pericardial effusion.
0	4233228	Background There are few comparative studies about the optimal method of pneumatic compression to prevent deep vein thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis).
0	4233228	The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare venous hemodynamic changes and their clinical influences between two graded sequential compression groups (an alternate sequential compression device [alternate sequential compression device] vs. a simultaneous sequential compression device [simultaneous sequential compression device]).  
0	4233228	Methods In total, 34 patients (68 limbs) undergoing knee and spine operations were prospectively randomized into two device groups (alternate sequential compression device vs. simultaneous sequential compression device groups).
0	4233228	Duplex ultrasonography examinations were performed on the 4th and 7th postoperative days for the detection of deep vein thrombosis and the evaluation of venous hemodynamics.
0	4233228	Continuous data for the two groups were analyzed using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test.
0	4233228	Relative frequencies of unpaired samples were compared using Fisher exact test.
0	4233228	Mixed effects models that might be viewed as ANCOVA models were also considered.  
0	4233228	Results deep vein thrombosis developed in 7 patients (20.6%), all of whom were asymptomatic for isolated calf deep vein thrombosiss.
0	4233228	Two of these patients were from the alternate sequential compression device group (11.8%) and the other five were from the simultaneous sequential compression device group (29.4%), but there was no significant difference (p = 0.331).
0	4233228	Baseline peak velocity, mean velocity, peak volume flow, and total volume flow were enhanced significantly in both device groups (p < 0.001).
0	4233228	However, the degrees of flow and velocity enhancement did not differ significantly between the groups.
0	4233228	The accumulated expelled volumes for an hour were in favor of the alternate sequential compression device group.  
0	4233228	Conclusions Both graded sequential compression devices showed similar results both in clinical and physiological efficacies.
0	4233228	Further studies are required to investigate the optimal intermittent pneumatic compression method for enhanced hemodynamic efficacy and better thromboprophylaxis.
0	5799991	Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare canal transportation of two single-file systems, WaveOne Gold and Neoniti, using cone-beam computed tomography (cone-beam computed tomography).  
0	5799991	Methodology: A total of 40 mesiobuccal canals of maxillary first molars with curvatures of 15°–30° were chosen and randomly divided into two experimental groups (n = 20).
0	5799991	In both groups, glide path was established using ProGlider.
0	5799991	In group 1, canals were shaped with WaveOne Gold and in group 2 with Neoniti A1, respectively.
0	5799991	According to manufacturer's instructions, canal preparation was made.
0	5799991	Canals were scanned before and after instrumentation using cone-beam computed tomography scanner to evaluate root canal transportation at 3, 5, and 7 mm from the apex.
0	5799991	Data were statistically analyzed, and significance level was set at P < 0.05.  Results: Mesiodistal and buccolingual transportation showed a statistically significant difference at 3 mm (P = 0.009) and 7 mm (P = 0.002), respectively, when instrumented with Neoniti than WaveOne Gold.  
0	5799991	Conclusion: WaveOne Gold single reciprocation file respected original canal anatomy better than Neoniti single continuous file
0	32174	Background Stroke patients' care in hospital tends to be poorly organised, with poor communication and a lack of information being frequent sources of complaint.
0	32174	The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a patient-held record (patient-held record) would result in greater patient satisfaction and better care planning for stroke patients.  
0	32174	Methods A time series control (6 months) - intervention (8 months) - control (6 months) was used among London teaching hospital general medical and geriatric medicine inpatient wards.
0	32174	All stroke patients admitted to the wards during the intervention phase received a patient-held record and were instructed in its use.
0	32174	Demographic, stroke severity, social factors and outcomes were collected from all stroke patients during all phases of the study.  
0	32174	Results Of 252 stroke patients aged 46 to 98 years entered into the study, by six months after admission 118 (46.8%) had died.
0	32174	patient-held record and control group patients were well matched in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and pre-stroke ability.
0	32174	At six months after admission, 119 (97%) patients responded to the questionnaire.
0	32174	Just over half (56%, 13) of intervention group patients recalled receiving a patient-held record.
0	32174	Of those patients, 59% reported reading the patient-held record, 27% had lost their patient-held record, and two-thirds said they had difficulties encouraging staff to write in the patient-held record.
0	32174	Half felt that possession of the patient-held record was more trouble than it was worth.
0	32174	patient-held record group patients were more satisfied with the recovery they had made (79% vs. 59%, p=0.04), but felt less able to talk to staff about their problems (61% vs. 82%, p=0.02).
0	32174	patient-held record group patients reported receiving fewer explanations about their condition (18% vs. 33%, p=0.12) and treatment (26% vs. 45%, p=0.07), and were more afraid of asking doctors questions (21% vs. 4%, p=0.01) than controls.
0	32174	patient-held record group patients were no better prepared for hospital discharge than control group patients, and both groups were ill-informed about services and benefits that might have helped after discharge from hospital.  
0	32174	Conclusions Stroke patients received poor information and explanations regardless of whether they received a patient-held record.
0	32174	A patient-held record did not appear to improve patient satisfaction or discharge planning, and may have reduced opportunities for communication and explanation.
0	4331948	Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of bee venom pharmacopuncture (bee venom pharmacopuncture) therapy according to the methods used to treat knee osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis): intra-acupoint combined with intra-articular injection, intra-acupoint injection, and intra-articular injection.  
0	4331948	Methods: A total of 69 patients were recruited by the Department of Acupuncture & Moxibustion at Dong- Eui Oriental University Hospital from February 1 to July 23, 2012.
0	4331948	The patients were assigned to 3 groups: the first group with intra-acupoint combined with intraarticular bee venom pharmacopuncture Injection (the experimental group), the 2nd group with intra-acupoint bee venom pharmacopuncture injection (control groupⅠ), and the 3rd group with intra-articular bee venom pharmacopuncture injection (control groupⅡ).
0	4331948	The participants were assigned in the order in which they were recruited.
0	4331948	Treatments were done twice a week, for a total of 9 times.
0	4331948	The effectiveness was assessed by using the visual analouge scale (visual analouge scale) and the Korea Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (KWOMAC).  
0	4331948	Results: All three groups exhibited significant visual analouge scale and KWOMAC effects.
0	4331948	Moreover, the 4 week follow-up after the final treatment showed a persistence of bee venom pharmacopuncture effects.
0	4331948	However, when the groups were compared, no statistically significant differences in visual analouge scale and KWOMAC were noted, but when improvement was considered, the results showed that intra-articular injection was more effective than intra-acupoint injection.
0	4331948	Especially, intra-acupoint combined with intra-articular injection was the most effective among the three treatments.  
0	4331948	Conclusions: Combining intra-acupoint with intraarticular injection, depending on the patient's symptoms, may produce better results when conservatively treating knee osteoarthritis.
0	2699657	Introduction: Psychosis (delusions and/or hallucinations) is a well-recognized complication of treatment of Parkinson’s disease (Parkinson’s disease).
0	2699657	Quetiapine is a currently favored treatment, but data on its efficacy are equivocal.
0	2699657	This trial aimed to provide further evidence on the efficacy of quetiapine in Parkinson’s disease psychosis.  
0	2699657	Methods: We conducted a 12 week double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.
0	2699657	Time to dropout due to lack of improvement of psychosis was the primary outcome measure.
0	2699657	Other important secondary outcomes were evaluated using standard rating scales for Parkinson’s disease and psychiatric symptoms.  
0	2699657	Results: Twenty-four eligible subjects gave consent.
0	2699657	The primary outcome, time to dropout, was examined using survival analysis.
0	2699657	It was shown that patients in the quetiapine group dropped out earlier than those in the placebo group, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.68).
0	2699657	No significant changes were found for any of the secondary outcome measures in either group.  
0	2699657	Conclusions: In this study, quetiapine at doses of up to 150 mg/day failed to significantly improve psychosis compared to placebo, however the small sample size does not allow any conclusive interpretation of the results.
0	2699657	Quetiapine did not appear to worsen Parkinson’s disease motor functioning, but its use was limited by a faster drop out compared with placebo.
0	2699657	Significant impediments were difficulty with recruitment and natural fluctuation in symptoms during the trial.
0	547907	Background Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors are effective in the treatment of OCD, many patients fail to respond to these agents.
0	547907	Growing evidence from open-label and placebo-controlled trials suggests a role for augmentation of SRIs with atypical antipsychotics in OCD.
0	547907	Quetiapine is generally well tolerated and previous open-label data has produced mixed results in OCD and additional controlled data is needed.  
0	547907	Methods We undertook a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine augmentation in subjects who had responded inadequately to open-label treatment with an SRI for 12 weeks.
0	547907	Following informed consent and screening, forty-two subjects were randomised to either placebo or quetiapine for six weeks.  
0	547907	Results There was significant improvement from baseline to endpoint on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale in both the quetiapine and placebo groups (quetiapine, n = 20, p < 0.0001; placebo, n = 21, p = 0.001) with 40% (n = 8) of quetiapine and 47.6% (n = 10) of placebo treated subjects being classified as responders.
0	547907	Quetiapine did not demonstrate a significant benefit over placebo at the end of the six-week treatment period (p = .636).
0	547907	Similarly quetiapine failed to separate from placebo in the subgroup of subjects (n = 10) with co-morbid tics.
0	547907	Quetiapine was generally well tolerated.  
0	547907	Conclusions In this study, quetiapine augmentation was no more effective than placebo augmentation of SRIs.
0	547907	A number of limitations in study design make comparisons with previous studies in this area difficult and probably contributed to our negative findings.
0	547907	Future work in this important clinical area should address these limitations.
0	30713	Background: Routine turning of critically ill patients is a standard of care.
0	30713	In recent years, specialized beds that provide automated turning have been introduced.
0	30713	These beds have been reported to improve lung function, reduce hospital-acquired pneumonia, and facilitate secretion removal.
0	30713	This trial was designed to measure the physiological effects of routine turning and respiratory therapy in comparison with continuous lateral rotation (continuous lateral rotation).  
0	30713	Methods: The study was a prospective, quasi-experimental, random assignment, trial with patients serving as their own controls.
0	30713	Paralyzed, sedated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were eligible for study.
0	30713	Patients were randomized to receive four turning and secretion management regimens in random sequence for 6 h each over a period of 24 h: (1) routine turning every 2 h from the left to right lateral position; (2) routine turning every 2 h from the left to right lateral position including a 15-min period of manual percussion and postural drainage (percussion and postural drainage); (3) continuous lateral rotation with a specialized bed that turned patients from left to right lateral position, pausing at each position for 2 min; and (4) continuous lateral rotation with a specialized bed that turned patients from left to right lateral position pausing at each position for 2 min, and a 15-min period of percussion provided by the pneumatic cushions of the bed every 2 h.  Results: Nineteen patients were entered into the study.
0	30713	There were no statistically significant differences in the measured cardiorespiratory variables.
0	30713	There was a tendency for the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO2/FIO2) to increase (174 ± 31 versus 188 ± 36; P = 0.068) and for the ratio of deadspace to tidal volume (Vd/Vt) to decrease (0.62 ± 0.18 versus 0.59 ± 0.18; P = 0.19) during periods of continuous lateral rotation, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance.
0	30713	There were statistically significant increases in sputum volume during the periods of continuous lateral rotation.
0	30713	The addition of percussion and postural drainage did not increase sputum volume for the group as a whole.
0	30713	However, in the four patients producing more than 40 ml of sputum per day, percussion and postural drainage increased sputum volume significantly.
0	30713	The number of patient turns increased from one every 2 h to one every 10 min during continuous lateral rotation.  
0	30713	Conclusion: The acute effects of continuous lateral rotation are undoubtedly different in other patient populations (spinal cord injury and unilateral lung injury).
0	30713	The link between acute physiological changes and improved outcomes associated with continuous lateral rotation remain to be determined.
0	3828218	Objective To determine the effects of combined aerobic and resistance exercise training during the second half of pregnancy on endothelial NOS expression (endothelial NOS expression), nitric oxide (nitric oxide) production and oxygen metabolism in human placenta.  
0	3828218	Methods The study included 20 nulliparous in gestational week 16–20, attending prenatal care at three tertiary hospitals in Colombia who were randomly assigned into one of two groups: The exercise group (n = 10) took part in an exercise session three times a week for 12 weeks which consisted of: aerobic exercise at an intensity of 55–75% of their maximum heart rate for 60 min and 25 mins.
0	3828218	Resistance exercise included 5 exercise groups circuit training (50 repetitions of each) using barbells (1–3 kg/exercise) and low-to-medium resistance bands.
0	3828218	The control group (n = 10) undertook their usual physical activity.
0	3828218	Mitochondrial and cytosol fractions were isolated from human placental tissue by differential centrifugation.
0	3828218	A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure nitric oxide production in cytosolic samples from placental tissue and Western Blot technique to determine endothelial NOS expression expression.
0	3828218	Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide were measured to determine oxygen metabolism.  
0	3828218	Results Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training during pregnancy leads to a 2-fold increase in endothelial NOS expression expression and 4-fold increase in nitric oxide production in placental cytosol (p = 0.05).
0	3828218	Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide production rate were decreased by 8% and 37% respectively in the placental mitochondria of exercising women (p = 0.05).  
0	3828218	Conclusion Regular exercise training during the second half of pregnancy increases endothelial NOS expression expression and nitric oxide production and decreases reactive oxygen species generation in human placenta.
0	3828218	Collectively, these data demonstrate that chronic exercise increases eNOS/NO production, presumably by increasing endothelial shear stress.
0	3828218	This adaptation may contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on the vascular and antioxidant system and in turn reduce the risk of preeclampsia, diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy.
0	5984017	Background Intravenous regional anesthesia (Intravenous regional anesthesia) is an ideal technique for short surgery on the distal extremities.
0	5984017	Different additives have been used to improve lidocaine’s block quality.  
0	5984017	Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adding dexamethasone to lidocaine on improving the quality of Intravenous regional anesthesia.  
0	5984017	Methods This study is a prospective, double-blind randomized study which was done on patients with upper extremity injuries of the distal elbow in Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas from October 2014 to December 2015.
0	5984017	A total of 110 patients aged 15 to 65 years, with ASA class I and II, with orthopedic injuries distal to the elbow, were randomly divided into two groups.
0	5984017	The control group (L) and the intervention group (L+D) received a 40-ml solution of 3 mg/kg lidocaine, and 3 mg/kg lidocaine + 8 mg of dexamethasone respectively.
0	5984017	The two groups were compared in terms of onset and recovery time of sensory block in each of the dermatome nerves classified as radial, ulnar, and median, vital signs, patient satisfaction, intraoperative opioid consumption, and request for the first postoperative opioid.  
0	5984017	Results There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics.
0	5984017	Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in the L + D group (100.39±14.6 mmHg) in comparison to the L group (90.50±11 mmHg) (p=0.002).
0	5984017	Need for opioid was reported in 20 (35.7%) patients in the L + D group in comparison to 17 (31.5%) in the L group (p=0.639).
0	5984017	The average intraoperative dose of fentanyl was 95±32.04 mcg and 88.44±18.77 mg in L + D and L groups respectively and there was no significant difference between the two groups in this respect (p=0.479).
0	5984017	In addition, the average dose of pethidine administered in the recovery room for L + D group (19.34±15.22) mg was significantly higher than in the L group (9.44±12.26 mg) (p=0.001).  
0	5984017	Conclusions Adding 8 mg dexamethasone to lidocaine has no effect on Intravenous regional anesthesia solution in upper extremity orthopedic operations and also increases postoperative opioid consumption.

0	4563922	Backgrounds Fluctuation in glycemia due to hormonal changes, growth periods, physical activity, and emotions make diabetes management difficult during adolescence.
0	4563922	Our objective was to show that a close control of patients’ self-management of diabetes by nurse-counseling could probably improve metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.  
0	4563922	Methods We designed a multicenter, randomized controlled, parallel group, clinical trial.
0	4563922	Seventy seven adolescents aged 12–17 years with A1C >8 % were assigned to either an intervention group (pediatrician visit every 3 months + nurse visit and phone calls) or to the control group (pediatrician visit every 3 months).
0	4563922	The primary outcome was the evolution of the rate of A1C during the 12 months of follow-up.
0	4563922	Secondary outcomes include patient’s acceptance of the disease (evaluated by visual analog scale), the number of hypoglycemic or ketoacidosis episodes requiring hospitalization, and evaluation of A1C rate over time in each group.  
0	4563922	Results Seventy-seven patients were enrolled by 10 clinical centers.
0	4563922	Seventy (89.6 %) completed the study, the evolution of A1C and participants satisfaction over the follow-up period was not significantly influenced by the nurse intervention.  
0	4563922	Conclusion Nurse-led intervention to improve A1C did not show a significant benefit in adolescents with type 1 diabetes because of lack of power.

0	3610917	Background Cognitive training (Cognitive training) is effective at improving cognitive outcomes in children with and without clinical impairment as well as older individuals.
0	3610917	Yet whether Cognitive training is of any preventative health benefit to working age adults is controversial.
0	3610917	Our objective was therefore to investigate the real-world efficacy of Cognitive training in the workplace, involving employees from across the working-age spectrum and addressing many of the design issues that have limited trials to date.  
0	3610917	Methods and Findings 135 white collar employees of a large Australian public sector organization were randomised to either 16 weeks (20 minutes three times per week) of online Cognitive training or an active control (active control) program of equal length and structure.
0	3610917	Cognitive, wellbeing and productivity outcome measures were analysed across three timepoints: baseline, immediately after training and 6 months post-training.
0	3610917	Cognitive training effects on cognitive outcomes were limited, even after planned subgroup analyses of cognitive capacity and age.
0	3610917	Unexpectedly, we found that our active control condition, which comprised viewing short documentaries about the natural world, had more impact.
0	3610917	Compared to the Cognitive training group, 6 months after the end of training, those in the active control group experienced a significant increase in their self-reported Quality of Life (Effect Size g = .34 vs −.15; TIME×GROUP p = .003), decrease in stress levels (g = .22 vs −.19; TIME x GROUP p = .03), and overall improvement in Psychological Wellbeing (g = .32 vs −.06; TIME×GROUP p = .02).  
0	3610917	Conclusions Cognitive training does not appear to positively impact cognition or wellbeing amongst white collar office workers; however, short time-out respite activities may have value in the promotion of psychological wellbeing.
0	3610917	Given looming challenges to workplace productivity, further work-based interventional research targeting employee mental health is recommended.

0	5799388	A fixed-dose combination tablet of benazepril and pimobendan (Fortekor Plus; Elanco Animal Health) was tested in dogs with congestive heart failure (congestive heart failure) caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (myxomatous mitral valve disease) in a three-arm, masked, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial in Japan.
0	5799388	The test group (n = 34) received Fortekor Plus twice daily.
0	5799388	Two control groups received registered formulations of benazepril (Fortekor; Elanco Animal Health) and pimobendan (Vetmedin; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica) with administration of Vetmedin twice daily and Fortekor twice (Control I, n = 14) or once (Control II, n = 19) daily.
0	5799388	Diuretics were used in 22 dogs (32.8%).
0	5799388	Global clinical scores decreased significantly from baseline in all groups; there were no significant differences between groups, and non-inferiority of Fortekor Plus compared to Control I, Control II, and combined Control I + II groups was demonstrated.
0	5799388	There were no significant differences between groups for relevant clinical chemistry and hematology variables or frequency of all adverse events.
0	5799388	Frequency of emesis was significantly (p = 0.0042) lower in the Fortekor Plus (8.8%) group than in the Control I + II (39.4%) group.
0	5799388	In conclusion, Fortekor Plus had non-inferior efficacy and was associated with significantly less emesis compared to Fortekor and Vetmedin in dogs with congestive heart failure caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease.
0	5804062	Background This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  
0	5804062	Methods Adult Korean patients with essential hypertension and a baseline mean sitting clinic systolic blood pressure (sitting clinic systolic blood pressure) ≥150 and ≤180 mmHg were randomized to 6-week treatment with placebo (n = 65), azilsartan medoxomil (azilsartan medoxomil) 40 mg (n = 132), or azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg (n = 131).
0	5804062	The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in trough sitting clinic systolic blood pressure.  
0	5804062	Results The least-squares mean (standard error) change from baseline in trough sitting clinic systolic blood pressure in the placebo, azilsartan medoxomil 40-mg, and 80-mg groups at week 6 were − 8.8 (2.00), − 22.1 (1.41), and − 23.7 (1.40) mmHg, respectively (p < 0.001 for azilsartan medoxomil 40 and 80 mg vs placebo).
0	5804062	No clinically meaningful heterogeneity in efficacy was observed between subgroups (age, sex, diabetes status) and the overall population.
0	5804062	Treatments were well tolerated and adverse events were similar between groups.  
0	5804062	Conclusions Results of this study confirm a positive benefit-risk profile of azilsartan medoxomil for essential hypertension in Korean adults.

0	4885151	Objective Many studies have supported the role of protein kinase C (protein kinase C) inhibitors in the physiopathology and treatment of bipolar disorder in adults.
0	4885151	Tamoxifen is one of the drugs with the effect of protein kinase C inhibition.
0	4885151	This study aimed to determine the effect of tamoxifen on the rate of improvement mania symptoms in the sample of children and adolescents with acute mania.  
0	4885151	Materials & Methods In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial study, registered in www.irct.ir with the code of IRCT201410126418N3, overall 44 patients with bipolar disorder with acute manic episode were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups.
0	4885151	The serum levels of lithium and tamoxifen among the participants in the treatment groups were 0.8 -1.1 mg and 20-40 mg per day respectively.
0	4885151	Serum level of lithium among participants in the control group was similar.
0	4885151	The main comparisons were made based on the Young Mania Rating Scale (Young Mania Rating Scale) and Children Depression Inventory (Children Depression Inventory) scores of the participants at baseline and at the end of each study week.
0	4885151	The pharmacological side effects of serum level of lithium were examined weekly.
0	4885151	Analysis of Covariance(ANCOVA) test was used for the statistical analysis.  
0	4885151	Results There was no difference in the baseline score of Young Mania Rating Scale and Children Depression Inventory in the treatment and control groups while a statistical significant difference (P < 0.05) in these scores was found between and within the groups.  
0	4885151	Conclusion The addition of tamoxifen to lithium causes a significant difference in reducing the symptoms of mania and depression in the treatment group compared to the control group.
0	5985892	AIM: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Methotrexate (Methotrexate) alone and combined therapy with Etanercept (Etanercept) and Methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis).  
0	5985892	METHODS: In the randomised control study, conducted in the period from March 2014 until March 2016, we evaluated the efficacy of the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with Methotrexate as monotherapy and combination treatment with Methotrexate and Etanercept.
0	5985892	In the Clinic of Rheumatology in Prishtina, 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated in combination with Etanercept (doses of 50 mg subcutaneously/weekly), with oral Methotrexate (doses up to 20 mg weekly), and Methotrexate alone (doses up to 20 mg weekly) during this period of two years.
0	5985892	Clinical response was assessed using European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (/American College of Rheumatology) Criteria and the Disease Activity Score (DAS28).
0	5985892	Radiographic changes were measured in the beginning and at the end of the study using Larsen’s method.  
0	5985892	RESULTS: Of the cohort groups of 90 patients, mean age of 55.63, 15 patients, (16.6 %) were treated with combined therapy (Etanercept plus Methotrexate) and 75 patients (83.3%) with monotherapy (Methotrexate).
0	5985892	After two years of treatment the group with combined therapy resulted with improvement of acute phase reactants as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) for the first hour (41.1 vs. 10.3 mm/hour) and C - reactive protein (C - reactive protein) (40.8 vs. 6 mg/liter), and compared to the group treated with monotherapy, there were no significant changes (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 45.7 vs 34.3 mm/hour; C - reactive protein: 48 vs 24 mg/liter).
0	5985892	Before the treatment, the severity of the disease was high, wherein the group with combined therapy DAS28 was 5.32, compared to the monotherapy group whom DAS28 was 5.90.
0	5985892	After 2 years of treatment, we had significant changes in the results of DAS28, wherein the group treated with Etanercept plus Methotrexate DAS28 was 2.12 ± 0.15, while in the group of patients treated with Methotrexate DAS28 were 3.75 ± 0.39 (t = 13.03; df = 58; p < 0.0001).
0	5985892	The group with combined therapy showed no evidence of radiographic progression comparing to the group of patients with monotherapy.  
0	5985892	CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results achieved during 2 years we can conclude that Etanercept in combination with Methotrexate reduced disease activity, slowed radiographic progression and improved clinical manifestations more effectively than Methotrexate alone.
0	5985892	No serious adverse events were noticed in the group with combination treatment.
0	5801253	Introduction Ultrasonic tissue characterization of the carotid wall using gray-scale median (gray-scale median) reflects its composition and low-GSM plaque is considered to be unstable.
0	5801253	The present study evaluated the effect of alogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, on the longitudinal change in gray-scale median, an index of the tissue characteristics of the carotid wall, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).  
0	5801253	Methods This is a post hoc subanalysis using data obtained from the SPEAD-A trial, a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the beneficial effect of alogliptin treatment on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness in patients with T2DM with no past history of apparent cardiovascular disease.
0	5801253	A total of 322 subjects (161 in the alogliptin treatment group and 161 in the conventional treatment group) were enrolled.
0	5801253	The primary outcome was the change from baseline in mean GSM-CCA (common carotid artery) during the 104-week observation period.  
0	5801253	Results Both alogliptin treatment and conventional treatment significantly increased the mean GSM-CCA (from 60.7 ± 12.3 to 65.9 ± 10.1, p < 0.001 and 58.8 ± 14.4–65.2 ± 12.2, p < 0.001, respectively) and there was no significant difference in changes in mean GSM-CCA between the treatment groups (p = 0.95).
0	5801253	Additionally, there were no differences in the changes in the left and right GSM-CCA between the groups.  
0	5801253	Conclusions A post hoc subanalysis revealed an improvement of tissue characteristics in the carotid arterial wall in both the alogliptin treatment group and the conventional treatment group during the 104-week treatment period and that there was no significant difference between the treatment groups.

0	3691733	Background Blood transfusions are common in cardiac surgery, but have been associated with increased morbidity and long-term mortality.
0	3691733	Efforts to reduce blood product use during cardiac surgery include fluid restriction to minimize hemodilution, and protocols to guide transfusion decisions.
0	3691733	INVOS is a modality that monitors brain tissue oxygen saturation, and could be useful in guiding decisions to transfuse.
0	3691733	However, the role of INVOS (brain tissue oxygen saturation) as part of an algorithm to direct blood transfusions during cardiac surgery has not been evaluated.
0	3691733	This study was conducted to investigate the value of INVOS as part of a protocol for blood transfusions during cardiac surgery.  
0	3691733	Methods Prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial, on 150 (75 per group) elective cardiac surgery patients.
0	3691733	The study was approved by the Institution Ethics committee and all patients gave written informed consent.
0	3691733	Data were initially analyzed based on “intention to treat”, but subsequently were also analyzed “per protocol”.  
0	3691733	Results When protocol was strictly followed (“per protocol analysis”), compared to the control group, significantly fewer patients monitored with INVOS received any blood transfusions (46 of 70 patients in INVOS group vs. 55 of 67 patients in the control group, p = 0.029).
0	3691733	Similarly, patients monitored with INVOS received significantly fewer units of red blood cell transfusions intraoperatively (0.20 ± 0.50 vs. 0.52 ± 0.88, p = 0.008) and overall during hospital stay (1.31 ± 1.20 vs. 1.82 ± 1.46, p = 0.024).
0	3691733	When data from all patients (including patient with protocol violation) were analyzed together (“intention to treat analysis”), the observed reduction of blood transfusions in the INVOS group was still significant (51 of 75 patients transfused in the INVOS group vs. 63 of 75 patients transfused in the control group, p = 0.021), but the overall number of units transfused per patient did not differ significantly between the groups (1.55 ± 1.97 vs. 1.84 ± 1.41, p = 0.288).  
0	3691733	Conclusions Our data suggest that INVOS could be a useful tool as part of an algorithm to guide decisions for blood transfusion in cardiac surgery.
0	3691733	Additional data from rigorous, well designed studies are needed to further evaluate the role of INVOS in guiding blood transfusions in cardiac surgery, and circumvent the limitations of this study.

0	3169982	Background: The vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab (bevacizumab) given in combination with interferon-α-2a (interferon-α-2a), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) sunitinib (sunitinib) and pazopanib (pazopanib), have all shown significant increase in progression-free survival (progression-free survival) in first-line metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (metastatic renal-cell carcinoma) therapy.
0	3169982	These targeted therapies are currently competing to be primary choice; hence, in the absence of direct head-to-head comparison, there is a need for valid indirect comparison assessment.  
0	3169982	Methods: Standard indirect comparison methods were applied to independent review progression-free survival data of the pivotal Phase III trials, to determine indirect treatment comparison hazard-ratios (hazard-ratios) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
0	3169982	As BEV+IFN and sunitinib have been compared to interferon-α-2a, indirect comparison was enabled by the common interferon-α-2a comparator arms.
0	3169982	As pazopanib was compared to placebo (placebo), a connector trial (interferon-α-2a vs placebo) was required for the indirect comparison to BEV+IFN.
0	3169982	Sensitivity analyses taking into account real-life influence of patient compliance on clinical outcomes were performed.  
0	3169982	Results: The indirect efficacy comparison resulted in a statistically nonsignificant progression-free survival difference of BEV+IFN vs sunitinib (hazard-ratios: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.78–1.45; P = 0.73) and of BEV+IFN vs pazopanib (range based on different connector trials; hazard-ratios: 0.74–1.03; P = 0.34–0.92).
0	3169982	Simulating real-life patient compliance and its effectiveness impact showed an increased tendency towards BEV+IFN without reaching statistical significance.  
0	3169982	Conclusions: There is no statistically significant progression-free survival difference between BEV+IFN and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in first-line metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.
0	3169982	These findings imply that additional treatment decision criteria such as tolerability and therapy sequencing need to be considered to guide treatment decisions.
0	554761	Background Chronic smoking is the main risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
0	554761	Knowledge on the response to the initial smoke exposures might enhance the understanding of changes due to chronic smoking, since repetitive acute smoke effects may cumulate and lead to irreversible lung damage.  
0	554761	Methods We investigated acute effects of smoking on inflammation in 16 healthy intermittent smokers in an open randomised cross-over study.
0	554761	We compared effects of smoking of two cigarettes on inflammatory markers in exhaled air, induced sputum, blood and urine at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 192 hours and outcomes without smoking.
0	554761	All sputum and blood parameters were log transformed and analysed using a linear mixed effect model.  
0	554761	Results Significant findings were: Smoking increased exhaled carbon monoxide between 0 and 1 hour, and induced a greater decrease in blood eosinophils and sputum lymphocytes between 0 and 3 hours compared to non-smoking.
0	554761	Compared to non-smoking, smoking induced a greater interleukin-8 release from stimulated blood cells between 0 and 3 hours, and a greater increase in sputum lymphocytes and neutrophils between 3 and 12 hours.  
0	554761	Conclusion We conclude that besides an increase in inflammation, as known from chronic smoking, there is also a suppressive effect of smoking two cigarettes on particular inflammatory parameters.
0	4511432	Background Overweight and obesity during pregnancy is common, although robust evidence about the economic implications of providing an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention for women who are overweight or obese is lacking.
0	4511432	We conducted a health economic evaluation in parallel with the LIMIT randomised trial.
0	4511432	Women with a singleton pregnancy, between 10+0-20+0 weeks, and BMI ≥25 kg/m2 were randomised to Lifestyle Advice (a comprehensive antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention) or Standard Care.
0	4511432	The economic evaluation took the perspective of the health care system and its patients, and compared costs encountered from the additional use of resources from time of randomisation until six weeks postpartum.
0	4511432	Increments in health outcomes for both the woman and infant were considered in the cost-effectiveness analysis.
0	4511432	Mean costs and effects in the treatment groups allocated at randomisation were compared, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (incremental cost effectiveness ratios) and confidence intervals (95%) calculated.
0	4511432	Bootstrapping was used to confirm the estimated confidence intervals, and to generate acceptability curves representing the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at alternative monetary equivalent values for the outcomes avoiding high infant birth weight, and respiratory distress syndrome.
0	4511432	Analyses utilised intention to treat principles.  
0	4511432	Results Overall, the increase in mean costs associated with providing the intervention was offset by savings associated with improved immediate neonatal outcomes, rendering the intervention cost neutral (Lifestyle Advice Group $11261.19±$14573.97 versus Standard Care Group $11306.70±$14562.02; p=0.094).
0	4511432	Using a monetary value of $20,000 as a threshold value for avoiding an additional infant with birth weight above 4 kg, the probability that the antenatal intervention is cost-effective is 0.85, which increases to 0.95 when the threshold monetary value increases to $45,000.  
0	4511432	Conclusions Providing an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention for pregnant women who are overweight or obese is not associated with increased costs or cost savings, but is associated with a high probability of cost effectiveness.
0	4511432	Ongoing participant follow-up into childhood is required to determine the medium to long-term impact of the observed, short-term endpoints, to more accurately estimate the value of the intervention on risk of obesity, and associated costs and health outcomes.

0	3611069	Background 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and droperidol were used for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting).
0	3611069	Recently, neurokinin-1 (neurokinin-1) antagonist has been used for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.
0	3611069	We evaluated the effect of oral aprepitant premedication in addition to ondansetron.  
0	3611069	Methods A total 90 patients scheduled for elective rhinolaryngological surgery were allocated to three groups (Control, Ap80, Ap125), each of 30 at random.
0	3611069	Ondansetron 4 mg was injected intravenously to all patients just before the end of surgery.
0	3611069	On the morning of surgery, 80 mg and 125 mg aprepitant were additionally administered into the Ap80 group and Ap125 group, respectively.
0	3611069	The rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching (rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching) was checked at 6 hr and 24 hr after surgery.  
0	3611069	Results Twelve patients who used steroids unexpectedly were excluded.
0	3611069	Finally 78 patients (control : Ap80 : Ap125 = 24 : 28 : 26) were enrolled.
0	3611069	Overall prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting occurrence rate of Ap125 group (1/26, 3.9%) was lower (P = 0.015) than the control group (7/24, 29.2%) at 6 hr after surgery.
0	3611069	The nausea distress score of Ap125 group (0.04 ± 0.20) was lower (P = 0.032) than the control group (0.67 ± 1.24) at 6 hr after surgery.
0	3611069	No evident side effect of aprepitant was observed.  
0	3611069	Conclusions Oral aprepitant 125 mg can be used as combination therapy for the prevention of prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.
0	5752792	Background: N-acetyl cysteine (N-acetyl cysteine) is a powerful antioxidant and has been used extensively in the treatment of paracetamol overdose with great success.
0	5752792	Aluminum phosphide (Aluminum phosphide) ingestion results in significant oxidative stress.
0	5752792	In this study, we evaluated the effects of N-acetyl cysteine on mortality in patients with severe Aluminum phosphide poisoning.  
0	5752792	Subjects and Methods: This prospective intervention study was carried out in the emergency medical unit attached to the Nehru Hospital at PGIMER, Chandigarh, over a period of 1 year.
0	5752792	All the patients presenting with severe Aluminum phosphide poisoning were randomized into two group.
0	5752792	The treatment group received N-acetyl cysteine in the dose of 150 mg/kg intravenous over 1 h, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 h, followed by 100 mg/kg 16 h in 5% dextrose.
0	5752792	The placebo group received 5% dextrose.
0	5752792	The primary end point was mortality.  
0	5752792	Results: A total of 50 patients were recruited.
0	5752792	The baseline parameters were comparable in both groups.
0	5752792	The survivors in the treatment group received 19 g of N-acetyl cysteine, but the nonsurvivors received only 12.15 g of N-acetyl cysteine.
0	5752792	The overall mortality in the study group was 88% with 87.5% mortality in the treatment group and 88.5% in the placebo group.  
0	5752792	Conclusions: Antioxidant therapy in the form of N-acetyl cysteine in severe Aluminum phosphide poisoning did not confer any survival benefit.
0	5043643	Background: Acutely elevated cortisol levels in healthy humans impair autobiographical memory recall and alter hemodynamic responses of the amygdala to emotionally valenced stimuli.
0	5043643	It is hypothesized that the effects of the cortisol on cognition are influenced by the ratio of mineralocorticoid receptor to glucocorticoid receptor occupation.
0	5043643	The current study examined the effects of acutely blocking mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors separately on 2 processes known to be affected by altering levels of cortisol: the specificity of autobiographical memory recall, and the amygdala hemodynamic response to sad and happy faces.  
0	5043643	Methods: We employed a within-subjects design in which 10 healthy male participants received placebo, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (600mg) alone, and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (600mg) alone in a randomized, counter-balanced order separated by 1-week drug-free periods.  
0	5043643	Results: On autobiographical memory testing, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism impaired, while glucocorticoid receptor antagonism improved, recall relative to placebo, as evinced by changes in the percent of specific memories recalled.
0	5043643	During fMRI, the amygdala hemodynamic response to masked sad faces was greater under both mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor antagonism relative to placebo, while the response to masked happy faces was attenuated only during mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism relative to placebo.  
0	5043643	Conclusions: These data suggest both mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor antagonism (and potentially any deviation from the normal physiological mineralocorticoid receptor/glucocorticoid receptor ratio achieved under the circadian pattern) enhances amygdala-based processing of sad stimuli and may shift the emotional processing bias away from the normative processing bias and towards the negative valence.
0	5043643	In contrast, autobiographical memory was enhanced by conditions of reduced glucocorticoid receptor occupancy.
0	2010104	Thirty-two adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia) were randomized to receive, from the time of diagnosis, either chemotherapy alone (C group) or chemotherapy plus Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine) (C+I group).
0	2010104	After remission induction and consolidation, chemotherapy was stopped in both groups but Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine was continued in the C+I group.
0	2010104	The overall survival of the C+I group was significantly increased (P less than 0.05).
0	2010104	There was no significant increase in the duration of first remission in the C+I group (0.05 less than P less than 0.1) nor in the time from first relapse to death (0.05 less than P less than 0.1).
0	2010104	There was no significant difference in the incidence of first or second remissions, and the time taken to enter remission did not differ significantly between the two groups.
0	2010104	Comparison with the results of other trials suggests that the use of maintenance chemotherapy in addition to immunotherapy produces longer remissions.
0	2010104	Five patients in the C group developed leukaemic central-nervous-system (CSN) involvement, in comparison with none in the C+I group.
0	2010104	CNS relapse did not produce a significant decrease in remission length (P greater than 0.1) but reduction in survival after CNS relapse was highly significant (P = 0.001).
0	2010104	These results suggest that administration of Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine from an early stage in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia may protect the CNS against leukaemic infiltration and therefore serve as a simple, innocuous form of CNS prophylaxis.
0	4733136	Introduction There are limited data from randomized controlled clinical trials on the outcomes of biologics after discontinuation of a different systemic therapy.
0	4733136	To determine the efficacy of adalimumab in patients who previously received systemic therapy (including failed therapy), we performed a pooled post hoc analysis of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) response data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  
0	4733136	Methods Patients from the M02-528, REVEAL, and CHAMPION studies who were previously exposed to systemic treatment were categorized based on their response.
0	4733136	The efficacy of adalimumab compared with placebo was analyzed at the end of the double-blind treatment period for the overall pooled intent-to-treat population (N = 1469) and subgroups that received (n = 780) or did not respond to (n = 229) previous systemic pretreatments.  
0	4733136	Results Rates for an improvement of ≥75 % from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI75 response) were significantly greater (p < 0.001) at week 16 in patients treated with adalimumab compared with patients who received placebo in the overall (72.1 vs. 8.0 %, respectively), previously treated (72.7 vs. 8.5 %), and previously failed treatment (70.4 vs. 8.1 %) groups.
0	4733136	PASI75 response rates were similar in the overall group and in patients who did not respond to methotrexate, cyclosporine, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A therapy.
0	4733136	Improvements of ≥90 or ≥100 % from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score were also higher with adalimumab vs. placebo in previously treated patients.
0	4733136	Adverse events were similar among subgroups.  
0	4733136	Conclusions Adalimumab was efficacious for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis regardless of prior exposure to systemic therapies or failure of those prior therapies.

0	4865704	Purpose The objective of the present study was to compare different off-midline techniques in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.  
0	4865704	Methods A total of 81 patients were included in this prospective, controlled, randomized study.
0	4865704	Patients in group 1 were treated with the Limberg flap, and patients in group 2 were treated with Mutaf technique.
0	4865704	Patients were followed up for 9 months postsurgically and assessed at regular intervals.  
0	4865704	Results A total of 41 and 40 patients received surgical treatment with Limberg or Mutaf techniques, respectively.
0	4865704	The 2 groups were similar in terms of age, gender, body mass index, and Tezel pilonidal sinus classification.
0	4865704	Also, the 2 groups were comparable with regard to the frequency of preoperative discharge from the wound site, history of abscess formation, and the resultant antibiotic use.
0	4865704	Early results showed similar recurrence rates and surgical-site complications between the 2 groups.
0	4865704	Although a lower visual analogue scale score was found in group 2 at postoperative day 1, seroma persistence, time to withdrawal of surgical drains, and wound healing were more prolonged.  
0	4865704	Conclusion In this study, Mutaf technique was comparable to Limberg flap in the treatment of pilonidal sinus.
0	4865704	Therefore, Mutaf technique may be offered as a viable surgical therapeutic option among off-midline closure approaches.
0	5037966	Objectives We sought to determine if a durable bilayer implant composed of trabecular metal with autologous periosteum on top would be suitable to reconstitute large osteochondral defects.
0	5037966	This design would allow for secure implant fixation, subsequent integration and remodeling.  
0	5037966	Materials and Methods Adult sheep were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 8/group): 1.
0	5037966	trabecular metal/periosteal graft (trabecular metal/periosteal graft), 2.
0	5037966	trabecular metal (trabecular metal), 3.
0	5037966	empty defect (40%/ED 39%).
0	5037966	Cartilage and bone healing were assessed macroscopically, biochemically (type II collagen, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sulfated glycosaminoglycan) and double-stranded DNA (double-stranded DNA) content) and histologically.  
0	5037966	Results At 16 weeks post-operatively, histological scores amongst treatment groups were not statistically different (trabecular metal/periosteal graft: overall 12.7, cartilage 8.6, bone 4.1; trabecular metal: overall 14.2, cartilage 9.5, bone 4.9; 40%/ED 39%: overall 13.6, cartilage 9.1, bone 4.5).
0	5037966	Metal scaffolds were incorporated into the surrounding bone, both in trabecular metal and trabecular metal/periosteal graft.
0	5037966	The sulfated glycosaminoglycan yield was lower in the neo-cartilage regions compared with the articular cartilage (articular cartilage) controls (trabecular metal/periosteal graft 20.8/AC 39.5, trabecular metal 25.6/AC 33.3, 40%/ED 39% 32.2/AC 40.2 µg sGAG/1 mg respectively), with statistical significance being achieved for the trabecular metal/periosteal graft group (p < 0.05).
0	5037966	Hypercellularity of the neo-cartilage was found in trabecular metal and 40%/ED 39%, as the double-stranded DNA content was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with contralateral articular cartilage controls (trabecular metal 126.7/AC 71.1, 40%/ED 39% 99.3/AC 62.8 ng dsDNA/1 mg).
0	5037966	The highest type II collagen content was found in neo-cartilage after trabecular metal compared with trabecular metal/periosteal graft and 40%/ED 39% (trabecular metal 60%/TMPG 40%/ED 39%).
0	5037966	Inter-treatment differences were not significant.  
0	5037966	Conclusions trabecular metal is a highly suitable material for the reconstitution of osseous defects.
0	5037966	trabecular metal enables excellent bony ingrowth and fast integration.
0	5037966	However, combined with autologous periosteum, such a biocomposite failed to promote satisfactory neo-cartilage formation.

0	5866326	Background Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with left ventricular assist devices (left ventricular assist devices) but are often hemodynamically tolerated.
0	5866326	Optimal implantable cardioverter defibrillator (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) tachy‐programming strategies in patients with LVAD have not been determined.
0	5866326	We sought to determine if an ultra‐conservative implantable cardioverter defibrillator programming strategy in patients with LVAD affects implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks.  
0	5866326	Methods and Results Adult patients with an existing implantable cardioverter defibrillator undergoing continuous flow LVAD implantation were randomized to standard implantable cardioverter defibrillator programming by their treating physician or an ultra‐conservative implantable cardioverter defibrillator programming strategy utilizing maximal allowable intervals to detection in the ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia zones with use of ATP.
0	5866326	Patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (cardiac resynchronization therapy) devices were also randomized to cardiac resynchronization therapy ON or OFF.
0	5866326	Patients were followed a minimum of 6 months.
0	5866326	The primary outcome was time to first implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock.
0	5866326	Among the 83 patients studied, we found no statistically significant difference in time to first implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock or total implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks between groups.
0	5866326	In the ultra‐conservative group 16% of patients experienced at least one shock compared with 21% in the control group (P=0.66).
0	5866326	There was no difference in mortality, arrhythmic hospitalization, or hospitalization for heart failure.
0	5866326	In the 41 patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillators fewer shocks were observed with CRT‐ON but this was not statistically significant: 10% of patients with CRT‐ON (n=21) versus 38% with CRT‐OFF (n=20) received shocks (P=0.08).  
0	5866326	Conclusions An ultra‐conservative programming strategy did not reduce implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks.
0	5866326	Programming restrictions on ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation zone therapy should be reconsidered for the LVAD population.
0	5866326	The role of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with LVAD warrants further investigation.

0	3544370	This study was designed to determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the Shi-cha capsule, a Chinese herbal formula, in the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold.
0	3544370	In our multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, patients with wind-cold type common cold received 0.6 g of Shi-cha capsule plus 0.6 g placebo (group A), 1.2 g of Shi-cha capsule (group B), or 1.2 g placebo (group C), three times daily for 3 days and followed up to 10 days.
0	3544370	The primary end point was all symptom duration.
0	3544370	The secondary end points were main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, the changes in cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score 4 days after the treatment, as well as adverse events.
0	3544370	A total of 377 patients were recruited and 360 met the inclusive criteria; 120 patients constituted each treatment group.
0	3544370	Compared with patients in group C, patients in groups A and B had significant improvement in the all symptom duration, main symptom duration, minor symptom duration, as well as change from baseline of cumulative symptom score, main symptom score, and minor symptom score at day 4.
0	3544370	The symptom durations and scores showed slight superiority of group B over group A, although these differences were not statistically significant.
0	3544370	There were no differences in adverse events.
0	3544370	The Shi-cha capsule is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with wind-cold type common cold.
0	3544370	Larger trials are required to fully assess the benefits and safety of this treatment for common cold.
0	5842532	Background Kidneys from deceased donors are being used to meet the growing need for grafts.
0	5842532	However, delayed graft function (delayed graft function) and acute rejection incidences are high, leading to adverse effects on graft outcomes.
0	5842532	Optimal induction intervention should include both renal structure injury repair and immune response suppression.
0	5842532	Mesenchymal stem cells (Mesenchymal stem cells) with potent anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and immune-modulatory properties are considered a candidate to prevent delayed graft function and acute rejection in renal transplantation.
0	5842532	Thus, this prospective multicenter paired study aimed to assess the clinical value of allogeneic Mesenchymal stem cells as induction therapy to prevent both delayed graft function and acute rejection in deceased donor renal transplantation.  
0	5842532	Methods Forty-two renal allograft recipients were recruited and divided into trial and control groups.
0	5842532	The trial group (21 cases) received 2 × 106/kg human umbilical-cord-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (umbilical-cord-derived MSCs) via the peripheral vein before renal transplantation, and 5 × 106 cells via the renal artery during the surgical procedure.
0	5842532	All recipients received standard induction therapy.
0	5842532	Incidences of delayed graft function and biopsy-proven acute rejection were recorded postoperatively and severe postoperative complications were assessed.
0	5842532	Graft and recipient survivals were also evaluated.  
0	5842532	Results Treatment with umbilical-cord-derived MSCs achieved comparable graft and recipient survivals with non-MSC treatment (P = 0.97 and 0.15, respectively).
0	5842532	No increase in postoperative complications, including delayed graft function and acute rejection, were observed (incidence of delayed graft function: 9.5% in the MSC group versus 33.3% in the non-MSC group, P = 0.13; Incidence of acute rejection: 14.3% versus 4.8%, P = 0.61).
0	5842532	Equal postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates were found between the two groups (P = 0.88).
0	5842532	All patients tolerated the Mesenchymal stem cells infusion without adverse clinical effects.
0	5842532	Additionally, a multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization assay revealed that umbilical-cord-derived MSCs administered via the renal artery were absent from the recipient’s biopsy sample.  
0	5842532	Conclusions Umbilical-cord-derived Mesenchymal stem cells can be used as clinically feasible and safe induction therapy.
0	5842532	Adequate timing and frequency of umbilical-cord-derived MSCs administration may have a significant effect on graft and recipient outcomes.

0	5735554	Background: The present study tries to compare the unintended outcomes of the Catania stent versus Xience stent in patients undergoing angioplasty.  
0	5735554	Materials and Methods: In a three month, follow-up, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 83 patients undergoing angioplasty, who met the inclusion criteria were entered into the study.
0	5735554	After randomization 43 patients were treated with the Xience stent and 40 patients with the Catania stent.
0	5735554	Stent-related outcomes such as Cardiac and Non-Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction (Myocardial Infarction), Target Lesion Revascularization (Target Lesion Revascularization), Stent Thrombosis (Stent Thrombosis), Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting), Peripheral vasculopathy, and Cerebral Vascular Accident (Cerebral Vascular Accident) were compared between the groups.  
0	5735554	Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of complications and clinical outcomes between the two treatment groups (P > 0.05).
0	5735554	The incidence of Myocardial Infarction, Target Lesion Revascularization, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting operation, peripheral vasculopathy, or Cerebral Vascular Accident was not observed in any patient and there was no statistically difference in mortality (4.7% vs. 2.5%; P = 0.527) and stent thrombosis (2.3% vs. 2.5%; P = 0.735).  
0	5735554	Conclusion: All in all, the present study could not find the significant differences between the Catania stent and Xience stent in terms of clinical outcomes during the follow-up period.
0	4753024	Background Fever is the most common complaint in pediatric medicine and its treatment is recommended in some situations.
0	4753024	Paracetamol is the most common antipyretic drug, which has serious side effects such as toxicity along with its positive effects.
0	4753024	Diclofenac is one of the strongest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs, which has received little attention as an antipyretic drug.  
0	4753024	Objectives This study was designed to compare the antipyretic effectiveness of the rectal form of Paracetamol and Diclofenac.  
0	4753024	Patients and Methods This double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 80 children aged six months to six years old.
0	4753024	One group was treated with rectal Paracetamol suppositories at 15 mg/kg dose and the other group received Diclofenac at 1 mg/kg by rectal administration (n = 40).
0	4753024	Rectal temperature was measured before and one hour after the intervention.
0	4753024	Temperature changes in the two groups were compared.  
0	4753024	Results The average rectal temperature in the Paracetamol group was 39.6 ± 1.13°C, and 39.82 ± 1.07°C in the Diclofenac group (P = 0.37).
0	4753024	The average rectal temperature, one hour after the intervention, in the Paracetamol and the Diclofenac group was 38.39 ± 0.89°C and 38.95 ± 1.09°C, respectively (P = 0.02).
0	4753024	Average temperature changes were 0.65 ± 0.17°C in the Paracetamol group and 1.73 ± 0.69°C in the Diclofenac group (P < 0.001).  
0	4753024	Conclusions In the first one hour, Diclofenac suppository is able to control the fever more efficient than Paracetamol suppositories.
0	5856865	Background Conventional radiotherapy for painful spinal metastases can be delivered with a single posterior-anterior (posterior-anterior) or two opposed anterior-posterior (APPA) fields.
0	5856865	We studied the effectiveness and toxicity of both techniques and studied whether treatment technique was predictive for abdominal and skin toxicity.  
0	5856865	Patients and methods Within the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study, 343 patients received 8 Gray in a single fraction or 24 Gray in six fractions for painful spinal metastases.
0	5856865	Treatment technique was not randomized.
0	5856865	At baseline and weekly during follow-up, patients reported pain and other physical complaints.
0	5856865	Any complaint increasing within 4 weeks after treatment was noted as a side effect.
0	5856865	Pain response was calculated according to international standards, taking into account changes in pain score and medication.
0	5856865	Repeated measurement analyses and multivariate logistic analyses were performed.  
0	5856865	Results Patients were mainly treated on the thoracic (34%) and lumbar (53%) spine and 73% received a posterior-anterior field.
0	5856865	Pain response was similar between both techniques (74%).
0	5856865	In patients treated at the thoraco-lumbar and lumbar spine, with multiple fractions, significantly more abdominal complaints were noticed.
0	5856865	In multivariate analysis, radiotherapy technique did not predict for side effects.  
0	5856865	Conclusion Conventional radiotherapy of painful spinal metastases provides limited toxicity.
0	5856865	Radiotherapy technique is not an independent predictor of abdominal and skin toxicity of irradiation.
0	3375195	Background Obesity is an urgent public health problem, yet only a few clinical trials have systematically tested the efficacy of long-term weight-loss maintenance interventions.
0	3375195	This randomized clinical trial tested the efficacy of a novel mind and body technique for weight-loss maintenance.  
0	3375195	Methods Participants were obese adults who had completed a six-month behavioral weight-loss program prior to randomization.
0	3375195	Those who successfully lost weight were randomized into either an experimental weight-loss maintenance intervention, Tapas Acupressure Technique (TAT®), or a control intervention comprised of social-support group meetings (SS) led by professional facilitators.
0	3375195	TAT combines self-applied light pressure to specific acupressure points accompanied by a prescribed sequence of mental steps.
0	3375195	Participants in both maintenance conditions attended eight group sessions over six months of active weight loss maintenance intervention, followed by an additional 6 months of no intervention.
0	3375195	The main outcome measure was change in weight from the beginning of the weight loss maintenance intervention to 12 months later.
0	3375195	Secondary outcomes were change in depression, stress, insomnia, and quality of life.
0	3375195	We used analysis of covariance as the primary analysis method.
0	3375195	Missing values were replaced using multiple imputation.  
0	3375195	Results Among 285 randomized participants, 79% were female, mean age was 56 (standard deviation (standard deviation) = 11), mean BMI at randomization was 34 (standard deviation = 5), and mean initial weight loss was 9.8 kg (standard deviation = 5).
0	3375195	In the primary outcome model, there was no significant difference in weight regain between the two arms (1.72 kg (se 0.85) weight regain for TAT and 2.96 kg (se 0.96) weight regain for SS, p < 0.097) Tests of between- arm differences for secondary outcomes were also not significant.
0	3375195	A secondary analysis showed a significant interaction between treatment and initial weight loss (p < .036), with exploratory post hoc tests showing that greater initial weight loss was associated with more weight regain for SS but less weight regain for TAT.  
0	3375195	Conclusions The primary analysis showed no significant difference in weight regain between TAT and SS, while secondary and post hoc analyses indicate direction for future research.

0	3554515	Background Prompt treatment of malaria attacks with arteminisin-based combination therapy (arteminisin-based combination therapy) is an essential tool for malaria control.
0	3554515	A new co-blister tablet of artesunate-mefloquine (artesunate-mefloquine) with 25 mg/kg mefloquine has been developed for the management of uncomplicated malaria attacks.
0	3554515	This non-inferiority randomized trial, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new formulation of artesunate-mefloquine in comparison to artemether-lumefantrine (artemether-lumefantrine) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults in Senegal.  
0	3554515	Methods The study was carried out from September to December 2010 in two health centres in Senegal.
0	3554515	The study end points included (i) PCR corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (adequate clinical and parasitological response) at day 28, (ii) adequate clinical and parasitological response at days 42 and 63, (iii) parasites and fever clearance time, (iv) incidence of adverse events and patients biological profile at day 7 using the WHO 2003 protocol for anti-malarial drug evaluation.  
0	3554515	Results Overall, 310 patients were randomized to receive either artesunate-mefloquine (n = 157) or artemether-lumefantrine (n = 153).
0	3554515	PCR corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28 was at 95.5% in the artesunate-mefloquine arm while that in the artemether-lumefantrine arm was at 96.7% (p = 0.83).
0	3554515	Therapeutic efficacy was at 98.5% in the artesunate-mefloquine arm versus 98.2% in the artemether-lumefantrine group at day 42 (p = 1).
0	3554515	At day 63, adequate clinical and parasitological response in the artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine arms was at 98.2% and 97.7%, respectively (p = 0.32).
0	3554515	The two treatments were well tolerated with similar biological profile at day 7.
0	3554515	However, dizziness was more frequent in the artesunate-mefloquine arm.  
0	3554515	Conclusion Artesunate-mefloquine (25 mg/Kg mefloquine) is efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adult patients.
0	5791546	Transcranial direct current stimulation (Transcranial direct current stimulation) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) has been shown to reduce cravings in tobacco addiction; however, results have been somewhat mixed.
0	5791546	In this study, we hypothesized that motivation to quit smoking is a critical factor of Transcranial direct current stimulation effects in smokers.
0	5791546	Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of both Transcranial direct current stimulation and motivation to quit on cigarette consumption and the relationship between these two factors.
0	5791546	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Transcranial direct current stimulation was applied once a day for 5 days.
0	5791546	Our primary outcome was the amount of cigarettes smoked per day.
0	5791546	We collected this information at baseline (d1), at the end of the treatment period (d5), 2 days later (d7) and at the 4-week follow-up (d35).
0	5791546	Visual Analog Scale (Visual Analog Scale) for motivation to quit was collected at the same time-points.
0	5791546	36 subjects (45 ± 11 years old; 24.2 ± 11.5 cigarettes daily smoked, 21 women) were randomized to receive either active or sham Transcranial direct current stimulation.
0	5791546	In our multivariate analysis, as to take into account the mediation and moderation effects of motivation to quit, we found a significant main effect of Transcranial direct current stimulation, showing that Transcranial direct current stimulation was associated with a significant reduction of cigarettes smoked per day.
0	5791546	We also showed a significant interaction effect of motivation to quit and treatment, supporting our hypothesis that Transcranial direct current stimulation effects were moderated by motivation to quit, indicating that higher levels of motivation were associated with a larger Transcranial direct current stimulation response.
0	5791546	We found that the participants' motivation to quit alone, both at baseline and at follow-up, does not explain the decrease in the average cigarette consumption.
0	5791546	Repetitive prefrontal Transcranial direct current stimulation coupled with high motivation significantly reduced cigarette consumption up to 4-weeks post-intervention.

0	3641457	Objective To identify subsets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients who are more protected from exacerbations with the use of an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 agonist (ICS/LABA) combination, compared with the use of LABA monotherapy.  
0	3641457	Design Post hoc cluster analysis of patients from two randomised clinical trials of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate) and salmeterol (salmeterol) that had primary endpoints of moderate/severe exacerbation rates.  
0	3641457	Setting Centres in North America.  
0	3641457	Participants 1543 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients were studied.  
0	3641457	Interventions salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 µg or salmeterol 50 µg, twice daily.  
0	3641457	Primary and secondary outcome measures The analysis identified clusters of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients more responsive to salmeterol/fluticasone propionate versus salmeterol with respect to the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations and compared their baseline clinical characteristics.  
0	3641457	Results Overall, salmeterol/fluticasone propionate significantly reduced the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations as compared with salmeterol alone (rate ratio (RR)=0.701, p<0.001).
0	3641457	Three-patient clusters were identified: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients receiving diuretics (RR=0.56, p<0.001); patients not receiving diuretics but with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) reversibility ≥12% (RR=0.67, p<0.001) exhibited a substantial reduction in the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations relative to salmeterol.
0	3641457	A third cluster, consisting of patients not receiving diuretics and without forced expiratory volume in 1 s reversibility, demonstrated no difference for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate versus salmeterol.
0	3641457	Patients receiving diuretics had a significantly higher prevalence of comorbid cardiovascular disease.  
0	3641457	Conclusions chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients receiving diuretics and those not receiving diuretics but with forced expiratory volume in 1 s reversibility >12% at baseline were significantly more likely to experience a reduction in COPD-associated exacerbations with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate versus salmeterol alone.

0	3685573	The breath hydrogen test was carried out to estimate the amount of unabsorbed dietary carbohydrates and the percentage of the total amount of dietary carbohydrates in the breakfast that were unabsorbed, as well as to estimate oro-cecal transit time.
0	3685573	The respiratory quotient was also measured to find the ratio of carbohydrates/lipid metabolism in the post-breakfast state.
0	3685573	Subjects’ peripheral blood glucose concentration was measured by a blood glucose meter.
0	3685573	The subjects participated under two different experimental conditions: with a usual suppertime (having supper at 18:00) and a late suppertime (having supper at 23:00).  
0	3685573	Results The efficiency of the digestion and absorption of dietary carbohydrates in the breakfast under late suppertime conditions was higher than that under usual suppertime conditions.
0	3685573	Usual or late suppertime had no effect on the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids oxidized after the subjects had breakfast.
0	3685573	There were significant differences in the blood glucose level between the two conditions at 30, 60, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after having breakfast, whereas the mean blood glucose level under late suppertime conditions was significantly higher than under usual suppertime conditions.  
0	3685573	Conclusions Having a late supper showed a worse effect on postprandial serum glucose profiles the following morning.
0	3685573	This study confirmed that keeping our usual meal timing is important for our health.
0	2899362	In a randomised clinical trial in 50 patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee, the clinical results of high tibial osteotomy (high tibial osteotomy) according to the open wedge osteotomy (open wedge osteotomy) and closed wedge osteotomy (closed wedge osteotomy) were compared.
0	2899362	In both groups locked plate fixation was used.
0	2899362	Clinical and radiological assessments were performed preoperatively and after one year.
0	2899362	Postoperative hip-knee-ankle (hip-knee-ankle) correction angles were monitored on standing leg X-rays.
0	2899362	The effect of high tibial osteotomy on collateral laxity of the knee was measured with a specially designed varus-valgus device.
0	2899362	The WOMAC osteoarthritis index, the modified knee society score (knee society score) and visual analogue scales (visual analogue scales) were used to assess symptoms of osteoarthritis, function, pain and patient satisfaction.
0	2899362	At one-year follow-up we found accurate corrections in both groups and the planned correction angles were achieved.
0	2899362	No loss of correction was observed.
0	2899362	Furthermore, the medial collateral laxity and the patellar height significantly decreased after open wedge osteotomy.
0	2899362	Significant improvements of WOMAC and knee society score scores were found in both groups.
0	2899362	All patients had significantly less pain and were very satisfied with the results.
0	2899362	Surgery time was significantly longer in the closed wedge osteotomy group, and complications were more frequent in this group.
0	2899362	Both techniques led to good and comparable clinical results.
0	2899362	The choice of whether to perform an open or a closed wedge osteotomy may be based on preoperative patellar height or concomitant collateral laxity.
0	2826098	Background: The antiestrogen tamoxifen may have partial estrogen-like effects on the postmenopausal uterus.
0	2826098	Aromatase inhibitors (Aromatase inhibitors) are increasingly used after initial tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal early breast cancer due to their mechanism of action: a potential benefit being a reduction of uterine abnormalities caused by tamoxifen.
0	2826098	Patients and methods: Sonographic uterine effects of the steroidal AI exemestane were studied in 219 women participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: a large trial in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (or unknown) early breast cancer, disease free after 2–3 years of tamoxifen, randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years adjuvant treatment.
0	2826098	The primary end point was the proportion of patients with abnormal (≥5 mm) endometrial thickness (endometrial thickness) on transvaginal ultrasound 24 months after randomisation.
0	2826098	Results: The analysis included 183 patients.
0	2826098	Two years after randomisation, the proportion of patients with abnormal endometrial thickness was significantly lower in the exemestane compared with tamoxifen arm (36% versus 62%, respectively; P = 0.004).
0	2826098	This difference emerged within 6 months of switching treatment (43.5% versus 65.2%, respectively; P = 0.01) and disappeared within 12 months of treatment completion (30.8% versus 34.7%, respectively; P = 0.67).
0	2826098	Conclusion: Switching from tamoxifen to exemestane significantly reverses endometrial thickening associated with continued tamoxifen.
0	3150344	Background Type I interferons have pleiotropic effects on host cells, including inhibiting telomerase in lymphocytes and antiviral activity.
0	3150344	We tested the hypothesis that long-term interferon treatment would result in significant reduction in average telomere length in peripheral blood T lymphocytes.  
0	3150344	Methods/Principal Findings Using a flow cytometry-based telomere length assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from the Hepatitis-C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (Hepatitis-C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis) study, we measured T cell telomere lengths at screening and at months 21 and 45 in 29 Hepatitis-C virus infected subjects.
0	3150344	These subjects had failed to achieve a sustained virologic response following 24 weeks of pegylated-interferon-alpha plus ribavirin treatment and were subsequently randomized to either a no additional therapy group or a maintenance dose pegylated-IFNα group for an additional 3.5 years.
0	3150344	Significant telomere loss in naïve T cells occurred in the first 21 months in the interferon-alpha group.
0	3150344	Telomere losses were similar in both groups during the final two years.
0	3150344	Expansion of CD8+CD45RA+CD57+ memory T cells and an inverse correlation of alanine aminotransferase levels with naïve CD8+ T cell telomere loss were observed in the control group but not in the interferon-alpha group.
0	3150344	Telomere length at screening inversely correlated with Hepatitis-C viral load and body mass index.  
0	3150344	Conclusions/Significance Sustained interferon-alpha treatment increased telomere loss in naïve T cells, and inhibited the accumulation of T cell memory expansions.
0	3150344	The durability of this effect and consequences for immune senescence need to be defined.
0	3724375	Background: Coronary artery bypass graft is one of common cardiac surgeries which unfortunately accompany with some adverse events such as delirium.
0	3724375	Proinflammatory processes play an important role in pathogenesis of post-operative delirium.
0	3724375	Therefore, the effect of dexamethasone (dexamethasone) on post-operative delirium after cardiac surgery was evaluated.  
0	3724375	Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was conducted with objective of evaluation of dexamethasone effects on post-operative deliriums and complications after cardiac surgery.
0	3724375	Ninety three eligible patients who undergone coronary arteries bypass graft was divided into two groups of dexamethasone with 43 patients and placebo (placebo) with 50 patients.
0	3724375	dexamethasone group taken 8 mg dexamethasone intra-venous before induction of anesthesia followed by 8 mg every 8 h for 3 day and other group received placebo in same way.  
0	3724375	Results: All patients assessed by Mini-mental status questionnaire and psychiatric interviewing with aim of diagnosing delirium.
0	3724375	Extubation time of dexamethasone group was significantly reduced.
0	3724375	The first post-operative day deliriums, extubation time, hospital, and intensive-care unit length of stay significantly reduced in dexamethasone group without increasing serious complications such as infectious disease.
0	3724375	After administration of dexamethasone only hyperglycemia as an adverse event was increased in dexamethasone group.
0	3724375	Other complications of renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory system did not show any significant differences between groups.  
0	3724375	Conclusion: Pre-operative administration of dexamethasone might safely protect brain of the patients who undergone cardiac surgery against post-operative delirium.
