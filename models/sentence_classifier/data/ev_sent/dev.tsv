1	4015540	The response rate of 50% reduction was 39.2% (67/171 patients; P = 0.0001 vs placebo), 37.6% (32/85), 40.7% (35/86) and 19.8% (33/167), respectively.  
1	4015540	Global impression of pain improvement was significantly favorable for duloxetine vs the placebo (P < 0.0001).   
1	4015540	Overall, the incidence of adverse events was significantly (P = 0.0153) higher in the combined duloxetine group (84.8%; 145/171 patients) than in the placebo group (73.7%; 123/167 patients).

0	4015540	Among three major complications of diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy seems to have the highest incidence, with 36.7% of diabetic patients reported to be suffering from this condition2.  
0	4015540	Duloxetine is safe, efficacious and clinically useful in the management of Diabetic neuropathic pain.
0	4015540	With regard to the incidence of each adverse events and each adverse drug reaction (adverse drug reaction), the combined duloxetine group was compared with the placebo group by Fisher's exact test.
1	4192987	The three different regimens were found to be similar in their ability to control 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone levels.
1	4192987	The difference in median was not statistically significant for serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone levels [Tables 2 and 3].  
0	4192987	A single spot sample of serum testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone do not reliably reflect the 24-hour control of the disease.
0	4192987	The regimens differed in the timing of the evening dose of hydrocortisone, 06.00-07.00 pm in regimen 1 and 09.00-10.00 pm in regimen 2.
1	4913581	Supplemented cows showed a lower risk for oxidative stress, as reflected by a lower oxidative stress index (P = .036), different areas under the curve for the concentrations of glucose (P < .01), insulin (P = .043), and nonesterified fatty acids10 (P = .041), more rapid elimination rates (P = .080, <.01 and .047 respectively), and shorter half‐lives (P = .040, <.01 and .032) of these metabolites.  
1	4913581	There was no difference between groups in maximum concentration during intravenous glucose tolerance testing (Fig 1A, P = .64) or Tbasal (P = .77) for glucose during intravenous glucose tolerance testing.
1	4913581	Similar to the changes observed in glucose, the insulin area under the curve, insulin minimum concentration, and insulin half‐life were decreased in supplemented cows.
1	4913581	Insulin secretion in response to glucose infusion (peak concentration) was not affected by treatment (Fig 1B, P = .29), but supplemented cows had more rapid insulin clearance (elimination rate) and a shorter Tbasal, requiring only 44% of the time required by nonsupplemented animals to reach basal insulin concentration after glucose infusion.
1	4913581	Supplemented cows had larger nonesterified fatty acids10 area under the curve, a faster nonesterified fatty acids10 elimination rate, and a decreased nonesterified fatty acids10 half‐life.
0	4913581	No differences between groups in the concentration of the studied analytes were found at the time of enrollment (Table 2), whereas during the intravenous glucose tolerance testing basal measurements, only the serum antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress index differed, being higher and lower, respectively, in the supplemented group (Table 2), thereby indicating a decreased risk for oxidative stress.

0	4913581	Therefore, the greater decrease in serum nonesterified fatty acids10 may not directly translate to a greater decrease in the concentration of beta‐hydroxybutyrate11.  
0	4913581	The intravenous glucose tolerance testing, however still, is considered a good method for assessing insulin resistance in cattle given its practicality and agreement with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, the gold standard test.26 The major limitation of this study was the small sample size, as there were only 5 animals per study group.
0	4913581	The dose of glucose administered during the intravenous glucose tolerance testing differed from some previous studies, which employed larger24 and smaller25 doses than used in this study.
1	2853089	The Internet group's declared uptake of the trial results was only slightly higher (47.1% vs 33.9% P=0.166); however, they understood the results significantly more accurately (18.8% vs 5.6% P=0.039).  
1	2853089	Expectations about the results were also similar in both groups: knowing whether the trial yielded useful results (82.2% P=0.633), understanding the treatment received (20.6% P=0.468), and understanding clinical trials (9.3% P=0.745).  
0	2853089	Among the patients who declared they had obtained the results via a website, 37.5% of the Internet group understood the results fairly well, which was not the case in the control group (0% P=0.262).  
0	2853089	This would be consistent with some patients' poor understanding of the results, which may have been due to confusion between information about the effectiveness of Trastuzumab in general and the specific results of the FNCLCC-PACS04 trial.
1	5446410	The prepatent period in DSM265-treated volunteers of cohort 2 compared with placebo recipients was longer (p=0·036, log-rank test).
1	5446410	The highest parasite load assessed by thick blood smear microscopy was a median of 11 parasites per μL (IQR 4–17), and did not differ significantly between placebo and DSM265 recipients (p=0·4).
0	5446410	We assessed the prophylactic activity of DSM265 against controlled human malaria infection (controlled human malaria infection).  
0	5446410	DSM265 was safe and well tolerated in this study's setting, with no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, or laboratory tests following oral dosing of 400 mg DSM265.
1	3410988	In this pilot, proof-of-principle study we hypothesized that memantine therapy would improve test scores of young adults with Down syndrome on measures of episodic and spatial memory, which are generally considered to be hippocampus dependent.
1	3410988	Although no significant differences were observed between the memantine and placebo groups on the two primary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the memantine group in one of the secondary measures associated with the primary hypothesis.
1	3410988	Given the mechanism of action of memantine and the hypothesized effects on hippocampal functioning in particular, two primary measures of episodic memory were chosen for this study: Paired Associate Learning (Paired Associate Learning) and Pattern Recognition Memory (Pattern Recognition Memory).
1	3410988	The overall recruitment and inclusion flow into the study is outlined in Figure 1.  There were no differences expected between the placebo and memantine groups on age or gender, given the matched-pair design.
1	3410988	In each group, 62% of the participants were female.
1	3410988	The mean age of the participants in the placebo group (22 years and 7 months, range 18–31) did not differ from the mean age of the participants in the memantine group (23 years and 3 months; range 18–30; t(36)=−0.552, P=0.59).
1	3410988	Parent's years of education was used to index the socioeconomic status.
1	3410988	There were no significant differences between the placebo and memantine groups on the years of education of the mothers or fathers (mother: t(36)=1.43, P=0.16; father: t(36)=−0.43, P=0.67).  
1	3410988	Additionally, significant contrast effect was found for one secondary measure of memory functioning, the California Verbal Learning Test-II Free Recall Total score (F(1, 32)=3.02, *P=0.046).
1	3410988	Pre/post difference scores on the California Verbal Learning Test-II Free Recall Total Score were 5.84 (90% CI=3.47–8.21) for the memantine group and 2.53 (90% CI=0.33–4.72) for the placebo group, showing that the memantine group scored disproportionately better than the placebo group at 16 weeks.
1	3410988	Finally, a contrast effect bordering statistical significance was found for the Differential Ability Scales-II Recall of Digits score (F(1, 34)=2.83, P=0.051).
1	3410988	The memantine pre/post difference score was 5.39 (90% CI=−3.88 to 14.66), whereas the pre/post difference score for the placebo group was −7.47 (90% CI=−16.50 to 1.55).
1	3410988	As can be seen in Figure 2b, various outcome measures had Cohen's d values approaching a moderate effect size (>0.30), and the California Verbal Learning Test-II Free Recall Total Score as well as the Differential Ability Scales-II Recall of Digits score had Cohen's d values of >0.5.  
1	3410988	There were no laboratory adverse events and no serious adverse events.
0	3410988	Additionally, we found effects with P-values <0.10 for one of the primary outcome measures, the Paired Associate Learning Stages, and for one of the secondary/discriminant outcome measures, the Differential Ability Scales-II Recall of Digits.
0	3410988	A total of 20 subjects per treatment group was expected to provide ∼60% power to detect a between-group mean difference of 1.2 patterns placed correctly on the Paired Associate Learning (first trial) with respect to change from baseline to treatment week 16.
0	3410988	In selecting the age range, our goal was to avoid the potential confound of neurodevelopment during the 16-week time window between the baseline neuropsychological evaluation and the posttreatment assessment, while also minimizing any superimposing effect of neurodegeneration on these measures.
0	3410988	This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and efficacy of memantine on the treatment of cognitive decline associated with dementia in individuals with Down syndrome.
0	3410988	BODY.RESULTS.SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF MEMANTINE. 
0	3410988	The finding of a borderline significant effect on the Differential Ability Scales-II Recall of Digits is also intriguing and deserves future investigation, because of this measure's dependence on prefrontal cortex function.  
0	3410988	The same tester examined the participant at baseline and at 16 weeks.  
0	3410988	With the exception of three participants, oral levothyroxine (to treat hypothyroidism), insulin and birth control pills were the only concomitant medications taken by the study participants.
0	3410988	We used a carefully selected set of neuropsychological outcomes to test our primary hypothesis that memantine might improve hippocampal-dependent function in individuals with Down syndrome.
0	3410988	Both of these tasks showed significant differences between participants with Down syndrome and mental-age-matched controls in the study by Pennington et al.7 Both of these tasks comprise nonverbal stimuli, are administered by computer and require only a motor response (pointing on a touch screen).
0	3410988	Specifically, the contrast effect tested whether the pre/post difference for each outcome variable was larger in the memantine group than in the placebo group.
0	3410988	(A visual representation of the raw data and the California Verbal Learning Test-II Free Recall Total Score analysis performed are depicted in graph form in Figure 2a).
0	3410988	Additionally, it is plausible to assume that, by the time treatment began, various irreversible pathological cellular cascades were already triggered and the disease process might have reached a point of no return (see Costa39 for a more complete set of comments on the MEADOWS trial).
0	3410988	Group differences in discriminant secondary measures were reported next.
1	3438438	Three months after the end of training program, experimental group showed better instructions for jogging in comparison to the control group.
1	3438438	While the amount of HbA1c (from 8.95 to 7.90 Unit?

1	3438438	In addition, before training intervention, most of internal instructions of patients for jogging in the group of intervention and control respectively included feeling exhilaration during jogging (50% and 47%), fear of blood sugar increase (38% and 34%) and fear of catching side effects of diabetes (36% and 40%).
1	3438438	But after training intervention, Chi Square test indicated a significant difference in all the internal instructions of diabetic patients for jogging (Table 3).

0	4283690	There is some evidence to suggest that the employment rate in Psoriatic arthritis patients is higher than in the rheumatoid arthritis population, but significantly lower than that seen in the general population.15 However, age of onset of Psoriatic arthritis is in the 30–40s for men and women, an age at which many patients are in the midst of their working careers.

1	4501118	The mean (SD) number of diarrhea days was lower with miglustat + S. boulardii (0.8 [2.4] days) than with miglustat + placebo (1.3 [2.4] days), but the paired treatment difference was not statistically significant (−0.5 [2.4] days; p = 0.159).
1	4501118	There were no between-treatment differences in miglustat pharmacokinetics.  
1	4501118	The mean (SD) numbers of consecutive diarrhea days were 0.5 (1.48) days with miglustat + S. boulardii and 0.9 (1.58) days with miglustat + placebo (p = 0.2189 based on Wilcoxon paired signed rank test for miglustat + S. boulardii versus miglustat + placebo).

1	4501118	There were no significant differences in miglustat Cmax, AUCτ, Tmax between the miglustat + S. boulardii and miglustat + placebo treatment periods.
0	4501118	S. boulardii produces a high amount of invertase [27, 28], and may be a good candidate because yeast-secreted sucrase cleaves sucrose at the O-C (fructose) bond [17] and is not expected to be inhibited by miglustat, which is a glucose analog.
0	4501118	There were no premature discontinuations related to gastrointestinal events.
0	4501118	Safety and tolerability were evaluated based on adverse events (adverse events), serious adverse events (serious adverse events), physical examinations, vital signs, routine hematological, biochemical and urinalysis laboratory assessments, and body weight.  
0	4501118	Secondary endpoints included the number of 'consecutive diarrhea days', the frequency and maximum severity of reported gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, bloating, belching, flatulence, indigestion/upset stomach, and/or abdominal pain rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 [none] to 4 [very severe] inclusive), the mean daily interference score for subjects with gastrointestinal events (an indication of the extent to which gastrointestinal symptoms interfered with subjects' daily activities based on a 5-point scale graded from 0 [not at all] to 4 [very much]), mean daily Bristol Stool Scores, the frequency of premature treatment discontinuations related to gastrointestinal adverse events, and the proportion of subjects unable to maintain their usual diet.  
0	4501118	Miglustat-related gastrointestinal disturbances are thought to arise from the inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases, mainly sucrase isomaltase.
1	5380326	At the end of study, the mean 25(OH)D level in vitamin D group was significantly increased and normalised.
1	5380326	There were no changes in the level of Th1/Th2 cytokines.
1	5380326	Our important finding revealed that upon correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, the serum gamma-induced protein 10 and DPP IV levels were decreased significantly as compare to the placebo group (delta changes; 83.27 vs -133.80; 95% CI [-326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125, and 271.04 vs -518.69; 95% CI [-1179,15, -59.781], p = 0.0305, respectively.
1	5380326	E  [-326.910, -40.758]; F  [-1179.15, -59.781]   After 6 weeks, the delta value of gamma-induced protein 10 level was decreased significantly in vitamin D group, as compared to the increased level in placebo group, -133.8 vs 83.27 picogram per milliliter; 95% CI [326.910, -40.758], p = 0.0125 (Table 3 and Fig 2).  
0	5380326	The link between vitamin D and gamma-induced protein 10 was previously demonstrated in an in vitro study.
0	5380326	93 patients were screened for participation in the study.
0	5380326	The dosages of ergocalciferol or vitamin D2 supplement were given according to our protocol based on the ranges of vitamin D deficiency as following: for mild deficiency (20 to less than 30 ng/mL) 60,000 unit/week, for moderate deficiency (10 to less than 20 ng/mL) 80,000 unit/week, and for severe deficiency (less than 10 ng/mL) 10,000 unit/week.
0	5380326	To prove this concept, we conducted a randomised control-trial to assess the changes in serum levels T-helper cells associated cytokines, gamma-induced protein 10 and DPP-IV, without influences driven by interferon treatment, after a short-term period for correction of vitamin D deficiency in chronic hepatitis C patients.

1	4453270	Most importantly, conditions differed on valence (F(2, 40) = 40.05, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.67) but not on arousal (F(2, 40) = 0.87, p = 0.42, ηp2 = 0.04).
1	4453270	The positive unrelated script was rated as more pleasant than the positive related and negative related scripts (both p's < 0.001), and the positive related script as more pleasant than the negative related script (p = 0.02).
1	4453270	Conditions also differed on vividness (F(2, 40) = 5.65, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.04), with the positive unrelated script being rated as most vivid (positive related: p = 0.01; negative related: p = 0.003) and no differences between the positive related and negative related conditions (p = 0.80).  
1	4453270	There was a trend for the time × condition interaction (F(2, 37) = 2.79, p = 0.07, ηp2 = 0.13), indicating increases in anxiety tended to differ across conditions (see Figure 1).
1	4453270	Posthoc analyses showed that increases in anxiety in the positive unrelated condition were greater than in the positive related and negative related conditions (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively).
1	4453270	There was a trend for the valence ratings to be higher in the positive related than in the negative related condition (t(24) = 1.95, p = 0.06).  
0	4453270	MANOVAs revealed that relative to the positive related condition, negative related (p = 0.03) and no imagery (p = 0.002) conditions showed greater heart rate decreases in response to unpleasant versus neutral pictures.
0	4453270	On the other hand, heart rate increases may be functional when one is surprised or confronted with unpredicted negative material and action is needed.
0	4453270	Participants rated their own script on vividness (How vivid was your script-induced imagery?), valence (How pleasant was the script?), and arousal (How arousing/exciting was the script?) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely).  
0	4453270	Future studies are also merited in order to enlighten the underlying working mechanisms, for example, by using a negative unrelated script or general mood inductions, or by indexing implicit and explicit memory afterwards to examine its relationship with the autonomic responses during threat.
0	4453270	A positive unrelated (positive unrelated) script was used as an extra control condition in order to distinguish mood induction and changes in attribution as explanatory factors.
0	4453270	Although, clearly, this mechanism takes place after the event has happened, possibly, creating a different stage before the event will happen will also proactively change the meaning of the event.  
0	4453270	Because of these differences, pre- to post-increases in subjective anxiety were entered in the heart rate analyses as a between-subject covariate2.
1	3411720	We found no evidence that concurrent supplementation with multi-nutrients influenced the magnitude of the effect of zinc on rates of diarrhea, respiratory illness, fever without localizing signs, or other illness (guardian-reported illness with symptoms involving skin, ears, eyes and abscesses, but excluding trauma or burns).
1	3411720	Zinc supplementation reduced the hazard rate of diarrhea by 24% (4%–40%).
1	3411720	By contrast, multi-nutrients seemed to increase this rate (HR; 95% CI: 1.19; 0.94–1.50), particularly in children with asymptomatic Giardia infection at baseline (2.03; 1.24–3.32).
1	3411720	Zinc also protected against episodes of fever without localizing signs (0.75; 0.57–0.96), but we found no evidence that it reduced the overall number of clinic visits.  
1	3411720	We found no evidence that the efficacy of zinc supplements in reducing diarrhea rates is enhanced by concurrent supplementation with other micronutrients.
0	3411720	These baseline factors included infection with Giardia intestinalis, because its role as diarrhea-causing agent is controversial: some studies reported an association with acute and persistent diarrhea, whereas others found no association, or even that Giardia infection was associated with protection against acute diarrhea [6].  
0	3411720	Iron may also influence or impair the immune responses to pathogens [17].

0	4077042	We investigated the prevalence of reflux symptoms in patients with primary insomnia and conducted a randomized multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the effects of proton pump inhibitor treatment on insomnia.
0	4077042	The patients were randomly assigned to two groups according to a computer-assisted prefixed order, and then one group took 20 mg of omeprazole and the other an indistinguishable placebo 30 min before dinner once a day for 2 weeks.
0	4077042	When sleep quality improvement after omeprazole treatment was compared between cases with and without sleep-related quality of life impairment, only those with a lower QOLRAD-J sleep-related score showed consistent improvement in sleep quality measured by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.  
1	5811944	This study was also found that the mean HbA1c dropped significantly in the home-based group (paired t test: t = 8.80, df = 23, P < 0.001), but it did not change in the hospital-based group (paired t test: t = −0.72, df = 25, P < 0.47).

1	3441280	In contrast, concentrations of the final catabolic product of adenosine 5′-triphosphate, uric acid, were significantly increased compared to placebo by ~50% after administration via proximal-release pellets (P = 0.003) and naso-duodenal tube (P = 0.001), but not after administration via distal-release pellets.  
1	3441280	Comparison of the AUC of the two types of ATP-containing pellets revealed that the proximal-release pellets caused a significantly higher increase in plasma lithium than the distal-release pellets (P = 0.001) (Figure 3).
0	3441280	Another possibility is that the negative charges on the carboxymethylcellulose molecule, which promote its exposure to water, are shielded by the sodium-ions in the adenosine 5′-triphosphate pellets, thus slowing the swelling of carboxymethylcellulose in the pellets and thereby the release of their contents.  
0	3441280	Lithium Cmax for the proximal release pellets was reached between 135 and 210 min after administration at a mean concentration of 404 ng/mL for the placebo pellets and 200 ng/mL for the adenosine 5′-triphosphate pellets.

0	5728078	In particular, metabolic syndrome (metabolic syndrome) is often accompanied by vitamin D deficiency and low levels of serum 25(OH)VitD have been associated with metabolic disturbances in this setting [8–11], though not consistently [12–15].
0	5728078	Yet, interventional studies with vitamin D supplementation have led to conflicting results, with most showing that vitamin D supplementation might not be translated into clinically meaningful changes in lipid concentrations [61, 62].
0	5728078	To explain the difference between results of observational versus interventional studies it has been suggested that these associations may be confounded by shared metabolic risk factors rather than a causal relationship.
0	5728078	We administered 2000 IU VitD/day, a higher than usual dose but within safety limits, since former studies failed to find any significant changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors when using usual vitamin D doses (400–800 IU/day).

1	5509647	Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following Paired associative stimulation.
1	5509647	Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t = −2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and globally.
1	5509647	Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by Paired associative stimulation.
1	5509647	Alcohol intoxication also resulted in impaired peak PAS-induced neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the placebo beverage, as indexed using the mean maximum cortical evoked activity ratio in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = −2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011; Fig. 3).
1	5509647	Alcohol significantly impaired mean (t = −3.051, df = 13, p = 0.009) and maximum dorsolateral prefrontal cortex PAS-induced neuroplasticity globally (t = −3.260, df = 13, p = 0.006).
0	5509647	Pharmacological isolation of NMDA receptors by antagonism of GABAA receptors via picrotoxin did not produce the complete impairment of neuroplasticity otherwise produced by alcohol in hippocampal slices.
0	5509647	However, given that theta-gamma coupling has been demonstrated to be related to working memory load, we can infer that alcohol is acting on the same neuronal networks involved in working memory to impair potentiation of theta-gamma coupling.
0	5509647	Alcohol consumption produces a number of neurochemical and neurophysiological changes in the brain.
0	5509647	A one sample t-test confirmed that potentiation occurred under the placebo condition, as the mean maximum cortical evoked activity ratio was significantly greater than 1 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 2.432, df = 13, p = 0.030) and globally (t = 2.325, df = 13, p = 0.037).Figure 3(a)
0	5509647	This novel technique holds the promise of revealing the effect of alcohol on neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and allows for the indexing theta-gamma coupling.

1	3480782	Patients (58% males; pooled median age 32 years [Interquartile range, IQR, 25–41]; pooled median symptom duration 24 months [IQR 12–72]) preferred fluticasone propionate over ciclesonide nasal spray overall (55.41% vs. 25.68%, P = 0.007) and also with respect to attributes of scent, soothing feel, and nasal irritation.
1	3480782	There was no statistically significant difference in immediate efficacy.
1	3480782	fluticasone propionate was preferred over ciclesonide with respect to scent, soothing feel and nasal irritation, and also overall.
1	3480782	Regarding sensory attributes, patient ratings favored fluticasone propionate over ciclesonide with respect to satisfying scent, soothing feel and nasal irritation.
1	3480782	Thirty seven (50%) patients preferred fluticasone propionate compared to 6 (8.11%) preferring ciclesonide with regards to satisfying scent (P < 0.001); 42 (56.76%) reported fluticasone propionate to provide a more soothing feel compared to 15 (20.27%) preferring ciclesonide in this regard (P < 0.001).
1	3480782	Only 1 (1.35%) patient reported nasal irritation following fluticasone propionate administration, in contrast to 21 (28.38%) following ciclesonide use (P = 0.002).
1	3480782	Although, only one patient (1.35%) had urge to sneeze following fluticasone propionate use, compared to 10 following ciclesonide (13.51%), this difference was not statistically significant.
1	3480782	The number reporting immediate taste, aftertaste, run down to throat and run off from nose were less with ciclesonide compared to fluticasone propionate, but these differences were also insignificant statistically.
0	3480782	We conducted a randomized, double blind, single dose, crossover study at the Otorhinolaryngology out-patient department of Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research) and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India, between December 2009 and May 2010.
0	3480782	Two tailed P-value <0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.
0	3480782	The tolerability of both preparations was good and therefore this probably has not contributed to the difference in preference.  
0	3480782	The median (interquartile range) age of the participants who received ciclesonide first was 32 (23–42) years while the median symptom duration was 24 (12–72) months.
0	3480782	Previous studies with nasal steroids have reported that patients usually prefer scentless and tasteless preparations but in our study patients preferred fluticasone that has a mild fruity odor, while ciclesonide has no odor but evokes a more irritating sensation in the nasal mucosa.
0	3480782	In our study both drugs were delivered as aqueous nasal spray formulation that allows better dispersal and is considered to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa.

1	5075282	However, participants in the bilamellar tarsal rotation group reported more pain and discomfort during the days between surgery and suture removal than the posterior lamellar tarsal rotation group (odds ratio 1·46 [95% CI 1·12–1·89]; p=0·004; table 4).
1	5075282	There was no evidence of a difference in patient satisfaction between the two groups for treatment of trichiasis (p=0·20) or the cosmetic appearance of the operated eyelid (p=0·64; table 4).  
0	5075282	Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either bilamellar tarsal rotation or posterior lamellar tarsal rotation surgery, stratified by surgeon.
0	5075282	Considerable care was taken to ensure that the surgeons did both procedures using the WHO-described method with equal precision.4 We trained surgeons who had been previously taught posterior lamellar tarsal rotation to do the bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure.
0	5075282	The best six surgeons did the surgery in this trial: they were all certified as consistently performing all component steps of both operations correctly, using the WHO certification procedures.  
0	5075282	Patients were recruited mainly through community-based screening in three districts of West Gojam Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
0	5075282	However, again we found no evidence of a difference in moderate-to-severe eyelid contour abnormality between the two groups (bilamellar tarsal rotation, 4% vs posterior lamellar tarsal rotation, 5%; relative risk ratio 0·76 [95% CI 0·41–1·44]; p=0·40).
0	5075282	Adults with trachomatous trichiasis were randomly allocated to either bilamellar tarsal rotation or posterior lamellar tarsal rotation surgery, stratified by surgeon, and followed up for 1 year.
1	4081799	Main long-term predictors for favorable course were adherence to Relapse prevention, more spontaneity, and more ineffectiveness.
1	4081799	Pairwise comparison of groups showed full completers reached a significantly (p < .05) higher weight compared to the partial users and the control group at T2 (end of intervention) and at T3 (follow-up).

0	4081799	Linear regression analysis on primary outcome (weight change from T1 (baseline) to T3 (follow-up)) identified six predictors in the intention-to-treat Relapse prevention sample published previously [33].
1	4955417	The mean Paracetamol® dose/patient was 3.96 ± 1.43, 2.94 ± 0.81, 2.18 ± 0.69 and 1.87 ± 0.78 in groups ring opened, ST, DL and SL, respectively, (P < 0.001) [Figure 1].
0	4955417	Reasons for the external ring incision, twist and double ligation of the sac were unclear, suggesting that; the practice may have originated from surgical mentorship.  
1	4799034	Further reductions in Lactic Acid Sting Test scores were observed after 4 weeks of treatment (27.3 ± 7.2% for Atopalm Multi-Lamellar Emulsion Cream and 34.1 ± 8% for Physiogel Intensive Cream, no significant difference was observed between these two products).
0	4799034	Thus, improved barrier function induced by these two products may not only alleviate inflammation, but may also prevent substances from penetrating the skin, suggesting potential utilization of these products for the prevention and treatment of sensitive skin.
1	5668004	vascular endothelial growth factor and GLUT-1 expression were significantly positively associated with complete response (complete response) to treatment in all leave-one-out iterations.
1	5668004	The reduced elastic net model for OVERALL SURVIVAL showed that haemoglobin basal level was associated with a higher risk of death in 98 of 108 (≈91%) leave-one-out iterations.
1	5668004	Basal Haemoglobin levels (≥ 13 gr/dl-1) expression was positively correlated with Pathologic complete response as previously observed [5].

1	4881703	ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. Tapentadol group patients had significantly better analgesia 3 h after the drug and "on coughing" than tramadol group.
1	4881703	The difference in their effects on blood creatinine levels, temperature, hemodynamics, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were not clinically significant.
1	4881703	Tapentadol produced lesser drowsiness and lesser vomiting than tramadol.

0	4881703	nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been implicated to cause other side effects such as gastritis and renal dysfunction.
0	4881703	We also compared the effects of the two drugs on various systems.  
1	4472939	The net effect of atorvastatin on C-reactive protein levels was −32% (p < 0.0001) compared with placebo.
1	4472939	By comparison, atorvastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 42% (p < 0.0001) from baseline to 1 year.
0	4472939	The baseline median LDL-cholesterol concentration was 3.1 (2.6, 3.6) mmol/l [118.4 (99.8, 137.6) mg/dl].
0	4472939	We also found a low correlation between C-reactive protein change and LDL-cholesterol change with statin.
1	3329632	Ranibizumab monotherapy was associated with an incremental gain of 0.17 quality-adjusted life-year and cost of £4 191, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £24 028 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to laser monotherapy (table 3).
1	3329632	Combination therapy provided an incremental gain of 0.13 quality-adjusted life-year over laser monotherapy for an incremental cost of £4 695, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £36 106 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.  
0	3329632	Combined ranibizumab and laser therapy resulted in a 0.13 quality-adjusted life-year gain at an incremental cost of £4695 relative to laser monotherapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio £36 106; 42% probability of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <£30 000).  
0	3329632	The Phase III RESTORE trial enrolled 345 patients with visual impairment due to Diabetic macular oedema and assessed ranibizumab given either as monotherapy or in combination with laser photocoagulation, compared with laser photocoagulation alone.
1	4283272	During the course of the study, the C-peptide area under the curve fell to a similar extent and significantly from baseline in each group (table 2); comparison of these differences was not significant (p=0·91; figure 2A).
1	4283272	Blood glucose area under the curve rose by 2·04 mmol/L (95% CI 1·09–2·99) in the treatment group and 3·05 mmol/L (95% CI 1·17–4·92) in the placebo group, and was not significantly different between groups (p=0·23; figure 2B).
1	4283272	Insulin use increased with time in both groups, and was significantly increased for the treatment group over time.
1	4283272	The increase was not significant for the placebo group or significantly different between groups (p=0·31; figure 2D).
1	4283272	IDA-A1C increased slightly in both groups; the increase was significant for the treatment group with time, but not for the placebo group or between groups (p=0·8; figure 2E).
1	4283272	87 events were identified as possibly related to treatment, but were distributed equally between treatment and placebo groups (p=0·71).
1	4283272	The frequencies of various adverse events and the frequencies of hypoglyacemic events did not differ significantly between the two groups (table 3).  
0	4283272	At 12 months, the mean change in C-peptide area under curve was −229 pmol/L (95% CI −316 to −142) for the treatment group and −253 pmol/L (−383 to −123) for the placebo group; this difference was not significant (p=0·77).
0	4283272	In this study, those participants entering more than 3 months after diagnosis but who still maintained C-peptide production did not seem to have a worse course than those entering within the first 3 months after diagnosis.  
0	4283272	The primary endpoint was C-peptide response to a mixed meal challenge at 12 months measured as 2 h area under curve.
0	4283272	186 (70%) were either ineligible, declined to participate, or could not be reached after initial contact (figure 1).
0	4283272	Further trials including these drugs might be warranted, but should be designed to ensure appropriate selection of participants and increases in these intermediary hormones.  
0	4283272	Residual β-cell function was assessed at baseline, and 6 and 12 months with a 2-h mixed-meal tolerance test (mixed-meal tolerance test).
0	4283272	Although a short duration of disease is often regarded as important to maximise C-peptide at entry, this duration might not be as important by itself.
1	4397550	Demographic data were comparable between the groups.
1	4397550	Median duration of analgesia was 16 h in group I and 20 h in group II (P = 0.002).
1	4397550	The maximum median visual analog scale was 4 in group I and 2 in group II (P = 0.002).
1	4397550	The median duration of analgesia was 16 (12–16) h in group I and 20 (16–24) h in group II (P = 0.002), which was statistically significant.
1	4397550	Capogna and coworkers[6] in their study of intrathecal buprenorphine for suprapuic prostatectomy in elderly patients reported post-operative analgesia persisting more than 7 h. Similar results were reported when buprenorphine was used in intraoral nerve blocks for minor dental procedures in outpatient procedures.[7] Addition of buprenorphine not only prolonged the duration but also the quality of analgesia because the time to achieve max visual analog scale was 7 h in group II and 5 h in group I. The pain scores, both visual analog scale and dynamic VAS, were low in both the groups; however, the number of analgesic demands and total analgesic consumed in group II was significantly low (P = 0.007).
1	4397550	The area under curve that represents the composite value for visual analog scale and dynamic VAS pain scores distributed over a period of 24 h was significantly low in group II, 9, than in group I (P = 0.047 and 0.017), respectively.  
0	4397550	The visual analog scale scores are shown in Table 2.
0	4397550	All patients received standard general anesthesia with fentanyl 2 μg/kg as analgesic.
0	4397550	Sedation score was not statistically or clinically significant in the present study.  
0	4397550	This may probably be because of the addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic and also to the usage of a high dose of buprenorphine.
0	4397550	An increasing number of studies recently reported the existence of opioid receptors outside the central nervous system, and the demonstration that opioid receptors exist in the peripheral nervous system offers the possibility of providing post-operative analgesia[345] Opioids when administered peripherally act on peripheral opioid receptors without central action and eliminate unwanted central side-effects, mainly like respiratory and cardiac depression, sedation and pruiritus.
0	4397550	A standard Percutaneous nephrolithotomy was performed and, at the end of the procedure, group I patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and group II patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 100 μg buprenorphine peritubally.
1	4118506	The median interquartile range pain score is worst for placebo group after LA injection (5 [3-6]) and in the immediate postprocedure period (5 [4-5]) which was significantly attenuated by addition of fentanyl (3.5 [2-5] and 3 [2-4]) (P = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively).
1	4118506	Overall, fentanyl and placebo group were not statistically different with median discomfort score except at T10 (P = 0.047).  
1	4118506	Respiratory events were defined as SpO2 <92% and/or respiratory rate (respiratory rate) <8 breaths/min.
1	4118506	A decrease in SpO2 to <92%for >30 s was treated sequentially with verbal stimulation, head tilt-chin lift, Guedel airway, and bag-mask-assisted ventilation.
1	4118506	There were no significant differences between the study group of patients in terms of demographics, baseline respiratory, cardiovascular parameters, and level of consciousness [Table 1].   
1	4118506	The median sedation score for fentanyl group was significantly less in the immediate postprocedure period (T10) compared to placebo group, but for the rest of the time points we did not find a significant difference in median sedation score between the study groups [Figure 3].  
1	4118506	More patients from fentanyl group (4/26) experienced episodes of SpO2 < 92%, compared with placebo group (0/25), but the difference did not reach statistical significance [Table 2].  
0	4118506	In contrast to their study,[7] our procedure was of shorter duration and probably the magnitude of pain also would have been less compared to tunneled catheterization where not only local anesthetics infiltration, but also subcutaneous tunneling induces greater pain.
0	4118506	The median pain scores discomfort score and sedation score in fentanyl and placebo group are given in Figure 1–3 respectively.
0	4118506	Ensuring adequate analgesia and sedation is therefore essential for patient comfort and satisfaction.  
0	4118506	Pain and discomfort using a verbal numeric rating pain scale at 5 times points during Central venous catheterization insertion were assessed and analyzed.  
0	4118506	Comparison between groups revealed that placebo group had worst pain scores after LA injection, which was significantly attenuated by addition of study drugs in fentanyl group (P = 0.009).
0	4118506	Scores for discomfort, pain, sedation, cardiovascular event, respiratory events and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded at rest by an anesthesia resident at 5 times points: Time 1, at base line (T1); Time 2, after initial local anesthetics injection (LA injection) (T2);
0	4118506	For our study, we have defined pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that arises from actual or potential tissue damage associated with Central venous catheterization.
1	4994668	There was no significant difference in quality-adjusted survival between infliximab and ciclosporin: the observed mean total area under the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire curve was 564·0 (SD 241·9) in the infliximab group and 587·0 (226·2) in the ciclosporin group (mean adjusted difference 7·9 [95% CI −22·0 to 37·8]; p=0·603).
1	4994668	There was no significant difference between groups in terms of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire scores (mean adjusted difference in AUC/day of survivors 0·020 [95% CI −0·019 to 0·0581]; p=0·319; figure 3A), SF-6D scores (mean adjusted difference 0·005 [95% CI −0·025 to 0·035]; p=0·737; figure 3B), or EQ-5D scores (QALY mean adjusted difference 0·021 [95% CI −0·032 to 0·096]; p=0·350; figure 3C).
1	4994668	Furthermore, there was also no significant difference between allocated groups in colectomy rates (in-hospital: 29 [21%] of 135 patients in the infliximab group vs 34 [25%] of 135 patients in the ciclosporin group; at 3 months: 39 [29%] vs 41 [30%]; 12 months: 47 [35%] vs 61 [45%]; overall: 55 [41%] vs 65 [48%]; odds ratio [odds ratio] 1·350 [95% CI 0·832 to 2·188]; p=0·223); or time to colectomy (mean time to colectomy 811 [95% CI 707–912] days in the infliximab group vs 744 [638–850] days in the ciclosporin group; hazard ratio 1·234 [95% CI 0·862 to 1·768]; p=0·251; figure 4).
1	4994668	There was no significant difference between the two drugs in serious adverse reactions, or serious adverse events: 16 serious adverse reactions were noted in 14 participants given infliximab and ten in nine given ciclosporin (event ratio 0·938 [95% CI 0·590–1·493]; p=0·788; table 3).
1	4994668	The cost-utility analysis found that total health service costs over 30 months were £5632 (95% CI 2773–8305) higher for patients receiving infliximab, mainly due to the higher acquisition costs for infliximab (p=0·001).
0	4994668	Quality-adjusted survival13 was measured as the total area under the curve (appendix p 1) described by scores from the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire (Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire, formerly CCQ),14, 15 which was completed by participants at baseline, 3 and 6 months, then every 6 months from 1 year to 3 years.
0	4994668	Although length of stay after randomisation ostensibly did not differ between allocated groups (mean 10·32 [SD 13·55] in the infliximab group vs 12·21 [10·18] in the ciclosporin group; mean adjusted difference 1·542 days [95% CI −1·297 to 4·381], assuming normal distribution of residuals in general linear model; p=0·286), the distribution was so skewed as to invalidate the assumption of normality.
0	4994668	We note that the US Food and Drug Administration has expressed its dissatisfaction with current use of disease activity scores as primary endpoints in inflammatory bowel disease trials, and is moving towards patient-reported outcome measures.28 This study is—to the best of our knowledge—the first major pragmatic drug trial in inflammatory bowel disease to use a disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure to assess primary outcome, and used an instrument that enabled measurement of change in quality of life through different disease states, including after surgery.
0	4994668	Although by convention low scores indicate better health on disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, for the purposes of presenting the area under the curve, the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire score was transformed so that a lower score indicated worse health.
0	4994668	Patients randomly allocated to receive infliximab were given 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 2 h at baseline, and again at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the first infusion, in accordance with local prescribing guidelines.
1	4235088	psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score significantly improved after medication in all the three groups (groups of lactulose + probiotic: −3.8 ± 3.9 to −1.6 ± 3.0; Gp-L: −4.8 ± 4.1 to −1.6 ± 2.9; and group of patients received probiotic alone: −4.9 ± 3.7 to −2.1 ± 2.5, P < 0.001).
1	4235088	After 8 weeks follow-up, there was a deterioration in the Gp-L (−1.6 ± 2.9 to −4.8 ± 4.2), while the status of the groups of lactulose + probiotic and group of patients received probiotic alone arms did not change significantly [Figure 2].  
0	4235088	After 8 weeks follow-up, improvement was maintained in groups of lactulose + probiotic and group of patients received probiotic alone, but there was deterioration in those who did not receive probiotics (Gp-L: psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score score reversed to −4.8 ± 4.2).
0	4235088	All continuous variables had normal distribution; therefore, analysis of variance (analysis of variance) was applied for comparing continuous variables among the three groups and paired t-test was applied for evaluating changes in each group.
1	3506580	No significant alterations of pain ratings were found.
1	3506580	Modalities of quantitative sensory testing remained equally unchanged.
1	3506580	It is therefore hypothesized that a single 15 mins session of Transcranial direct current stimulation at 1 mA may not be sufficient to alter the perception of experimental pain and in patients with chronic pain.
1	3506580	There was no significant difference of the perceived mean pain intensity before and after Transcranial direct current stimulation stimulation for the factors time (PREPOST: F(1,13) = 0.85; p = 0.374) and stimulation modality (stimulation mode: F(2,26) = 0.93; p = 0.379) and no interaction between STIM*PREPOST (F(2,26) = 1.18; p = 0.323).

1	3506580	There were no significant distribution differences for the 30% cut-off (P = 0.093).  
1	3506580	There were no significant differences of heat pain thresholds before and after Transcranial direct current stimulation (PREPOST: F(1,9) = 0.82; p = 0.389) and between treatment modalities (stimulation mode: F(2,18) = 1.27; p = 0.306).

1	3506580	Likewise, a three factor repeated measures analysis of variance for repeated measures using non-normalized data across all 10 blocks did not yield significant results for the factors PREPOST: F(1,11) = 1.67; p = 0.222) stimulation mode (F(2,22) = 0.56; p = 0.509) and BLOCK (F(9,99) = 2.87; p = 0.103) and the corresponding interactions (STIM*PREPOST: F(2,22) = 0.13; p = 0.767; STIM*BLOCK: F(18,198) = 0.70; p = 0.554; PREPOST*BLOCK: F(9,99) = 1.86; p = 0.188; STIM*PREPOST*BLOCK: F(18,198) = 1.1; p = 0.363).
1	3506580	Individual patient responses are shown in Table 3.
1	3506580	There were no significant distribution differences (P = 0.762) for a 30% cut-off.  
1	3506580	All patients reported that their back pain remained unchanged in intensity and quality after each stimulation session compared to baseline assessment as given in Table 1.  
0	3506580	Results are given as two-tailed probability values.  
0	3506580	The mean threshold temperature of three measurements was calculated.  
0	3506580	Moreover, the neurophysiological background has still not been fully understood and little is known about the effects of Transcranial direct current stimulation on experimental pain in patients with chronic pain.
0	3506580	While trials on healthy participants did report pain perception changes after a single session of stimulation with 1 mA [5], [7], [8], [9], trials on chronic pain populations mostly applied higher intensities of Transcranial direct current stimulation, typically 2 mA for 20 minutes on 2–10 consecutive days [11], [12], [13], [38], [39].
0	3506580	The present study investigated the effect of a single session of anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation (15 mins/1 mA) over the primary motor cortex on the perceived intensity of repeated noxious thermal and electrical stimuli and on elements of quantitative sensory testing (thermal pain and perception thresholds) applied to the right hand in 15 patients with chronic low back pain.
0	3506580	Each participant received all three modes of stimulation (anodal, cathodal, and sham).
0	3506580	Thermal thresholds were determined by using a TSA-II (Medoc Ltd. Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel) device with a thermode of Peltier elements (contact area 16×16 mm, 32°C baseline temperature, ramped stimuli with 1°C/s).
0	3506580	Thermal sensation may be more susceptible to cortical excitability changes following Transcranial direct current stimulation than nociception, especially as Transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex induces widespread central activity changes [2].
0	3506580	Additionally, a repeated measures analysis of variance for repeated measures was calculated with pain ratings of the 10 successive blocks each with the factors stimulation mode (stimulation mode; anodal, cathodal, sham), time with respect to the intervention (PREPOST; before and after Transcranial direct current stimulation intervention) and pain rating per block (BLOCK; pain ratings to heat pain paradigm block 1–10 respectively 1–9 for normalized data).  
0	3506580	Non-parametric tests confirmed these findings.  
0	3506580	Participants were asked to remain quiet in a supine position during stimulation.  
0	3506580	However, it has been shown that thermal perception and nociception have their own labeled lines and receptors resulting in a central integration of all neuronal input [41].
1	3750227	The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril.
1	3750227	The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study.
1	3750227	The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point.
1	3750227	There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.  
1	3750227	Furthermore, among those terminating the study there were no significant differences in urinary potassium with respect to baseline values (79.6 ± 9.4 vs. 81.1 ± 8.1 mmol/L for olmesartan and 81.7 ± 15.2 vs. 62.7 ± 6.5 mmol/L for enalapril) or appreciable changes in daily urine sodium elimination.
0	3750227	This decrease only reached statistical significance when compared with analysis of variance indicating a detectable trend towards a positive effect.
0	3750227	The explanation could lie in the different half lives of these drugs (12 hours for lisinopril and 6 hours for valsartan) [39], which could mean valsartan had less effect on potassium levels.
0	3750227	If the patient required a drug to lower blood pressure we did this with different doses of doxazosine or calcium-channel-blockers.
0	3750227	Blood pressure and estimated GFR were measured as described elsewhere [13,30].
0	3750227	Therefore, nephrologists face a paradoxical and clinically significant challenge in this realm because those patients who would benefit most from treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are precisely those with the highest risk of adverse effects.

1	5315239	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively), and so did general health perception differences at 6 months (P = .018).  
1	5315239	No patient had adverse effects at injection or follow-up.
1	5315239	No differences were found in the use of painkillers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or dose or frequency between groups at any time point.
1	5315239	At 6 months, patient satisfaction tended to be higher in the study group; however, we were unable to find statistically significant differences (P = .472) (Table 3).  
0	5315239	Although we found that a single platelet-rich plasma intra-articular injection reduces pain, we could not prove its superiority in terms of effectiveness and lasting pain relief compared with corticosteroid with local anesthetic.  
0	5315239	Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests.
0	5315239	The reason not to extend the study beyond 6 months was to prevent patients from having to wait a year to receive a new treatment, if necessary.
0	5315239	Volunteer participants were assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups and assessed on a number of variables before and at 3 points after treatment (1, 3, and 6 months).
1	4361464	At 2 years, delayed-release dimethyl fumarate BID and times daily reduced the annualized relapse rate by 56% and 60% (both p < 0.0001), risk of relapse by 54% and 57% (both p < 0.0001), and risk of 12-week confirmed disability progression by 71% (p < 0.0001) and 47% (p = 0.0085) versus placebo.
1	4361464	In a subset of patients (magnetic resonance imaging cohort), delayed-release dimethyl fumarate BID and times daily reduced the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions by 80% and 81%, gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity by 92% and 92%, and mean number of new non-enhancing T1-hypointense lesions by 68% and 70% (all p < 0.0001 versus placebo).
1	4361464	On the basis of Kaplan–Meier estimates, the proportion of patients relapsed at 2 years was 0.42 in the placebo group, 0.21 in the delayed-release dimethyl fumarate BID group, and 0.21 in the delayed-release dimethyl fumarate times daily group, representing relative reductions of 54% (BID) and 57% (times daily; both p < 0.0001 vs. placebo; Figure 3(a)).  
0	4361464	Indeed, associations between multiple sclerosis disease activity and long-term clinical prognosis seem to become weaker over time, suggesting an early window of maximal therapeutic opportunity.23–25  There is no accepted universal criterion for newly diagnosed or "early" relapsing–remitting MS.
0	4361464	As neurodegenerative effects including axonal transection are observed from the early stages of the disease2 and greater frequency of relapse and higher lesion load in early multiple sclerosis are associated with poorer long-term outcomes22–25, immediate intervention in newly diagnosed patients may slow the accumulation of damage and progression of disability.
0	4361464	The proportion of patients relapsed was derived using Kaplan–Meier analysis and analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards model with study as a stratifying factor, and adjusted for baseline age (<40 vs. ≥40), region, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score (≤2.0 vs. >2.0), and number of relapses in the year prior to study entry.

0	3307993	A double-blind placebo-controlled trial to study therapeutic effects of probiotic     ABSTRACT.PURPOSE. 
0	3307993	Safety was assessed by recording all adverse events according to Good Clinical Practice for clinical trials of medication in the European Community (91/507/EWG, CPMP/ICH/135/95).
0	3307993	Indeed, recent placebo-controlled irritable bowel syndrome clinical trials demonstrate a similar therapeutic gain of approximately 10–20% in positive studies [17].
0	3307993	Pathophysiological factors which are thought to play a role comprise alterations of the intestinal milieu, immune activation, enteric neuromuscular dysfunction and brain–gut axis dysregulation.
0	3307993	But, this exploratory study aimed to define subgroups of patients with irritable bowel syndrome who may benefit from treatment with the probiotic EcN. Indeed, the results are promising for the subgroup of irritable bowel syndrome patients with altered enteric flora due to gastroenterocolitis or administration of antibiotics.
1	4137650	The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001) and esmolol (P < 0.0001) after laryngoscopy and intubation compared with baseline value and Group D (P = 0.6294).
1	4137650	The rise in heart rate (P = 0.08481) and rate pressure product (P = 0.0666) at the time of intubation were minimal and was statistically significant up to 15 min in Group D.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:. 
1	4137650	Table 1 Patient's characteristics   The increase in mean heart rate after intubation was seen in all the three groups.
1	4137650	But the mean increase was minimal 5.83% in Group D (4 beats, P = 0.0848), when compared with Group E 14% (9.81beats; P = 0.0152) and Group C 30% (24.9 beats; P < 0.0001), which was highly significant (P < 0.0001).
1	4137650	Figure 1Mean heart rate of patients in Groups C-D  The mean systolic arterial pressure levels in Group D were significantly lower than Groups C and E immediately after intubation (P < 0.001, P > 0.001 respectively) and until the end of surgery.
1	4137650	Table 2 Comparison of systolic arterial pressure (mm of Hg) in the three groups   The diastolic arterial pressure levels in Group D were significantly lower than Groups C and E at all times after intubation.
1	4137650	In our study the rate pressure product during intubation revealed a highly significant increase in Group C (76.5%, P < 0.0001) and significant increase in Group E (49%, P < 0.001), whereas the increase was insignificant in Group D (16%, P > 0.0666).
1	4137650	These changes were highly significant up to 15 min post-intubation.
1	4137650	Although comparing Group E to Group D the increase in rate pressure product in Group E at the time of intubation (P < 0.001) was statistically significant.
1	4137650	The rise in mean rate pressure product was least in Group D and highest in Group C [Figure 2].  
0	4137650	Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring neurotransmitters epinephrine and nor-epinephrine, there by attenuates the tachycardia and hypertensive responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.  
0	4137650	The rise in mean arterial pressure was highly significant after intubation in Group C (P < 0.0001) and significant in Group E (P < 0.05) which was not significant in Group D (P > 0.05) [Table 4].  
0	4137650	Rapid administration of dexmedetomidine might produce tachycardia, bradycardia and hypertension followed by hypotension.
0	4137650	BODY.C. Evaluation of baseline and immediately after intubation values, revealed a greater percentage variation in mean arterial pressure in the esmolol and control groups as compared to the dexmedetomidine group.
0	4137650	Therefore, within the constraints of this study we demonstrated that administration of a single dose of dexmedetomidine before general anesthesia induction was an effective method for attenuating the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation.
0	4137650	In contrast to the previously mentioned studies,[161819] we did not detected any excessive reduction in heart rate or systemic blood pressure values in the dexmedetomidine group compared with other groups.
0	4137650	The demographic profile of the patients in terms of age, body weight, male:female ratio, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, Mallampati Class were comparable and there were no significant differences among the three groups (P > 0.05) [Table 1].

1	5753687	The values were 8.7±2.3 at the start of the study and 7.2±1.9 at the 12-month follow-up in the control group, which indicates significant differences in the two groups (p<0.01, UC-MSC vs control) (Fig. 2D).
0	5753687	Patients should undergo bone marrow collection in advance and wait for the culture of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, of which the duration and cell quantities were varying.18 The source of umbilical cord MSCs in the current study was from one donor, which had the advantages of homogeneity, constant cell number, and good comparability of efficacy.  
0	5753687	It was suggested that downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor played a beneficial role.13,14 The possibility to dampen Th17 cells and increase the apoptotic rate of effector T-cells, while favoring the expansion of both T-cell and macrophage population with regulatory function was of biological relevance.17  The therapeutic processes using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were more complicated.
0	5753687	The majority of patients eventually need surgery to remove the diseased bowel.2,3 However, the recurrence rate of Crohn's disease can reach 75%.4  Although its etiology is unclear, most researchers believe that Crohn's disease is associated with autoimmune response, and that inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and free radicals are involved in chronic inflammatory lesions.5  In recent years, stem cell transplantation has emerged as a promising treatment, which is characterized by regulating immunity, repairing injury, and controlling inflammation.

1	3561645	Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy significantly reduced the risk of episodes of high reliever use (>6 inhalations/day) vs. all alternative ICS/LABA regimens.
1	3561645	In both studies the risk of any episode with >6 inhalations/day of reliever was reduced with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy vs. comparators (P ≤ 0.014; Table 2 and 3).  
1	3561645	The risk of hospitalisation/ER visits in Study B during the 21-day period was significantly (P < 0.05) lower for both budesonide/formoterol regimens compared with fixed-dose salmeterol/fluticasone (Table 3).
0	3561645	The utility of high reliever use events as a marker for an impending exacerbation could be tested by examining the short-term increase in the conversion to a severe exacerbation.

0	5414231	Furthermore, the expressions of anti-transforming growth factor β and IL-10 in the cystic wall obviously decreased after irradiation, indicating that irradiation contributes to the attenuation of the inflammatory reaction and infection in the host.  
1	5103733	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05), except for the mean arterial pressure, which was higher in the esmolol group compared with the control group at 5 and 12 h post-surgery (P<0.05).
1	5103733	However, the serum level of cardiac troponin I was higher in patients of the control group compared with those of the esmolol group during the preoperative period (P<0.05).
1	5103733	The serum levels of creatine kinase (Fig. 2B) did not show any significant difference between the two groups at four of the five time points (baseline, before aortic cannulation, before aortic cross-clamp and 120 min after the release of aortic cross-clamp); however, the levels were significantly higher in the esmolol group compared with the control group (esmolol group, 125.67±30.81 IU/ml; control group, 89.67±23.31 IU/ml; P=0.002).
0	5103733	One of the most important observations of the present randomized controlled trial on Chinese patients scheduled for elective open-heart cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass was that esmolol administration was able to maintain the heart rate within 80% of the pre-bypass levels that resulted in a marked reduction in the serum levels of a TnI-a specific marker of myocardial injury.

1	5812048	However, Heart rate values for condition were higher than caffeine anhydrous at 30-min (p = 0.013).
0	5812048	Overall, the findings of this study are suggestive that the presence or absence of caffeine prior to multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis provides little influence on body fat percentage, total body water, extracellular body water, or intracellular body water in habitual users.
0	5812048	However, post hoc analysis revealed no statistically significant pairwise comparisons.
0	5812048	A series of condition (condition, caffeine anhydrous, and placebo) x time (preliminary measurements, 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, 75-, and 90-min) repeated measures analysis of variance (repeated measures analysis of variance) were performed to compare the differences in body fat percentage, total body water, extracellular body water, and intracellular body water mean values between the different testing conditions and time points.
0	5812048	The absorption rate of water from the gastrointestinal tract typically occurs within five-minutes of consumption [22].
0	5812048	Caffeine's role as a diuretic is relatively understood, but it is unclear if caffeine consumption truly influences cellular fluid balance, which could affect the calculation of intracellular (intracellular body water), extracellular (extracellular body water), or total body water when measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis.

1	5029935	Higher long-term oxygen therapy duration analyzed as a continuous variable was not associated with any change in mortality rate (hazard ratio [hazard ratios] 1.00; (95% confidence interval [confidence interval], 0.98 to 1.02) per 1 h/day increase above 15 h/day.
1	5029935	Mortality was similar between the groups for all-cause, respiratory and cardiovascular mortality.
1	5029935	In hypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term oxygen therapy 24 h/day was not associated with a survival benefit compared with treatment 15–16 h/day.
1	5029935	Adjusted mortality rates were similar for deaths from all causes and from respiratory and cardiovascular disease.  
0	5029935	In the present study, long-term oxygen therapy 24 h/day was associated with an increased mortality risk in the unadjusted analysis, but the survival difference disappeared when controlling for confounders including prescribed oxygen dose and WHO performance status.
0	5029935	The adjusted hazard plots of the treatment groups closely overlapped at all time points (Fig 1).  
0	5029935	Whereas the survival benefit of long-term oxygen therapy 15 h/day or more is established,[1, 2] the mechanisms for the improvement in survival still remains unknown.
0	5029935	A total of 2,249 included patients were included with a median follow-up of 1.1 years (interquartile range, 0.6–2.1).
1	3271295	The slope of Appel ALS rating scale was 1.17 points/month lower while the patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid than with placebo (95% CI for difference 0.08-2.26, P = 0.037), whereas the slopes of ALSFRS-R and forced vital capacity did not show significant differences between treatments.
1	3271295	Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05).
1	3271295	However, the slope of neither ALSFRS-R nor forced vital capacity (%) did not show any significant differences between treatments.
1	3271295	The slope of Appel ALS rating scale was 1.63 points/month slower while the patients were treated with oral solubilized ursodeoxycholic acid than with placebo (2.24 vs 3.88 points/month, 95% CI for difference 0.60-2.68, P = 0.004), whereas the ALSFRS-R and forced vital capacity (%) deteriorated without significant differences between the two treatments.
1	3271295	As for the PP'' datasets, the time to a 20-points progression in the Appel ALS rating scale total score was estimated to be delayed by 14.9 months in oral solubilized UDCA-treated group compared to placebo-treated group (22.5 vs 7.6 months, 95% CI for difference 2.97-26.8 months, P = 0.018) (Fig. 2).
1	3271295	Gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more common in patients treated with oral solubilized ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05), but serious events were reported in only one patient who discontinued the drug due to abdominal pain, anorexia and vomiting.
0	3271295	The primary outcome was the rate of progression, assessed by the Appel Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rating scale (Appel ALS rating scale), and the secondary outcomes were the revised Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity).
0	3271295	Inclusion started in March 2005, and the final patient completed the study in July 2007.
0	3271295	None of the 80 patients who were randomized died during the 8-month period of study, with tracheostomy performed in 2 patients.  
0	3271295	These results suggest that oral ursodeoxycholic acid is well delivered to CSF of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and the therapeutic effects deserve to be expected although it remains to be elucidated which formula or dose of ursodeoxycholic acid is more tolerated, absorbed, delivered and effective in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.  
0	3271295	Patients who had a forced vital capacity of less than 30%, those with signs of major psychiatric disorders and/or dementia, and acute cholecystitis or occlusion of bile duct, or patients who had another concomitant conditions likely to interfere with drug compliance and outcome assessment were excluded.
0	3271295	There was no stratification of patients according to the onset region, age or respiratory function, since all the patients enrolled were supposed to receive both treatments (oral solubilized ursodeoxycholic acid and placebo) sequentially in this cross-over trial.
1	5820800	Adjusted for potential baseline determinants and leukocyte composition, early parenteral nutrition was associated with telomere shortening during paediatric ICU stay as compared with late parenteral nutrition (estimate early versus late parenteral nutrition –0.021 T/S-units, 95% confidence interval −0.038; 0.004, P = 0.01).
1	5820800	The neutrophil fraction decreased from paediatric ICU admission to discharge in both groups, but even more in the early parenteral nutrition than in the late parenteral nutrition group (P = 0.007) (Fig. 3b).
0	5820800	As critically ill children often suffer from an underlying chronic disease or are admitted to the paediatric ICU after an insult characterised by hypoxia or inflammation, we hypothesised that leukocyte telomeres in critically ill children upon paediatric ICU admission are shorter than those of matched healthy children.
0	5820800	Indeed, in most somatic cells telomere length declines with age, with a most pronounced loss during early life, which can be explained by steady proliferation of stem cells and immune cells after birth [21].
1	5154305	In patients with a high disease activity at baseline, the clinical efficacy of abatacept was similar to adalimumab and tocilizumab.
1	5154305	Compared with TNF-alpha treatment, the onset of action abatacept was delayed; it took a longer time to relapse and a smaller proportion of patients relapsed after stopping the treatment [37].

1	4260664	The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups at post treatment, neither on Beck Depression Inventory-II, MADRS-S, nor Beck Anxiety Inventory.
1	4260664	A comparison of baseline scores revealed no significant difference between treatment groups and the randomization as expected produced a similar distribution across conditions (see Table 1).
1	4260664	χ2 tests failed to reveal any significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics.
0	4260664	All inventories were administered in paper format, except the MADRS-S at Weeks 3 and 7 which for practical reasons had to be administered via the secure e-mail system.

1	4234827	Mortality at day 90 was similar in both groups (25.7% versus 29.9%), but duration of sedation was shorter in the early tracheotomy group median 11 days (range 2 to 92) days compared to 14 days (range 0 to 79) in the late group (P <0.02).
1	4234827	In these subgroup of patients (per-protocol analysis) no differences existed in mortality at day 90 between the two groups, but the early group had more ventilator-free days, less duration of sedation and less length of stay, than the late group.  
1	4234827	Mortality at day 90 was similar in the early and the late group: 25.7% (63 of 245 participants) versus 29.9% (73 of 244) (P = 0.2996).

1	5062234	The 24 h morphine requirement (mean ± standard deviation) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in transversus abdominis plane group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group (P = 0.688).
1	5062234	The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in transversus abdominis plane group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 (P = 0.028).
1	5062234	The visual analog scale scores at rest and on coughing were significantly higher in the local infiltration group in the immediate postoperative period (P = 0.034 and P = 0.007, respectively).  
1	5062234	At 4 h, none of the patients in the transversus abdominis plane group but seven patients (33.3%) in the control group had moderate to severe pain (visual analog scale >3) at rest (P = 0.009*).
1	5062234	At 4 h, eight patients (38.1%) in the transversus abdominis plane group and 15 patients (71.4%) in the control group had moderate to severe pain on coughing (P = 0.03*).
1	5062234	At 12 h, six patients (28.5%) in the transversus abdominis plane group and 18 patients (85.7%) in the control group had moderate to severe pain on coughing (P < 0.001*).
0	5062234	The supplemental dosing of fentanyl (median [minimum–maximum]) in the transversus abdominis plane group was 0 μg (0–120) and in the control group was 30 μg (0–120) (P = 0.013*).
0	5062234	Bilateral transversus abdominis plane block has previously been used for Single incision laparoscopic surgery in bariatric surgery[2] and gynecological surgeries.[3]
0	5062234	A bilateral posterior transversus abdominis plane block was given in a postpartum woman during single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in whom postoperative use of opioids was undesirable.
0	5062234	This shows that transversus abdominis plane block provided better intraoperative analgesia than local infiltration of port site as the hemodynamic parameters were more stable [Figures 3 and 4].  
0	5062234	The blocks were performed by the "classic lateral" ultrasound-guided approach also known as ultrasound-guided mid-axillary line TAP.[12] Abdomen was cleaned and draped.
0	5062234	The total 24 h morphine requirement (mean ± standard deviation) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in transversus abdominis plane group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in control group (P = 0.688).
1	3652505	If the drug effect was described as "of 100 patients taking this kind of medicine, 70 patients became better", people tended to make more positive evaluations, compared with described as "of 100 patients taking this kind of medicine, 30 patients didn't become better" (P < 0.01).
1	3652505	As shown in Table 1, the results revealed that if drug effect was described respectively in a therapeutically effective rate or ineffective rate, the participants gave the former a more positive evaluation (t = 3.34, P = 0.01).
1	3652505	As shown in Table 2 that if the doctor' advise was respectively described in the benefit of compliance and the aftermath of violation, the former one lead to a better compliance (t = 2.14, P = 0.035).  
1	3652505	Table 3 presented the classic Asia Disease Problem which we used as an example of risky choice framing of options equivalent.
1	3652505	The results revealed that in a positive frame, people tend to be risk seeking, while in a negative frame, people tend to be risk avoiding.
1	3652505	The framing effect was significant (t = -2.72, P = 0.007).
1	3652505	Table 4 described the risky choice framing effect when the candidate options were not equivalent.
1	3652505	As the results revealed, if treatment options were described in survival rates, people more preferred the risky option, compared with described in mortality rates (t = 2.09, P = 0.039).
1	3652505	Table 5 described the effect of number size framing.
1	3652505	The results revealed that the number size framing effect was significant in medical situation (t = -7.5, P < 0.001).   
0	3652505	All the frames that were examined leaded to significant framing effects: When the Asia Disease Problem was described in a positive frame, the participants preferred the conservative frame than the risky one, while if in a negative frame, the preference reversed (P < 0.01).
0	3652505	The problem could be presented in a positive (survival rate) or negative (mortality rate) frame which might also result in the risk preference shift, though the effects of surgery and radiation therapy were not equivalent.
0	3652505	Similar to a simple dichotomous scale where a participant would choose one of the two options, participants using a 6 point-scale must also favor one procedure over the other since there is no mid-point.
0	3652505	Radiation therapy: Of 100 people having radiation therapy, none die during the treatment, and 80 die by the end of five years.
0	3652505	In a goal framing: The doctors' advices were respectively described as the benefit brought from compliance and the aftermath of aviation.
0	3652505	The participants complied with the later one more readily.
0	3652505	4.36 ± 1.17 Negative: 100 patients taking one kind of medicine, 30 patients didn’t become better.
0	3652505	For example the widely used medical decision making study material provided the following situation: The decision maker should make a choice between having surgery or radiation therapy.
0	3652505	So the former description can affect people's decision.
0	3652505	(Options Equivalent) Questionnaire Mean Response  a   Positive: There are 600 critically ill patients in one hospital.
1	4907437	There was no significant difference between groups in pain-related disability at 6 or 12 mo (12 mo: difference −1.0, intervention versus control, 95% CI −4.9 to 3.0), pain intensity, or the census global health question.
1	4907437	Anxiety, depression, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, and social integration were better in the intervention group at 6 mo; at 12 mo, these differences remained statistically significant only for depression (−0.7, 95% CI −1.2 to −0.2) and social integration (0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2).
1	4907437	While the Coping with Persistent Pain, Effectiveness Research into Self-management intervention was brief, safe, and inexpensive, with a low attrition rate, it was not effective for reducing pain-related disability over 12 mo (primary outcome).
1	4907437	For secondary outcomes, we found sustained benefits on depression and social integration at 6 and 12 mo, but there was no effect on anxiety, pain-related self-efficacy, pain acceptance, pain intensity, or the census global health question at 12 mo.
1	4907437	There was no difference between the intervention and control groups in response to the census global health question at 6- or 12-mo follow-up (odds ratio for intervention group participants reporting improved state of health at 12 mo was 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51).
1	4907437	Overall, intervention patients received considerably more analgesics than controls in the 12 mo following randomisation (amounting to an average difference of 98 d [95% CI 17 to 178] of medication at WHO DDD).
0	4907437	Most of the participants (85%) had had pain for at least 3 y, with 265 (38%) reporting pain for more than 10 y and 162 (23%) being prescribed strong opioids (as defined in the British National Formulary [40]) at baseline.
0	4907437	We chose the relaxation package because other studies had suggested that although relaxation was popular, it was unlikely to have an effect on our primary outcome of pain-related disability or have long-term effects, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it had a therapeutic effect [15].  
0	4907437	The health economic analysis took a health care provider perspective and estimated the costs of delivering the intervention and all further primary, secondary, and community care costs (see Section 7 of S1 Appendix for more details on methods).
0	4907437	Courses were delivered by two facilitators: a health care professional with experience treating people with chronic musculoskeletal pain (physiotherapist, psychologist, osteopath, or general practitioner) and a lay person living with chronic pain.
0	4907437	Full details of the statistical methods can be found in the analysis plan (including details for all subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and analyses of secondary outcomes) [17], which was finalised before any investigators had unmasked access to trial data.
0	4907437	Currently, it is difficult to justify the intervention's use for those without depression, and we do not know its effectiveness if only people with probable depression are included in the group intervention.  
1	2781775	When the data of all variables were changed into dichotomous responses of either 'improved' or 'not improved', three of the variables [veterinary-assessed mobility index (P = 0.018), force plate peak vertical force (P = 0.006) and pain VAS (P = 0.043)] indicated significantly more improved dogs in the homeopathic combination preparation group compared with the placebo group.
0	2781775	But, as carprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can potentially have severe side-effects such as hepatic disease, renal toxicosis and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, ultimately leading to hemorrhagic ulcers and even death (28,29), it is of utmost importance that we continue doing clinical research on all alternative treatments for osteoarthritis.  
1	4760038	Needle visibility score was better in group II (2.92 ± 0.26 vs. 1.9 ± 0.44, P < 0.0001).
1	4760038	Block performance time was shorter in group II (90.92 ± 15 vs. 128.25 ± 16s, P < 0.0001).
1	4760038	A number of needle passes were less in group II (1.27 ± 0.45 vs. 2.2 ± 0.68, P < 0.0001).
1	4760038	Doctor and patient satisfaction were better in group II (P = 0.015).
1	4760038	No differences were found regarding the duration of the block and incidence of complications between groups.  
1	4760038	Doctor and patient satisfaction were better in group II when compared to group I with a P < 0.0001 and = 0.001, respectively.
1	4760038	No differences were found regarding duration of the block (4.64 ± 0.61 vs.4.62 ± 0.63, P = 1.00).
1	4760038	And incidence of complications (2 [2.5%] vs. 0, P = 0.49) between the two groups [Table 2].  
0	4760038	If pain persisted after 20 min, another dose of morphine 0.025 mg/kg would be given.  
0	4760038	Patient characteristics and procedural data of the study population were shown in Table 1.   
0	4760038	But that may require the use of longer block needles that can be more difficult to manipulate.
0	4760038	Supplemental oxygen (via nasal prongs at 4 L/min) was also applied.
0	4760038	Whichever group was written on the paper determined the block technique that was to be used in that patient.  
0	4760038	Promoting patient safety and increasing health care quality have dominated the health care landscape during the last 15 years.
0	4760038	However, accurate and consistent visualization of the needle tip can be difficult to achieve.[3]
0	4760038	Needle visualization is important for safe and successful ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block.
1	2956883	In the primary efficacy analysis, incidence of HIV-1 did not differ between groups at discontinuation of 2% PRO2000 or study end (table 2).
1	2956883	Equally, incidence of HIV-1 did not differ between groups in the second analysis that did not censor for pregnancy (table 2).  
1	2956883	Gel efficacy against HIV-1 transmission did not differ between centres (p=0·19 for interaction), or between consistent (HR 0·97, 95% CI 0·87–1·35, p=0·87) and inconsistent (1·17, 0·42–1·72, p=0·42) gel users (p=0·47 for interaction).

1	4064768	The urinary urgency and nocturnal urinary urgency were decreased by 58.8% (p= 0.008) and 39.7% (p= 0.001) respectively in Oxybutinin group and 41.8% (p= 0.000) and 39.1% (p= 0.001) respectively in Tolterodine group.
1	4064768	In this study the discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events had no significant difference in two groups (6% and 8% in oxybutinin and tolterodine group respectively, p= 0.082) dry mouth was the most common side-effect in both groups (30% in oxybutinin group and 26% in tolterodine group).  
0	4064768	In comparison to oxybutynin (M3 and M1 selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) tolterodine is claimed to have fewer side effects as it targets the bladder more than other areas of the body (10).  
0	4064768	There is a trend for detecting the lowest therapeutic dose of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of overactive bladder in elderly because of 32% reported rate of using other drugs with anticholinergic effects in elderly which leads to cumulative adverse effects (13).
1	2211287	Changes in metabolic rate (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg fat free mass) from the baseline rate did not significantly differ in the underweight (n = 3) or in the overweight subjects (n = 5) following consumption of either meal at any time.
1	2211287	Changes in metabolic rate (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg fat free mass) from baseline were significantly higher in normal weight subjects (n = 11) across all times following consumption of the high protein, high fat meal versus the high protein, low fat meal.  
1	2211287	Similarly, when energy expenditure was expressed as the change in kcal/min/ffm, the overall effect of body mass index was significant (p = 0.0034), with the values for the overweight group significantly greater than the normal weight group which was significantly greater than the underweight group.  
1	2211287	While there was not an effect of meal type in the overweight or underweight groups, the change in energy expenditure was significantly (p = 0.0014) greater in the normal weight group following consumption of the high protein, high fat meal versus following consumption of the high protein, low fat meal.
0	2211287	Significant positive correlations also were found between body mass index and average total change in metabolic rate (r = 0.591; p = 0.008), and between body weight and average total change in metabolic rate (r = 0.464; p = 0.045).  
0	2211287	The difference in the increase in metabolic rate after consumption of the high protein, high fat meal versus the high protein, low fat meal in the normal weight subjects represents about 69.3 kcal per 3.5 hours (1.20– 0.87 kcal/min × 210 min = 69.3 kcal).  
0	2211287	However, when expressed in this manner (representing average energy expenditure over 210 minutes across both treatments), the difference in energy expenditure between overweight (0.025 ± 0.0003 kcal/min/kg fat free mass) and normal weight groups (0.024 ± 0.0002 kcal/min/kg fat free mass) was corrected.
0	2211287	The Restricted or Residual Maximum Likelihood (Residual Maximum Likelihood) method was used to determine the effects of body mass index classification (overweight, normal weight, and underweight), meal type (high protein, low fat and high protein, high fat), time, and their interactions on energy expenditure.
1	3206382	Mean increases in hemoglobin to months 1 and 4 with iron hydroxide polymaltose complex were 1.2 ± 0.9 g/dL and 2.3 ± 1.3 g/dL, respectively, (both P = 0.001 versus baseline) and 1.8 ± 1.7 g/dL and 3.0 ± 2.3 g/dL with ferrous sulfate (both P = 0.001 versus baseline) (n.s.
1	3206382	The percentage of reticulocytes at day 7 was similar with iron hydroxide polymaltose complex (1.41 ± 1.31%) and ferrous sulfate (1.57 ± 1.29%; P = 0.905).
1	3206382	A significant improvement in hemoglobin was observed by month 1 in the iron hydroxide polymaltose complex group (9.5 ± 1.1 g/dL to 10.6 ± 1.0 g/dL, P = 0.001) and the ferrous sulfate group (9.4 ± 1.6 g/dL to 11.2 ± 0.9 g/dL, P = 0.001), with an increase of more than 2 g/dL in both treatment arms by month 4 (iron hydroxide polymaltose complex 11.7 ± 0.8 g/dL, ferrous sulfate 12.4 ± 1.0 g/dL; both P = 0.001 versus baseline).
1	3206382	The increase in serum ferritin level from baseline to month 4 was almost twofold lower in the iron hydroxide polymaltose complex group versus ferrous sulfate (22.7 ± 26.1 μg/mL versus 42.5 ± 62.0 μg/mL, P = 0.001).   
0	3206382	The significantly lower rate of gastrointestinal adverse events seen with iron hydroxide polymaltose complex compared to ferrous sulfate in the current study is in line with earlier clinical experience in children [12] and with the difference in iron absorption patterns.
0	3206382	The patients were evenly distributed between the two treatment groups (iron hydroxide polymaltose complex, n = 52, 49.5%; ferrous sulfate, n = 51, 50.5%).
0	3206382	The rise in nontransferrin bound iron thus is negligible after iron hydroxide polymaltose complex dosing since the size of the hydroxide complex means that there is almost no passive diffusion and the slow release of iron avoids overload of the active transport mechanism [9], but when iron is given in the form of ferrous salts, rapid release of iron means that there is a dose-dependent passive absorption of iron [29].
0	3206382	In children, comparative data are more sparse, but there are reports of fewer gastrointestinal adverse events [12] and less frequent tooth staining [11] in IPC-treated children compared to those given ferrous sulfate.

1	3228981	Compared to baselines in per protocol populations, the reduced abdominal pain/discomfort frequency scores in otilonium bromide and mebeverine were 0.55 ± 1.20 (P = 0.011) and 0.37 ± 1.11 (P = 0.042), respectively, to show similarly reduced scores.
1	3228981	Besides, the improved abdominal pain/discomfort frequency scores at 4th week visit, final alleviations in abdominal pain intensity, flatulence, abdominal bloating and satisfied stool frequency with global assessments filled by both patients and investigators were significantly achieved by both treatments, and otilonium bromide was not inferior to mebeverine in treating these parameters.  
1	3228981	There were no differences in terms of age, gender, body mass index, Irritable bowel syndrome duration, proportions of Irritable bowel syndrome subtypes, abdominal pain/discomfort severity etc.
1	3228981	The mean abdominal pain/discomfort frequency score reduced scores for otilonium bromide and mebeverine were 0.12 ± 1.32 (P = 0.545) and 0.31 ± 1.08 (P = 0.072), respectively, based on intent-to-treat populations without differences between 2 arms.
1	3228981	The net changes of the patient numbers at final evaluation on the abdominal pain/discomfort intensity are illustrated in Table 5.
1	3228981	Overall, the mean reduced intensity scores in otilonium bromide arm were 0.41 ± 0.57 (P < 0.001) and 0.45 ± 0.60 (P < 0.001), and the mean reduced intensity scores in mebeverine arm were 0.33 ± 0.62 (P = 0.001) and 0.30 ± 0.60 (P = 0.004), respectively, based on intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations.
1	3228981	None of the above data showed statistical difference between 2 arms.
1	3228981	Other changes of Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in terms of flatulence, abdominal bloating and satisfied stool frequency are depicted in Table 6.
1	3228981	Briefly, these evaluated bowel symptoms had marked improvement after both treatments, on either intent-to-treat or per-protocol analysis, while the changes in abdominal bloating and satisfied stool frequency were similar in both groups (data were not shown).
0	3228981	Most adverse events were mild to moderate in nature (89.2% in otilonium bromide; 88.7% in mebeverine), whereas 3 subjects (5.1%) in otilonium bromide and 5 subjects (8.6%) in mebeverine were withdrawn owing to the intolerable adverse events.
0	3228981	In addition, otilonium bromide also shows a high affinity in binding to various muscarinic receptor subtypes in terms of M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5, respectively.32,33 Owing to its potent muscarinic blockade, otilonium bromide not only exhibit an antispasmodic but also antisecretory ability through M3 sub-receptor which is abundantly found in human colonic crypt cells to mediate secretion coupled
0	3228981	However, 16 subjects had violated intent-to-treat criteria and only 101 subjects were enrolled in the intent-to-treat population including 49 in otilonium bromide arm and 52 in mebeverine arm.

0	5864139	Longer-term pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiological studies of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors will be required to provide greater insights into the pancreatic safety of this drug class.  
0	5864139	Descriptive statistics from the adjudication process are presented to provide a sense of the nature of these events in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin study.
0	5864139	That said, the finding of other potential etiologies should not provide reassurance that treatment with sitagliptin was perhaps not a contributor, as the alternative hypothesis would be that treatment with sitagliptin magnifies the penetrance of risk factors on pancreatitis development and severity.  
1	2602945	" On-time patients were found to have a longer wait time once in the exam room for the physician than those that were late (14.8 ± 9.2 minutes versus 11.0 ± 8.4 minutes, P = .005); however, those patients spent a significantly longer time with the physician (10.7 ± 6.0 minutes versus 8.9 ± 5.8 minutes, P = .041).
1	2602945	Exam room utilization was lower for late patients (28.9% versus 44.7%, P = .03) with physician utilization lower in clinics with 3 or more late patients when compared to clinics with 2 or fewer (59.7% versus 68.7%, P = .004). 
0	2602945	Despite sending it prior to the visit, we found that only 50% of patients completed this information prior to the visit which, although they were technically on time, made them late arrivals within the confines of the process as they completed the form in the registration area.

1	5452066	In the second randomized stage, median PFS was significantly longer with PM01183: 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.5–5.7 months) versus 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.4–2.8 months) with topotecan (P = 0.0067).
1	5452066	Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.7–19.3 months) with PM01183, and 8.5 months (95% CI, 3.3–15.6 months) with topotecan (P = 0.2871).  
1	5452066	Median PFS was significantly longer with PM01183 versus topotecan for patients with platinum-resistant disease, both in the study as a whole (P = 0.0017) and in the second stage alone (P = 0.0043) (Figure 2B).  
0	5452066	This two-stage phase II trial evaluated PM01183 activity in terms of overall response rate (overall response rate) in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.   
0	5452066	More modest activity was observed in patients with platinum-refractory disease: overall response rate = 10.5%; median OS = 9.3 months.  
0	5452066	In conclusion, PM01183 is an active drug in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer and warrants further clinical development, particularly in platinum-resistant disease, where its activity was remarkable.
1	5200917	Moreover, in a simple speeded response task, no difference was seen in reaction time for either visual or auditory responding on tolcapone compared to placebo (all T(14) ≤ 1.1, p ≥ 0.3), and there was no correlation across individuals between changes in motor responding and changes in impulsive choice ratio on tolcapone (all | r | values ≤ 0.11, p ≥ 0.7).
1	5200917	Finally, no differential changes in blood pressure were seen on tolcapone versus placebo (T(15) = 1.31, p = 0.21), and subjects themselves were unable to distinguish between tolcapone and placebo administration based on confidence ratings (T(16) = 0.98, p = 0.34).  
0	5200917	Moreover, the fact that the significant correlation with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale non-planning subscale was specific to this measure – i.e. the same correlations with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale attention and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale motor subscales were not significant – argues for a neurobiological basis rather than one determined by noise.
0	5200917	Likewise, the above results are broadly consistent with the idea that remediating impulsive behavior in patients with problem and pathological gambling may depend on treatments that normalize function within dopamine-sensitive brain systems (Zack and Poulos, 2009).
1	3757993	The mean number of login attempts of the intervention group mean was 2.64 (foods/snacks per day 3.17, median 2.0) and the control group was 1.63 (foods/snacks per day 2.14, median 1.0).
1	3757993	The difference between intervention and control groups login was statistically significant as expected since the intervention group was asked to set goals (Wilcoxon two-sample test, P=.0003).
1	3757993	Comparing follow-up to baseline score change, the intervention group had a significant reduction in their IHRS score at follow-up (intervention group baseline IHRS: mean 13.4, foods/snacks per day 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 12.1, foods/snacks per day 5.9, P=.002), and a trend was seen in the control group (baseline IHRS: mean 12.6, foods/snacks per day 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 11.7, foods/snacks per day 5.9, P=.05) (see Table 2), though these results were not statistically significant.  
1	3757993	Overall, more than 13.9% (51/367) of participants progressed from inactive (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation) to the active (action, maintenance) stage in diet and physical activity, and 12.5% (46/367) progressed to the active stage in weight loss plans; however, no significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups (Table 6).  
0	3757993	All participants had access to the South Asian HeArt Risk Assessment website that contained health information regarding cardiovascular risk factors from a South Asian perspective [42].
0	3757993	Therefore, there is a need for routine screening of coronary artery disease risk factors in South Asian adults and to develop and test interventions to improve risk factors among South Asians.
0	3757993	The main feedback included: (1) daily messages were too frequent which could potentially lead them to ignore the messages; (2) phone calls to remind participants to login to the study website were too frequent, while others reported that there was not enough in-person contact and would have liked to have a mid-program visit that with more face-to-face contact with the study team; and (3) IHRS and genetic risk score reports should be sent via email and remove the website login component.
0	3757993	Participants usage of the goal setting website was monitored centrally, and for those participants who did not log on to access their risk score reports or for intervention participants who had not set goals 2 weeks from the time they were prompted by email, a study team member attempted to reach them by telephone to encourage them to access their results and set goals.
1	4141382	VAS for sedation on reversal of anesthesia showed the following association: Group CSuNeo = Group CSuNeoAdr < Group CSu = Group CSuAdr = Group IVSu (P < 0.005).

1	5534500	The mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.49 ± 0.85 days vs. 13.31 ± 6.9 days (P < 0.001), the mean time of removal of Nasogastric tubes was 0.77 ± 1.031 days vs. 3.26 ± 2.737 days (P < 0.001), the mean time of successful enteral feeding was 1.89 ± 1.13 days vs. 5.46 ± 1.67 days (P < 0.001), and the mean time for removal of intra-abdominal drains was 2.94 ± 1.056 days vs. 9.06 ± 3.757 days (P < 0.001) for the enhanced and the conventional groups, respectively.
1	5534500	Complications were significantly lower among patients in the enhanced group (25.7% vs. 65.7%) (P = 0.001).
1	5534500	Patients in the enhanced recovery group were compliant to enforced mobilization within 24 hours after surgery (postoperative day 0) while only five patients in the control group were ambulated successfully within that period (P < 0.001).
1	5534500	Similarly, patients in the en-hanced recovery group tolerated earlier oral feeding (fluids) without severe postoperative nausea and vomiting (P < 0.001).

0	3590825	Plantar-flexor Static Stretch Training Effect on Eccentric and Concentric Peak Torque – A comparative Study of Trained versus Untrained Subjects    ABSTRACT. 
1	5295074	Increases in 25(OH)D (median with interquartile range) from baseline to study end were 13.2 (5.9 to 20.7) nmol/L in the 200 international units group, and 35.8 (18.2 to 52.8) nmol/L in the 800 international units group (p < 0.001 for the between group difference).
1	5295074	The primary endpoint defined as the increase in 25(OH)D from baseline to study end was significantly higher in the 800 international units group compared to the 200 international units group (p < 0.001; see Figure 2).  
1	5295074	At 4 weeks, there was already a significant between group difference for the increase in 25(OH)D (p < 0.001).
0	5295074	This recommendation was based on Irish studies by Cashman et al. who showed that during wintertime, a vitamin D intake of 800 international units per day is sufficient to achieve a 25(OH)D level of ≥50 nmol/L in about 90% to 95% of the Irish population [12,13].  
0	5295074	Given that vitamin D status may be modified by intake of hormonal contraceptives, we also evaluated the impact of hormonal contraceptive use on 25(OH)D levels and their increase after vitamin D supplementation [24,25].
0	5295074	This is a single-center, randomized, open trial conducted from 8 January to 9 May 2016 in Esslingen, Germany.
1	4445854	The results of the t-test indicated that storage time only had significant effect on bond strength of Clearfil SE Bond with no epigallocatechin gallate (p= 0.017).

1	3513028	Of 150 patients with pollinosis who were registered, analysis was conducted on 144 patients (62 receiving anti-leukotriene therapy and 82 receiving antihistamine therapy), excluding those with incomplete questionnaires.
1	3513028	In both groups, scores for symptoms of pollinosis and quality of life were low, suggesting that both drugs were effective considering the high pollen levels season (5–9 times higher than the previous year).
1	3513028	This showed that antihistamine therapy was effective for the sneezing/rhinorrhea type and anti-leukotriene therapy was effective for the nasal blockage type, with no difference between the 2 drugs the combined type.
1	3513028	For the nasal blockage type, symptoms and quality of life improved faster with anti-leukotriene than antihistamine therapy from the peak to the end of the pollen season.
1	3513028	When either an anti-leukotriene (pranlukast) or an antihistamine was used for primal therapy of pollinosis, both drugs improved pollinosis symptoms and quality of life.

1	4721471	Intervention participants used fewer health resources both prior to and after enrolment in the study, although no differences were statistically significant (Table 1).
1	4721471	Health Eating and Active Living for Diabetes cost $340 per participant, with nearly 60% related to intervention activities and training of the exercise specialists.
1	4721471	With the exception of the intervention cost, intervention participants incurred less cost in all categories (physician, out- and in-patient costs) compared to the controls during the follow-up period.
1	4721471	The unadjusted mean difference in total cost (intervention plus health care utilization) between groups was insignificant ($4).
1	4721471	However, excluding the intervention cost, average cost per intervention participant would be $336 less than for control patients.
1	4721471	Health Eating and Active Living for Diabetes participants also incurred fewer costs in the pre-enrollment period.
1	4721471	After adjusting for pre-enrolment cost and body mass index, the adjusted incremental cost was $102 (Table 2), although not statistically significant.
0	4721471	The provincial government (Alberta Health) uses a fee-for-service system to pay for physician services, based on a standard schedule.
0	4721471	For health care resource use, only direct costs of physician services, hospital outpatient visits and hospital inpatient admissions were included, since the analysis was conducted from a public payer perspective.
0	4721471	Participants set their own daily step goals (i.e., a prescribed daily step goal such as 10,000 steps/day was not a component of the program) (Johnson et al., 2012).  
0	4721471	The cost estimates of inpatient and outpatient services include drug costs, however, prescription medication costs purchased from community pharmacies were excluded.
0	4721471	As a novel approach, there is no accepted benchmark or threshold, and it is therefore up to the policymaker to determine the societal value of our outcome, appropriate to the setting and population.  
0	4721471	An endorsement letter from each PCN was mailed to the potential participant by staff located at each PCN (Johnson et al., 2012).

1	4477769	In the family-centered care group, the mean score of satisfaction among the parents of the children was 20 out of 90 before the intervention, but, after the family-centered care method was used, it increased to 83.2 out of 90.
1	4477769	In addition, a significant difference was found between the scores of satisfaction for the control and experimental groups (p<0.001), and all parents of children in the experimental group expressed high satisfaction.  
1	4477769	Before intervention, the mean score of parent's educational satisfaction was 7.46±2.801, but, after intervention, the mean score increased significantly to 28.06±1.73.
1	4477769	The results of the paired sample t-test also indicated that psychological support increased significantly from 3.83±1.79 before intervention to 33.86±1.216 after intervention.
0	4477769	This precept fits well with family-centered care, which is "a way of caring for children and their families by providing health services that ensure that care is planned around the whole family, not just the child who is ill.
0	4477769	After the data were encoded, they were analyzed using SPSS version 14 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States of America), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired sample t-tests were used for the analysis.
0	4477769	Accordingly, the satisfaction of families' needs requires a cooperative relationship between families and healthcare workers that reflects mutual trust and respect (11).
0	4477769	Healthcare institutions can be directed and guided into the utilization of the elements of family-centered care, which include mutual respect, support, and participation (18).
1	4584261	There were no statistically significant group differences in levels of depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance (Table 4) at any of the study measurement points (pre-chemotherapy, mid-chemotherapy, and/or two weeks after completion of chemotherapy).

1	4377530	At the end of the study, four cases in the Nelatone group and 12 cases in the Foley group presented with urinary tract infections (P = 0.01).
1	4377530	The Nelatone catheters, compared with the Foley ones, had a lower risk of urinary tract infections in the long term use.
1	4377530	The frequency of entrococcal infection was less in the Nelatone group (3 cases) compared with the Foley group (nine cases) and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.038).
1	4377530	Moreover, three cases of staphylococcal urinary tract infections were observed in the Foley group compared to only one case in the Nelatone group (P = 0.605) (Table 2).  
0	4377530	There are different types of urinary catheterss in terms of their materials, sizes and shapes and each of them is made for a specific purpose.
0	4377530	The most effective way to prevent infection is to limit catheter use and discontinue the catheter when no longer needed.
0	4377530	The first group was catheterized using Nelatone catheter; the second group was catheterized using Foley catheter and the third group was studied without performing any catheterization.
0	4377530	Hosseinpour et al. (16) and Nicolle (13) have also observed no significant difference between silicone and latex catheters regarding the risk of urinary tract infections.
1	4776542	The incidence of Postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly smaller in group MO than group M and group O, while there was no significant difference between group M and group O during the first 24 h postoperatively.
1	4776542	postanesthesia care unit time was not significantly different between the four groups [Table 2].
1	4776542	Postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly less in those patients who received a combination of midazolam and ondansetron as compared to the other groups [Table 3].
1	4776542	Subsequently, the difference was not significant between group M and group O. However, Postoperative nausea and vomiting in both of them were significantly less as compared to group S [Table 3].
1	4776542	The overall patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the group MO compared the other groups [P < 0.001, Table 2].

1	4776542	No significant difference was found between groups in terms of side effects such as dizziness and headache [Table 5].  
0	4776542	In conclusion, our study showed that the prophylactic antiemetic effect of the combination of 0.75 mg/kg midazolam with 4 mg ondansetron was superior to using midazolam or ondansetron singly in the first 24 h after operation.
0	4776542	One hundred forty patients were randomly allocated into four groups, and no patient was excluded.
0	4776542	Patients with previous history of motion sickness, antiemetic therapy within 24h preoperatively, patients on opioid treatment, smokers, and pregnant patients were not included.
0	4776542	We evaluated the incidence of nausea and vomiting and their severity in the first 24 h and the number of patients with nausea and vomiting who used additional antiemetic between 0–2 and 2–24 h.
0	4776542	Extubation time (defined since discontinuation of anesthetic drugs until removal of endotracheal tube) was also recorded.  
0	4776542	These drugs act by two mechanisms: First, by blocking the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius; and second, by blocking peripherally afferent vagal impulses originating from 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract.[27]

1	5604419	The overall and Stages Questionnaire-3 score was not significantly lower in the vitamin-D deficient group [mean difference − 6.54 (95% CI: -16.15 to 3.08)] compared to the vitamin-D non-deficient group.
1	5604419	Vitamin-D deficiency was not associated with stunting nor well as the association between vitamin-D deficiency and physical growth nor underweight at baseline or 6 months later in this population.
1	5604419	None of the neurodevelopment outcomes (Total and Stages Questionnaire-3, sub scales of and Stages Questionnaire-3 i.e. Communication, Gross motor, Fine motor, Problem - solving, Personal- social), nor any of the grwoth outcomes were significantly associated with vitamin D status after 6 months (Not shown in table).  
0	5604419	We also did a sensitivity analysis by classifying baseline vitamin-D status as <10, 11–20, 21–29 and > = 30 ng/mL. 34.6% children were <10, 42.4% were 11–20, 17% were 21–29 and 6% were above 30 ng/ml.

0	5687903	From April 2015 to April 2016, 162 patients (group A = 82 and group B = 80) were studied, of which 53.7% were male.
0	5687903	Randomization code was preserved until time of record analysis of data.
0	5687903	Similarly, in a study conducted on 144 patients with vertigo, Simoncelli et al assessed the symptoms influence in the betahistine examined and showed that the frequency, severity and duration of attacks of vertigo in patients taking betahistine were significantly less, and also the quality of life before and after using the drug significantly improved [14].
0	5687903	The usefulness of these drugs in treating vertigo is due to block histaminergic signals from the vestibular nucleus to the vomiting center in the medulla [8].
1	2360030	Diarrhoea was prevalent in the uracil/tegafur/leucovorin combined with irinotecan arm (16%) vs TEGAFOX (4%).
1	2360030	Hand–foot syndrome (palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia-HFS) was classified as 3 grades: grade 1 (numbness, dysesthesia, painless swelling or erythema not disrupting normal activity); grade 2 (painful erythema with swelling affecting daily living activities); grade 3 (desquamation, ulceration, blistering or severe pain or any symptoms leading to an inability to work or perform daily living activities).  
1	2360030	No HFS was reported in the uracil/tegafur/leucovorin combined with irinotecan group whereas grade 1–2 HFS was evident in 10% of the TEGAFOX group.

1	2360030	In the TEGAFOX arm, six complete remission and 22 partial remission were recorded, corresponding to an overall response rate of 38.9% (95% confidence limit, from 27.6 to 51.1).  
1	2360030	The median duration of response was 6 (range: 3–15) for uracil/tegafur/leucovorin combined with irinotecan and 6 months (range: 3–23) for TEGAFOX group.  
0	2360030	Table 1 shows the main demographic and baseline characteristics that were comparable between treatment arms.
0	2360030	One hundred and forty-three patients with measurable, non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer were randomised in a multicentre study to receive uracil/tegafur/leucovorin combined with irinotecan (UFT 250 mg m−2 day days 1–14, leucovorin 90 mg day days 1–14, irinotecan 240 mg m−2 day 1; q21) or TEGAFOX (UFT 250 mg m−2 day days 1–14, leucovorin 90 mg day days 1–14, oxaliplatin 120 mg m−2 day 1; q21).
0	2360030	All cases who had received at least three cycles of study treatment and had at least one tumour assessment were considered evaluable for activity.

1	3692346	The increase in FEV1 from baseline was greater in the higher-dose group than in the guidelines group, especially during the first month of treatment (304 ± 49 mL versus 148 ± 39 mL, respectively, P = 0.01).
1	3692346	Numbers of patients with completely or well controlled asthma were higher in the higher-dose group than in the guidelines group (92.1% versus 81.1%, respectively, P = 0.03).
1	3692346	Absolute mean changes from baseline in mean Asthma Control Test scores were significantly different between the higher-dose and guidelines groups (8 ± 2 versus 4 ± 2, respectively, P = 0.04) at the end of study; further, the mean number of asthma-free days during the study was greater in the higher-dose group than in the guidelines group (82.4 ± 26.5 days versus 69.2 ± 24.3 days, P = 0.02).  
1	3692346	Daily inhaled corticosteroid consumption in the higher-dose and guidelines groups was not significantly different (736 ± 219.7 μg versus 663.1 ± 267.2 μg, respectively P = 0.17).
1	3692346	Frequently reported side effects were dysphonia (3.2% in the higher-dose group versus 2.8% in the guidelines group, P = 0.63), headache (2.1% versus 2.4%, respectively, P = 0.59), tremor (3.4% versus 3.7%, P = 0.71), and hoarseness of voice (4.2% versus 3.8%, P = 0.51).
0	3692346	Most patients (82%–84%) were classified as having partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma at the time of screening, and a minority (15%–17%) were classified as having uncontrolled asthma with exacerbation.
0	3692346	Third, no inflammatory or molecular parameters, such as eosinophil count, exhaled nitric oxide, or bronchial biopsy, were included as further objective measures of efficacy.  
0	3692346	In a subgroup analysis, the effect of treatment was more marked in patients with partly or uncontrolled asthma, for whom the increase in FEV1 was significantly higher in the higher-dose group than in the guidelines group (239 ± 52 mL versus 98 ± 49 mL, respectively, P < 0.01) at the initial week 4 visit, and this difference was also significant at each subsequent follow-up visit (Figure 3).
0	3692346	Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive higher doses of inhaled corticosteroid (higher-dose group) or to receive the dose suggested by the practice guidelines (guidelines group).

1	4864053	Quantification using parametric modeling is shown in Figure 2 for medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate region, left and right insula, cerebellum, and whole gray matter.
1	4864053	For a composite gray matter region, a one‐sample t‐test showed that l‐dopa was associated with an 11% mean decrease in [11C]Ro15‐4513 BP (t = −2.29, 9 degrees of freedom, P = 0.048).
1	4864053	There was a highly significant effect of regions (linear mixed model, P = 0.000049).

0	4270681	This complication can be appeared as the consequence of small doses of administered anesthetic agents or insufficient anesthetic techniques (5).
0	4270681	BIS-guided management may not be superior to routine monitoring protocols to prevent awareness as well as hemodynamic changes during general anesthesia in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries.  
0	4270681	There were no significant differences between the group with Bispectral monitoring and those with routine management regarding gender and education level (Table 1).
0	4270681	The present study examined whether the awareness rate and changes in vital signs within anesthesia would be lower in patients allocated to BIS-guided management than those allocated to routine monitoring.  
0	4270681	Results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (standard deviation) for quantitative variables and summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.
0	4270681	In a study by Kertai and his colleagues on patients at high risk for intraoperative awareness, they observed no evidence that Bispectral monitoring or the avoidance of prolonged periods of Bispectral values less than 45 improved intermediate-term survival (16).
1	5530334	Of 441 reported match injuries, 168 were sustained to the head/neck (intervention, 82; control, 86), 125 to the upper limb (intervention, 65; control, 60), 113 to the lower limb (intervention, 67; control, 46) and 35 to the trunk (intervention, 19; control, 16).
1	5530334	However, clear effects favouring the intervention programme were noted for head/neck injuries (incidence RR=0.72, 0.51 to 1.01), upper limb injuries (burden RR=0.66, 0.40 to 1.10) and concussion (incidence RR=0.71, 0.48 to 1.05).  
0	5530334	All estimations were made using generalised linear modelling with a Poisson distribution, a log-linear link function and offset for hours of exposure to generate rate ratios (rate ratios) and 90% confidence limits (90% CL) for injury incidence and burden values.

1	5207750	The difference was statistically (P < 0.0001) and clinically significant, with intensive group participants having HbA1c outcomes on average -1.8 (95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2) percentage points lower than conventional group participants.
1	5207750	The primary analysis indicated that participants in the intensive education group had significantly lower HbA1c levels at six-month follow-up compared to participants in the conventional education group, with a mean estimated difference of -1.8 (95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2) in HbA1c percentage points (Table 2).
0	5207750	Diabetes self-management education (Diabetes self-management education) is key to enabling patients to manage their chronic condition and can reduce the occurrence of costly and devastating complications.
0	5207750	The education programme was also designed to be applicable to patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with lifestyle education applicable to both forms of diabetes, but medication-related education specific to both types.
0	5207750	This study demonstrates that an intensive, structured and systematic group-based Diabetes self-management education programme can help patients manage their blood glucose levels more effectively than conventional, ad hoc group-based Diabetes self-management education within a LMIC healthcare setting.
1	5735486	Significantly, less number of patients and less dosage of esmolol were required (P = 0.0040 and 0.0001, respectively) in Group F as compared to that in Group C. Again, number of patients requiring fentanyl and dosage of the same drug was significantly lower in Group F. Dose of propofol for the maintenance of Bispectral index was significantly lower in Group F. However, the duration of controlled hypotension was almost similar in both groups.
1	5735486	Discharge time from Postanesthesia Care Unit and hospital was similar between two groups without any appreciable side effects.  
1	5735486	Again to ensure induced hypotension, dose of esmolol and the number of patients treated with it were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in Group C than F [Table 1].

1	2806387	The intensity of the unpleasant sensation was rated significantly higher after injection of saline from prefilled syringes compared to saline from polyethylene (p = 0.001).  
1	2806387	The intensity of an unpleasant sensation after injection of Becton Dickinson 10 ml over 5 seconds was rated significantly higher compared to regular saline from polyethylene bottles, 10 ml over 5 seconds (p = 0.001), see figure 2.
0	2806387	The volunteers were asked to describe taste and smell after an injection of the two different types of saline (Becton Dickinson and regular saline from polyethylene bottles).
0	2806387	Although the sensation when injected at slower speed, or less volume was lower than with 10 ml over 5 seconds, these differences were not statistical significant compared to an injection of 10 ml Becton Dickinson over 5 seconds.  
1	2864284	At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%).
1	2864284	The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003).
1	2864284	Both regimens were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.  
1	2864284	Patient characteristics at baseline were broadly similar between the two treatment groups (Table 1) except that the median white blood cell count was lower in the chloroquine group compared with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (median 6.0 vs. 6.6 × 109/l respectively, p = 0.02).   
1	2864284	By the end of the 56-day follow-up period, there were 23 recurrences (parasitological failures) in the chloroquine group and 7 in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, giving a day 56 failure rate of 8.9% (95% CI 6.0 - 13.1%) in the chloroquine group and 2.8% (1.4 - 5.8%) in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (Figure 2).
1	2864284	Initial parasitological responses were faster with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Figure 4); in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group 241/264 (91.3%) of patients cleared their parasitaemia at day 1 compared to 209/265 (78.9%) in the chloroquine group (p < 0.001, relative risk of clearance in chloroquine group = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93).
1	2864284	At day 2, the groups were no longer significantly different with 259/265 (97.8%) of the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and 257/265 (97.0%) in the chloroquine group having cleared their parasitaemia (p = 0.59).
1	2864284	In terms of resolution of fever (defined as axillary temperature >
1	2864284	37.0°C) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was again superior (Figure 4), with 29/266 (10.9%) of the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group febrile on day 1 compared to 45/268 (16.8%) in the chloroquine group (p = 0.049).
1	2864284	By day 2 there was no longer a significant difference in the proportion with fever (3/265 (1.1%) for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, 9/264 (3.4%) for chloroquine, p = 0.08).
1	2864284	At day 1, headache was less frequent in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (105/265 (39.6%)) compared to the chloroquine arm (145/266 (54.5%), p = 0.001).  
1	2864284	The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both arms with the first recurrences observed at day 35 in the chloroquine group and day 42 in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group.
1	2864284	Twenty-one of 30 (70%) recurrent parasitaemias were associated with gametocytaemia, with no significant difference between treatment arms in terms of proportion of recurrent patients with gametocytaemia (16/23 and 5/7 for chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine respectively, p = 1.0).  
1	2864284	There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with pruritus in the chloroquine arm compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on days 1, 2 and 3; on day 1, 15/268 subjects in the chloroquine arm had pruritus compared to 2/266 in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (p = 0.002, relative risk 7.44, 95% CI 1.71-32.3), consistent with the known side-effects of chloroquine.
1	2864284	There were no significant differences between the two arms in haemoglobin concentration or occurrence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dl) at any stage during follow-up (all p > 0.5).  
0	2864284	The rapid clearance of parasites in the chloroquine group, and the fact that failures were not seen before day 28, suggest that recrudescences associated with chloroquine-resistance did not contribute significantly to the number of recurrences.
0	2864284	The subjects were seen on days 0 to 3 inclusive and weekly to 56 days, so that late recrudescence and relapses could be detected [23,24].
0	2864284	Rice is cultivated on the plain and malaria is a well-known health problem [21].
0	2864284	Radical treatment with primaquine is not currently recommended because of the risk of oxidant haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency, as testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is not available.
0	2864284	Relatively little data exists for the rest of the country; sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has been shown to have good efficacy against P. falciparum in Kunduz province [11] and molecular studies indicate that P. vivax resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is present at a relatively early stage in Nangarhar and Herat provinces[12].  
0	2864284	For the purpose of evidence-based decision making, and to obtain better information on the effectiveness of available anti-malarial drugs against vivax malaria in Afghanistan, the relative therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in the treatment of vivax malaria was assessed at three sites in Afghanistan.  
0	2864284	Limited access to prompt diagnosis and treatment, self-medication with low quality medicines [7] and non-adherence to the national treatment policy are all potential contributors to drug resistance in Afghanistan.

0	2864284	Giemsa-staining of thick and thin blood films was performed to confirm parasite species and parasitaemia by a standard approximation method (40 × number of parasites per 200 white blood cells on the thick film).
0	2864284	Control measures are confounded by the persistence of dormant hypnozoite stages in the liver, which cause relapses of the infection if radical therapy is not administered.
0	2864284	In endemic areas it is a particular problem of children and pregnant women in whom it is associated with poor outcomes, notably anaemia and low birth weight [3].
0	2864284	Afghanistan's national guidelines recommend chloroquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection, the parasite responsible for the majority of its malaria burden.
0	2864284	Cox regression including age (years), gender, recruitment site, treatment arm, admission haemoglobin level (g/dl), presence of gametocytes and parasitaemia as independent variables was performed to identify possible independent predictors of recurrence, using a stepwise elimination method.  
0	2864284	Patients received either quality-controlled chloroquine (IDA, Netherlands) aiming for a target total dose of 25 mg base/kg in divided doses over three days, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Artekin®, each tablet containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine; Holleypharm, China) aiming for a target total dose of 6/48 mg/kg in divided doses over three days.
0	2864284	Other tests such as peripheral white blood cell count and urine examination were undertaken as indicated to rule out other conditions and investigate possible adverse effects of drugs.

0	4972969	During Time 1, nine on-site support visits were implemented in Arm A.  Using a generalized linear latent and mixed model [42], data on the number of patients per provider were analyzed as continuous dependent variables with main effects for arm, subgroup, time period and their interaction to estimate pre/post differences within each subgroup in each arm and ratios of relative risk (ratios of relative risk) for the effect of on-site support within each subgroup.
1	3944580	A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect for leptin and acyl ghrelin.
1	3944580	However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05).
1	3944580	The data indicated that although acute treadmill exercise resulted in a significant change in acyl ghrelin and leptin levels, it had no effect on plasma obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin levels.  
1	3944580	Two-factor ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (P < 0.05), a main effect of time (P < 0.05) and a trial and time interaction (P < 0.05) for acylated ghrelin and leptin concentrations.
0	3944580	The mechanisms explaining the factors relating to leptin during exercise are not well understood.
0	3944580	Most of the current studies elaborating on the effects of exercise on leptin support this finding [5, 6, 29].
0	3944580	Blood samples for leptin were drawn into red cap tubes and centrifuged after completion of clot formation, and the serum samples were stored at –70°C until the day of the hormone measurements.
0	3944580	The decrease in acylated ghrelin during exercise in our subjects is in agreement with previous research [22, 24], but des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were not examined in these studies.  
1	5587697	Additionally, stress effects varied as a function of impulsivity traits.
1	5587697	Individuals who lacked perseverance (i.e., had difficulty focusing on a difficult or boring task) gambled more after experiencing a loss in the stress condition than did those in the control condition.
1	5587697	Participants experienced significantly more stress, pain and displeasure (stress F(1, 58) = 46.11, p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.44; pain, F(1, 58) = 155.62, p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.73, unpleasant, F(1, 58) = 141.16, p < 0.001, ƞ2 = 0.71) in the stress condition than in the control condition.

0	5587697	Assessing the executive functions would be a valuable addition to the literature, as these functions are important for (i) developing a decision-making strategy, (ii) applying decision-making strategies, and (iii) revising decision-making strategies according to feedback9.  
1	4023937	There were no differences between village groups in diarrhea incidence either reported at the home or presenting to clinic.
1	4023937	There were no differences in oral rehydration solution use between zinc (59.6%) and comparison villages (58.8%).
1	4023937	There was no difference between median zinc concentrations of children in the zinc group (72 μg/dL) and comparison group (73.0 μg/dL, p = 0.87).

0	4023937	Village-Randomized Clinical Trial of Home Distribution of Zinc for Treatment of Childhood Diarrhea in Rural Western Kenya    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND. 
0	4023937	Among zinc users, the median number of days that zinc had been taken was 8.0 in both village groups.
0	4023937	[16] The under-5 mortality ratio was 212 per 1,000 live births in 2008.
0	4023937	Special emphasis was given in training the village reporters that zinc was to treat only diarrhea, and if a child had other symptoms, such as fever or cough, they might also need an antimalarial or antibiotic at the clinic.
1	5916905	After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8 kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsudaISI: −0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06).
1	5916905	Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05).
1	5916905	triglycerides, postprandial and basal insulin sensitivity remained unchanged with both interventions.
0	5916905	Subjects were interviewed about their habitual daily activity and an individual physical activity level between 1.4 (low active) and 1.8 (active) was estimated23.
0	5916905	The impact of regular orange juice intake on the risk for type 2 diabetes is as controversial as its effect on the risk of obesity (for meta-analysis see51).
0	5916905	In addition, increased meal frequency is suggested to be a risk factor for increased energy intake20.
1	2710065	No statistically significant difference was observed between these groups based on the microbiological and clinical parameters.  
1	2710065	No statistical difference was detected regarding age and gender between the groups.
1	2710065	The study groups were comparable regarding urine cultures and clinical parameters.
0	2710065	Additionally, clinical parameters including fever, dysuria, and frequency were evaluated for at least 1 month after the procedure.
0	2710065	A growth of more than 105 microorganisms/ml was regarded as significant bacteriuria.
0	2710065	A Student's t-test and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis.  
1	5268424	These tables show that the Poverty treatment yields a higher score on the general dimension scale of negative affects (referred to as Negative Affects from here onward), compared to the Neutral treatment (p<0.01).
1	5268424	The average score of 21.036 in Negative Affects after watching the Poverty video is significantly larger than a typical baseline average of Negative Affects 14.8 reported by [13].
0	5268424	This questionnaire provides a subjective self-evaluation of the current intensity of a number of specific emotions [13], and allows for the construction of broader indices describing more general affective states.
0	5268424	We operate under the assumption that the emotions induced by longer, more intense, and more personal, exposure to poverty than those we create here would be at least as strong.  
1	4590893	There was a significantly reduced isometric maximum force in the tibialis anterior muscle (P < 0.001) after cooling.
1	4590893	The mean electromyographic amplitude of gastrocnemius medialis muscle was increased after cooling (P < 0.003), indicating that fatigue was induced.
1	4590893	There was a significantly reduced isometric maximum force in tibialis anterior muscle (P < 0.001) after cooling, and the gastrocnemius medialis muscle force difference was not significant (Table 1).  
1	4590893	The mean electromyographic amplitude of gastrocnemius medialis muscle was significantly increased by approximately 400 μV after cooling (P < 0.003).
1	4590893	There was no difference for the tibialis anterior muscles (Table 1).  
1	4590893	We found no differences in the ground reaction forces between pre- and postcooling.
1	4590893	Neither did the third peak of coefficient of friction result in a significant difference (P = 0.851) (Table 2).  
0	4590893	Subjects were requested to abstain from alcoholic beverages and intensive physical exercise 24 hours prior testing.
0	4590893	The body weight was weighed on the force plate in order to normalize the ground reaction forces (N) to the subjects' respective body weights (N).  
0	4590893	It was primarily hypothesized that, as a consequence of cooling the muscles of the lower leg, maximum isometric force would be reduced and changes may occur in the muscle electromyographic recordings.
0	4590893	It has also been reported that muscle fatigue due to high intensity dynamic work developed earlier when the muscle temperature was decreased [10].  
0	4590893	As a result, one may have poor coordination or may even slip and fall.

0	4590893	A recent study by Cè et al. [8] showed that both fatigue and muscle cooling decreased nerve conduction velocity.
1	4281164	The total rabbit antithymocyte globulin administered was similar between groups: induction (single-dose, 5.8±0.9 mg/kg vs. divided-dose, 5.9±0.6 mg/kg; P=0.72) to treat acute tubular necrosis (acute tubular necrosis), delayed graft function (delayed graft function), or poor early renal function (single-dose, 4.1±1.4 mg/kg vs. divided-dose, 2.8±1.8 mg/kg; P=0.15) or cumulative dose (single-dose, 6.2±1.5 mg/kg vs. divided-dose, 6.1±1.2 mg/kg; P=0.85).
1	4281164	Ordinary least-squares regression was not used because in the context of repeated measures, it can fail to recognize significant effects in the model because of faulty estimation of the covariance structure of the data.75 Although more patients in the single-dose group developed ATN-DGF, this trend did not reach statistical significance (P=0.11).
1	4281164	There were significantly fewer deaths among kidney recipients who received single-dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction; causes of patient death are presented in Table S3 (SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B12).
1	4281164	No statistically significant differences were present between induction groups in death-censored or rejection-free graft survival (see Fig. 3A, Banff acute scores; Table S3, SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/B12).  
1	4281164	Composited rabbit antithymocyte globulin infusion complication rates were not statistically different between induction groups.
1	4281164	Thirty-four patients demonstrated serious infectious outcomes among 178 patients (19%), 73% (P<0.001) of these were divided-dose patients.
1	4281164	Frequencies of multiple infections (two or more infectious origins, e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal) were lower among single-dose patients (1 vs. 9; P=0.02).
1	4281164	In a multivariate regression model of infectious complications, single-dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction (P=0.046) and higher 12-month absolute lymphocyte counts (P=0.033) associated with significantly fewer occurrences of severe viral infection (cytomegalovirus infection or disease, BK nephropathy, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder).
0	4281164	The possibility that alternate-day administration of steroids (vs. over 24 hr) might account for the increased incidence of serious infections, multiple infections, and increased infections and mortality observed in the divided dose group is extremely unlikely in that the lymphocyte, CD4, and CD4-CD8 recovery rates that probably cause those outcomes are acutely and chronically influenced by rabbit antithymocyte globulin but not steroid administration.
0	4281164	Univariate Cox hazard analyses of patient mortality resulted in the following:  The six significant covariates were combined into Cox multivariate hazard models and sequentially analyzed for their incremental contributions to LR statistics (the estimation algorithm for hypertension or cardiovascular disease failed because of excessive prevalence).
0	4281164	To maintain the family-wise collective type-1 error rate over all 20 demographic comparisons at 0.05, a Bonferroni critical value adjustment was calculated for the individual tests, none of which were significant.

0	4281164	In contrast to our interim report,36 we now show superior renal function among all patients and deceased donor recipients for 3 years after transplantation.
0	4281164	In an experimental model of kidney reperfusion injury, nuclear factor-kappa B upregulation correlated with the severity of injury, and inhibitors and antagonists of nuclear factor-kappa B had a beneficial effect.63,64 These findings suggest that rabbit antithymocyte globulin may have an impact on early renal allograft inflammation, and that this impact may persist.  
1	4716419	The early discontinuation rates, mainly from serious infections, were significantly higher in Cyclophosphamide group (percentage differences of 16.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 32.4).
1	4716419	At the 12th month, both arms were comparable in terms of complete and partial remission rates (68% Cyclophosphamide and 71% enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium) and times to remission (96 days Cyclophosphamide and 97 days enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium).
1	4716419	Composites of unfavourable outcomes (death, doubling of serum creatinine, non-remission and intolerance to treatment) were 46.9% and 37% in Cyclophosphamide and enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium (risk difference=9.84; p=0.44).  
1	4716419	Of note, the adjusted rate of discontinuation within 6 months was significantly higher in the Cyclophosphamide group (per cent difference 16.90, 95% CI 1.3 to 32.4, p=0.03; adjusted for baseline proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate).   
1	4716419	The percentage of serious fatal and non-fatal infections was, however, higher in the Cyclophosphamide group (15.63% vs 3.7%, the per cent difference adjusted for baseline proteinuria 13.35 (95% CI 0.3 to 26.4), p=0.04).
0	4716419	Concerning infectious risk in those who received three consecutive doses prior to randomisation, Cyclophosphamide was withheld for at least 6 weeks before randomisation.
0	4716419	This study was aimed to compare efficacy and safety between enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium and Cyclophosphamide therapy for difficult-to-treat cases of Lupus nephritis in an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in Thailand.  
0	4716419	Other adverse events included one case of diarrhoea, two of gastro-oesophageal reflux in enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium group, two cases of leucopenia in the Cyclophosphamide group and two episodes of renal flare in each group.   
0	4716419	Fifty-nine patients who had relapsed (36%) or who were resistant to previous Cyclophosphamide treatment (64%) and all who were biopsy-proven class III/IV, were randomised into Cyclophosphamide (n=32) and enteric-coated mycophenolic sodium groups (n=27).

1	3996328	Participants in the traditional group lost a significant amount of lean tissue (P = 0.007) in the nine months after intervention, while participants in the eccentric group did not (P = 0.32).
1	3996328	However, there was a significant (P = 0.007) within-group change in lean for the traditional group, with the lean cross-sectional area at the nine-month follow-up being significantly lower than either the pretraining (P = 0.02) or posttraining (P = 0.05) values.
1	3996328	Neither the eccentric (P = 0.51) nor the traditional (P = 0.15) group demonstrated a significant change in BMI over time.  
1	3996328	Further, the high intermuscular adipose tissue group experienced a parallel lowering (P = 0.03) of their elevated pretraining BMI, while the low intermuscular adipose tissue group's BMI did not change (P = 0.73).

1	5440738	Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−2.21, P=.03).
1	5440738	Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−1.65, P=.10).
1	5440738	Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=−.29, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.19, z=−5.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=−.20, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.07, z=−3.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction.  
0	5440738	Although patients staying in psychotherapy longer is seemingly more costly in the short-term, it is possible that receiving a stronger dose of treatment and having more people complete treatment can improve recovery from depression and reduce associated costs such as losses in productivity and other depression-related societal burdens long-term.

1	3432818	Table 2 shows the comparison of 3 groups at the time of astaxanthin-rich Haematococcus pluvialis extract administration, and Table 3 shows the mean response time of all 5 CogHealth tasks and the mean accuracy of 2 tasks—'working memory' and 'delayed recall'—at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of astaxanthin-rich Haematococcus pluvialis extract administration.
1	3432818	The 3 groups did not significantly differ.
1	3432818	However, the changes in response time were as follows: in the high-dosage group, improvement trends were observed for 'choice reaction' (451.1 ± 56.7 vs 480.1 ± 77.5), 'delayed recall' (818.3 ± 195.9 vs 880.1 ± 189.4), and 'divided attention' (385.3 ± 72.5 vs 419.4 ± 79.6), each p values <0.1 at 12 weeks, and 'working memory' was significantly improved (609.2 ± 123.5 vs 655.9 ± 136.5; p<0.05) at 12 weeks; improvement trends were observed for 'working memory' (644.6 ± 124.7 vs 686.0 ± 148.9; p<0.1) at 12 weeks in the placebo group and 'delayed recall' (844.4 ± 103.8 vs 912.2 ± 145.6; p<0.1) at 8 weeks in the low-dosage group.

0	3432818	Effects of astaxanthin-rich     ABSTRACT. 
0	3432818	In recent years, the effect of Astaxanthin against aging and against illnesses related to oxidisation stress has been confirmed by its use in cosmetics and whitening products and in the treatment of fatigue and cancer.(3,4) Astaxanthin exhibits immunomodulation properties;(5,6) alleviates eye fatigue;(7) and prevents Helicobacter pylori infection,(8) metabolic syndrome,(9) and atopic dermatitis.(10)  Due to its high consumption of glucose and oxygen, the brain tends to produce active oxygen and free radicals even though it is composed of substances that are easily oxidisable, such as unsaturated fatty acids and catecholamine.
1	4431324	The infliximab group accumulated higher drug and healthcare costs (€27 487 vs €10 364; adjusted mean difference €16 956 (95% CI 14 647 to 19 162)), while productivity losses did not differ (€33 804 vs €29 220; €3961 (95% CI −3986 to 11 850)), resulting in higher societal cost compared to the conventional group (€61 291 vs €39 584; €20 916 (95% CI 12 800 to 28 660)).

1	4569275	With the additional 1286 person years of 503-S follow-up, the estimated hazard ratio over Phambili and HVTN 503-S follow-up was 1.52 (95% CI 1.08–2.15, p = 0.02, 82 vaccine/54 placebo infections).
1	4569275	The hazard ratio was significant for men (hazard ratio = 2.75, 95% CI 1.49, 5.06, p = 0.001) but not for women (hazard ratio = 1.12, 95% CI 0.73, 1.72, p = 0.62).  
1	4569275	In the combined Phambili and HVTN 503-S follow-up periods, significantly more HIV-1 infections were detected amongst vaccinees (n = 82) as compared to placebo (n = 54); the annualized HIV-1 incidence rate was 4.7% (95% CI 3.7%-5.8%) for vaccinees and 3.0% (95% CI 2.3%-3.9%) for placebo recipients (p = 0.01, Fig 1, table 2).
1	4569275	The effect on HIV-1 acquisition by vaccination status was more pronounced in men [hazard ratio = 2.75, 95% CI: (1.49, 5.06)], and less for women [hazard ratio = 1.12, 95% CI: (0.73, 1.72)], Fig 2.
1	4569275	Most participants reported no change in frequency of sex (75.4%), number of sexual partners (79.7%) or condom use (78.8%) between the year before and year after their last Phambili visit (table 5).
1	4569275	There were no differences in these self-reported risk behaviors by Phambili treatment group (table 5) or follow-up status (data not shown).
1	4569275	Women were more likely than men to report no change (table 5).
1	4569275	Borderline differences between treatment groups were seen for men with number of partners (p = 0.054), with placebo recipients more likely to report an increase in number of partners (16.4%) than vaccinees (6.9%) and for women, placebo recipients more likely to report a decrease in condom use (17.0%) than vaccinees (6.1%) (p = 0.052).

1	4701161	Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid supplementation increased total retinol in plasma, liver and lung, with a dose-by-dose accumulation in neonatal liver and lung, while transcripts for lecithin:retinol acyltransferase in liver, megalin in kidney, Cyp26A1/B1 in liver and lung, respectively, and Stimulated by retinoic acid 6 in lung, were all increased, suggesting pathways of Vitamin A uptake, storage and retinoic acid oxidation were each augmented after Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid.
1	4701161	Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid decreased hepatic expression of Rbp4, responsible for Vitamin A trafficking from liver to plasma, and, in lung, of Raldh-1 and Raldh-2, which function in retinoic acid production.
1	4701161	After Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid supplementation, Stimulated by retinoic acid 6 expression increased significantly at each age (Fig 3A; blue bars); however, the magnitude of increase decreased negative trend with age (postnatal < 0.0001 for Vitamin A-Retinoic Acid).

1	2755038	The secondary outcome (≥50% restenosis) also occurred more frequently in the endovascular arm than in the surgery arm (109 vs 59; adjusted hazard ratio 2·58, 95% CI 1·87–3·55; p<0·0001).
1	2755038	Of the patients who were assigned to endovascular treatment, the risks of 70% or more restenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 0·43, 0·19–0·97; p=0·04) and 50% or more restenosis (0·37, 0·21–0·62; p=0·0003) were significantly lower in those patients treated with a stent than in those treated by angioplasty alone (table 4, figure 2).  
1	2755038	The incidence of ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke or transient ischaemic attack was significantly higher in patients with 70% or more restenosis that was diagnosed within the first year after treatment compared with those who had less than 70% restenosis in the first year.
0	2755038	In three patients without 70% or more restenosis in the first year who had an ipsilateral cerebrovascular event, carotid duplex ultrasound done after the event detected severe restenosis.

0	2755038	10 of 52 patients (cumulative 5-year incidence 22·7%) with 70% or more restenosis had subsequent ipsilateral cerebro-vascular events compared with 35 of 344 patients (10·9%) with less than 70% restenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 2·18, 95% CI 1·04–4·54; p=0·04; table 5, figure 3).
1	4164149	Using a per-protocol analysis, which included all patients who received an embryo transfer (Prolutex = 392; Endometrin = 390), the ongoing pregnancy rate per retrieval for subcutaneous versus vaginal progesterone was 41.6 versus 44.4%, with a difference between groups of −2.8% (95% confidence interval −9.7, 4.2), consistent with the non-inferiority of subcutaneous progesterone for luteal phase support.
1	4164149	In addition, rates of initial positive β-hCG (56.4% subcutaneous versus 59.0% vaginal; 95% confidence interval −9.5, 4.3), clinical intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity (42.6 versus 46.4%; 95% confidence interval −10.8, 3.2), implantation defined as number of gestational sacs divided by number of embryos transferred (33.2 versus 35.1%; 95% confidence interval −7.6, 4.0), live birth (41.1 versus 43.1%; 95% confidence interval −8.9, 4.9) and take-home baby (41.1 versus 42.6%; 95% confidence interval −8.4, 5.4) were comparable.
1	4164149	No statistically significant differences between Prolutex and Endometrin were seen for any of the secondary efficacy variables, including rates of initial positive serum β-hCG, clinical pregnancy at 6–7 weeks of gestation, live birth, take-home baby, implantation, biochemical pregnancy loss or early pregnancy loss, irrespective of the study cohort evaluated (Table III).
1	4164149	The numbers of women who achieved clinical pregnancy were 163 in the Prolutex group and 173 women in the Endometrin group.
1	4164149	The take-home baby rate per embryo transfer (the most important outcome measure from the patient's perspective) for Prolutex versus Endometrin was 41.1 versus 42.6% (P = 0.72) in the per-protocol population.
1	4164149	Implantation rate was defined as the number of gestational sacs divided by the number of embryos transferred for each individual patient then averaged.
1	4164149	There was no statistically significant difference for any comparison between groups.
0	4164149	Moreover, treatment assignment could not have influenced outcome for those patients with regard to embryo availability for embryo transfer because Prolutex and Endometrin were administered only after oocyte retrieval, and any patient discontinuing progesterone due to issues related to product safety or tolerability after treatment initiation was included in the per-protocol cohort as treatment failures.
0	4164149	The mean rFSH stimulatory dose (as a percentage of total dose) for non-pregnant versus pregnant women was 66.6 versus 61.8%, whereas the mean human menopausal gonadotrophin dose (as a percentage of total dose) for non-pregnant versus pregnant women was 30.6 versus 34.1%, indicating that women in this study were more likely to become pregnant if a higher percentage of human menopausal gonadotrophin and a lower percentage of rFSH were utilized in the stimulatory phase of the in vitro fertilization cycle.

1	5426394	The lowest pain score was obtained for oxymetazoline+lidocaine (P<0.05) (Fig. 4).
1	5426394	There were no differences in pain between NS+lidocaine and NS+NS (P>0.05).  
1	5426394	Duration of endoscopy was significantly shorter for oxymetazoline+lidocaine compared to the other spray combinations (P<0.05), and there were no differences between the other combinations (P>0.05) (Fig. 5).  
1	5426394	There were no differences in Mean blood pressures or pulse rate for the other spray combinations (Figs. 6, 7).  
0	5426394	The discomfort caused by lidocaine was significantly higher than that caused by the other sprays (P<0.001).
0	5426394	Some physicians avoid using premedication for Nasal endoscopy because of its systemic effects.
0	5426394	We confirmed that lidocaine spray is very uncomfortable for patients.
0	5426394	These features make lidocaine sprays uncomfortable for the patients [5,6].

0	5426394	Premedication Methods in Nasal Endoscopy: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind Study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES. 
1	3220090	The changes from baseline to 6 months were significant in both the groups for probing depth, clinical attachment level, and recession height; however, for parameters such as recession width, height of the keratinized tissue, and thickness of keratinized tissue significance was seen only in the experimental group.
1	3220090	On comparison between two groups, only thickness of keratinized tissue showed statistically significance.
1	3220090	It can be concluded that the amount of root coverage obtained with acellular dermal matrix allograft + coronally positioned flap was superior compared to coronally positioned flap alone.  
1	3220090	However, on comparison between the test and control group, only thickness of keratinized tissue parameter showed statistically significant result, indicating that acellular dermal matrix has significantly contributed to the thickness in the test group.  
0	3220090	Table 1 Pre- and post-operative changes and comparison between test and control groups   There was statistical significant reduction in probing depth, recession height, recession width and an increase in clinical attachment level gain, height of the keratinized tissue, and thickness of keratinized tissue for the test group.
0	3220090	Therefore, an acellular dermal matrix allograft has been used as an alternative source of donor tissue.
0	3220090	The recession width and height of the keratinized tissue were statistically significant only in test and results between the groups for these parameters were not statistically significant.
0	3220090	The patients were consecutively selected from the out-patient department (out-patient department) of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, who visited the department with the complaint of gingival recession at the sites selected for the study.
1	5122106	At the end of the study, participants had a significant weight loss (2.96 ± 1.6 kg, P < 0.001) that was slightly more in the case group (3.15 ± 1.5 kg vs. 2.75 ± 1.7, P = 0.375).
1	5122106	Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 ± 6.7 cm, P < 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004).
1	5122106	Similarly, abdominal fat thickness decreased significantly in the participants (2.3 ± 1.1 cm, P < 0.001), although changes were not significantly different between two groups (2.53 vs. 2.04 cm, P = 0.139).  
1	5122106	There was no severe drug reaction or other complications due to Arnebia euchroma ointment.  
0	5122106	We used t-test for comparing parametric variables between groups, paired t-test for changes from baseline to final, and repeated measure ANOVA for changes at different steps.  
0	5122106	Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 ± 6.7 cm, P < 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004).
0	5122106	Whether Arnebia euchroma ointment beside decrease of Abdominal circumference and fat thickness will result in better clinical outcome for the obese people or not should be investigated in long-term studies.

1	5301372	The most frequently reported adverse events (occurring in ≥3% of patients) leading to discontinuation were diarrhea (6.4% vs 0%), alanine aminotransferase increase (4.3% vs 2.0%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (4.3% vs 2.0%), and rash (4.3% vs 0%) (Additional file 2: Table S2).
1	5301372	A total of four on-treatment deaths were reported (two deaths in each treatment arm); of the two on-treatment deaths that occurred in the dovitinib arm, one patient died as a result of breast cancer progression and one patient died because of a pulmonary embolism suspected to be related to study treatment.
0	5301372	Conducting clinical trials in molecularly selected patient populations is challenging, particularly because the screening failure rate is high with current trial designs [49], accrual can be slow when the molecular aberration is very rare, and patient dropout rates [50] and costs [51] can be high.

0	5301372	Second, we cannot exclude that dovitinib had an effect regardless of fibroblast growth factor pathway amplification status, given that the number of events for the full study population was 64 (30 in the dovitinib arm and 34 in the placebo arm), which was less than the 90 planned events.
0	5301372	Radiographic assessments (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or radiography) were performed at screening, on day 5 of weeks 8 and 16, before fulvestrant administration every 8 weeks for the remainder of study treatment, and at the end of treatment (if not assessed within 8 weeks before visit).
1	5654157	In terms of overall survival, the median overall survival was 39.3 months (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 83.3) versus 31.2 months (95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 90.2) for arm A vs. arm B (p=0.442) and 16.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3.8 to 28.9) versus 25.3 months (95% confidence interval, 20.8 to 29.8) for arm C vs. arm D (p=0.050) (S4 Fig.).
1	5654157	There was a trend towards longer overall survival in the EGFR-mutant groups than the epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type or unknown groups: median overall survival, 39.3 months (95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 89.6) versus 22.1 months (95% confidence interval, 16.0 to 28.1), respectively (p=0.081) (S5 Fig.).
1	5654157	Of the 44 treatment failures, the rates of loco-regional failure and distant failure were 36.3% and 47.7%, respectively.
1	5654157	Among distant failure sites, lung and brain were the two most common.
1	5654157	There was no significant difference in loco-regional or distant failure rates among the four arms.
1	5654157	In the EGFR-mutant groups, the locoregional and distant failure rates were 27.3% and 63.3%, respectively, while they were 39.4% and 42.4% in the epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type or unknown groups (p=0.463).
0	5654157	The daily dose of 2.4 Gy was composed of 1.8 Gy to planning target volume and a concomitant boost dose of 0.6 Gy to gross tumor volume, with a field border defined as GTV+1-1.5 cm for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and planning gross tumor volume as GTV+8-10 mm considering set-up error and internal motion for intensity modulated radiotherapy.  
0	5654157	These results were consistent with those of other previous randomized phase II studies [28], suggesting that upfront concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy may be superior to chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy when both treatment strategies can achieve high completion rate.
0	5654157	This randomized phase II study demonstrated that this treatment approach is feasible and well tolerated in this population.
0	5654157	However, these results need to be confirmed in large randomized studies.  
0	5654157	Adverse events were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver.
0	5654157	Earlier randomized trials that reported inferior outcomes for induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (radiotherapy) utilized old chemotherapeutic agents such as vinblastine, vindesine, and mitomycin [4,5].

1	3074545	The adjusted difference in the total Composite Abuse Scale score from baseline was greater in the mentored compared with the non-mentored arm (Adj Diff = -8.67, range -16.2 to -1.15), but the evidence for this difference was weaker after propensity scores adjustment.
1	3074545	Observed reduction in depression mean scores from 15.0 to 8.9 in the intervention arm compared favourably with non-mentored women (12.9 to 9.9), but the adjusted difference (adjusted difference) of -1.90, 95% CI -4.12 to 0.32, did not reach conventional statistical significance.
1	3074545	There were no significant differences in use of health care services between groups over the 12 month follow-up period.
0	3074545	All findings were consistently in favour of the intervention arm, and the lack of stronger evidence for the differences may be due in part to the smaller than anticipated numbers of participants, resulting in reduced power to detect small, but meaningful differences.
0	3074545	There was weak evidence for a difference between the intervention and comparison arms in general wellbeing improvements at follow-up, while mean adjusted differences on both the Mental and Physical Components Scores (mental component score and PCS) favoured the intervention arm.  
0	3074545	Only one outcome (mean Composite Abuse Scale score differences) provided evidence of a true difference in abuse values.

1	4220866	In the ITT analysis, previous results showed no difference between LPV/r and NVP treatment arms at W96 except a higher proportion of virologic failure (virologic failure) in patients on NVP-based regimens.
1	4220866	W144 ITT analysis showed a significant difference on endpoints between LPV/r (94/216) and NVP (111/209)(p=0.0479) and persistence of a significant difference in virologic failure rate (20/216 vs 37/209 for LPV/r and NVP, respectively)(p= 0.015).

1	3382640	The results showed that caffeinated coffee significantly reduced standard deviation of lateral position as compared to decaffeinated coffee, both in the first (p = 0.024) and second hour (p = 0.019) after the break.
1	3382640	Similarly, the standard deviation of speed (p = 0.024; p = 0.001), mental effort (p = 0.003; p = 0.023), and subjective sleepiness (p = 0.001; p = 0.002) were reduced in both the first and second hour after consuming caffeinated coffee.
1	3382640	However, both in the first (F(1,23) = 5.8; p = 0.024) and in the second hour (F(1,23) = 6.4; p = 0.019) after the break, caffeinated coffee significantly reduced SDLP.Fig.

0	3382640	Subjects indicated that the mental effort needed to perform the test after caffeinated coffee was significantly reduced in the third (F(1,23) = 11.4; p = 0.003) and fourth hour of driving (F(1,23) = 5.9; p = 0.023).
0	3382640	These findings are in agreement with the pharmacokinetic profile of caffeine (Tmax ≈ 30 min; T1/2 > 2 h), as well as with the known actions of caffeine as a sleepiness countermeasure with the ability to restore performance to baseline.  
0	3382640	It reaches its peak plasma concentration within 15 to 120 min after intake (Arnaud 1987), averaging around 30 min (O'Connell and Zurzola 1984; Blanchard and Sawers 1983).

1	4754570	All groups showed greater microleakage at the gingival in comparison to the incisal margin and the differences were significant among groups with transillumination (P<0.001).
1	4754570	No significant differences were observed in the microleakage scores at the gingival and incisal margins in any of the interfaces (P>0.05).
1	4754570	All groups showed microleakage at the incisal and gingival margins; but in comparison between conventional and transillumination groups, significant differences were observed only between incisal and gingival margins in the transillumination group (P<0.001).  
1	4754570	When direct illumination and transillumination were compared as the two methods of curing, the amount of microleakage was significantly higher at the gingival margins compared to the incisal margins in both interfaces in the transillumination group irrespective of the method of enamel preparation (P<0.05).  
0	4754570	The first method included the use of 37% phosphoric acid gel (Unitek, Monrovia, CA) for enamel conditioning and Transbond XT primer (3M, Unitek, Monrovia, CA) as a sealant.
0	4754570	These lesions occur in about 45% of orthodontic patients [4] and according to a previous study, they have a higher incidence in males [8].
0	4754570	As concluded by Heravi et al, to achieve an acceptable bracket bond strength to the posterior teeth, doubling the curing time from 40 to 80 seconds and increasing the light intensity to 800 mW/cm2 during the transillumination technique should be done [18].  
0	4754570	Also, in 2013 Kumar et al. showed that even though the amount of light intensity lost in transillumination technique was significant, there were no differences in the shear bond strength of brackets bonded by transillumination technique or conventional method of curing at the mesial and distal margins [17].  
1	1261533	In both groups, the polymerase chain reaction adjusted cure rates by day 42 were high: 98.8% (95% CI 96.4, 99.6%) for artemether-lumefantrine and 96.3% (95% CI 93.1, 98.0%) for artesunate-mefloquine.
1	1261533	Both regimens were very well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed attributable to either combination.  
1	1261533	There was no difference in fever clearance times between the two treatment groups (Figure 1).
1	1261533	The mean (SD) decrease in haematocrit value at day seven from baseline was greater in the group receiving MAS3 than in the artemether-lumefantrine group group: 9.3% (SD,11.5%; 95% CI, 7.7% to 10.9%) compared with 6.7% (SD, 11.4%; 95% CI, 5.1 to 8.3%) respectively (P = 0.023).  
1	1261533	During the 42-day follow-up period, 27 new P. falciparum infections occurred among artemether-lumefantrine and 24 among artesunate-mefloquine recipients (P > 0.05) (Table 2).
1	1261533	The PCR-adjusted cure rates by day 42 were 98.8% (95% CI, 96.4% to 99.6%) in the artemether-lumefantrine group group and 96.3% (95% CI, 93.1% to 98.0%) in the MAS3 group (P = 0.08).
1	1261533	There were significantly fewer cases of vivax malaria in the MAS3 group (29 of 227) than in the artemether-lumefantrine group group (90 of 225) (P < 0.001).
1	1261533	Overall, there were less adverse events in artemether-lumefantrine group group compared to MAS3, though the differences were not statistically significant.  
0	1261533	The trial was an open-label, two-arm, randomized study comparing artemether-lumefantrine and mefloquine-artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria with 42 days of follow up.
0	1261533	All adverse events, including those probably related to malaria, were recording and compared among treatment groups.
0	1261533	However, resistance to mefloquine and/or to lumefantrine, would compromise both combinations.
0	1261533	Early diagnosis and treatment with an artemisinin-based drug combination of very high efficacy that reduces gametocyte carriage, has led to a marked decline in the incidence of falciparum malaria and a reversal of the previous trend toward increasing mefloquine resistance [18].
0	1261533	The primary therapeutic outcome measure in this study was the incidence of microscopically and genotypically confirmedrecrudescent infections in both treatment groups by day 42.
0	1261533	Patients with uncomplicated recrudescent infections were re-treated with artesunate, 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days; patients >8 years oldalso received doxycycline, 4 mg/kg/day for 7 days.

0	5003869	The reasons for deviating from guidelines by pharmacists can be patient related (e.g., the patient is unable to visit the pharmacy, there are language problems, or the patient has low health literacy skills).
0	5003869	Guidelines recommend counseling by pharmacists to improve medication adherence, especially at the start of therapy (1997; Puspitasari et al., 2009; Blom and Krass, 2011; van Hulten et al., 2011; Mendys et al., 2014).

0	5003869	It has several advantages: first of all patient may be more comfortable when approached in their own environment where (lack) of privacy is not an issue.
0	5003869	Reasons for not including a selected patient were also registered.  
0	5003869	In patients starting with bisphosphonates, the mean adherence rate in intervention arm (75.2%) was not different from the usual care arm (73.3%) neither was the proportion of adherent patients (70.2% respectively 67.1%).
0	5003869	No effect for on adherence in patients initiating antidepressants was found.  
0	5003869	The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
0	5003869	Health care providers (Health care providers) including pharmacists can reduce these barriers and thereby promote adherence (van Dulmen et al., 2007; Blom and Krass, 2011; van Hulten et al., 2011).
0	5003869	Reasons can also be pharmacy or health system related (e.g., the pharmacy is understaffed, there is no priority for counseling, there is a lack of privacy or lack of remuneration).
1	5832511	Significant differences were only observed for the CD4 counts with higher counts for the groups that received antiretroviral.
1	5832511	For iron, no interactions by treatment (antiretroviral and lipid‐based nutrient supplement) or with treatment and time point and/or first time point were significant indicating that the effects of antiretroviral and lipid‐based nutrient supplement at 2, 6, and 24 weeks were not different from each other (Table S2).
1	5832511	antiretroviral by time point by first time point interactions were significant for copper (p = .034), whereas antiretroviral by first time point interactions were significant for zinc (p = .031).
1	5832511	The mixed model analysis for copper and zinc at 2, 6, and 24 weeks showed that antiretroviral treatment significantly and negatively affected milk copper and zinc concentrations (p = .044 and p = .014) but only at the initial 2 weeks time point.

1	5852865	In this study, we compared the changes in macular pigment over a 24-week supplementation period for two groups of 24 subjects each assigned to either of two supplement formulations, 20 mg/day of lutein or 20 mg equivalent free carotenoids of a combination of diacetate esters of the macular carotenoids.
1	5852865	The latter group responded with a larger increase (0.0666 ± 0.0481) in macular pigment optical density than the former group (0.0398 ± 0.0430), driven largely by the older subjects.
1	5852865	There was a general trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for those subjects whose baseline value was high.
1	5852865	However, the trend was only significant (p < 0.05) for subjects in the diacetate group.
1	5852865	Using two-tailed Student's t-test, we found a significant difference when comparing the change in macular pigment optical density for the two groups (p=0.0287).  
0	5852865	The results are shown in Table 5 and indicate that the change in macular pigment optical density was greater for both old and young subjects in Group 1 compared with Group 2, but the difference in macular pigment optical density response was significant (∗) only for the older subjects (p=0.025).  
0	5852865	Presupplementation macular pigment optical density was lower for the female subjects in the combined groups compared with the males but did not quite reach statistical significance.
