0	5778152	A prospective randomized phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the time course effects of toremifene (toremifene) and letrozole (letrozole), as adjuvant hormone therapy, on serum lipid profiles and bone metabolism in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, postmenopausal breast cancer patients.
0	5778152	Fifty-four postmenopausal breast cancer patients [estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, T1–2, node metastases (n = 0–3), M0] who had undergone curative resection were enrolled.
0	5778152	They were randomized to receive either toremifene 40 mg/day or letrozole 2.5 mg/day as adjuvant hormone therapy.
0	5778152	Serum lipids and bone markers were measured prior to, and again at 6, 12, and 24 months after initiation of treatment.
0	5778152	Changes in serum lipids and bone markers were compared.
0	5778152	Serum levels of total cholesterol (total cholesterol) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were decreased compared with the baseline values at 6 months in 6.5 and 14.0% of patients, respectively, receiving toremifene.
0	5778152	Lipid levels did not change in patients administered letrozole.
1	5778152	Significant differences were observed in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol between the two groups at 12 and 24 months.
0	5778152	In the toremifene group, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) was decreased by 25.0% at 12 months, and serum cross-linked N-telopeptide of type-I collagen (NTx) was decreased by 13.6% at 6 months, and these reductions were maintained for at least 24 months.
0	5778152	In contrast, in the letrozole group, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase did not change and NTx was increased by 16.0% at 6 months and by 18.6% at 24 months, as compared with the baseline.toremifene and letrozole exert different effects on serum lipid profiles and bone metabolism markers.
0	5778152	The effects of toremifene, as adjuvant hormone therapy, on both lipids and bone metabolism in postmenopausal breast cancer patients are superior to those of letrozole.
0	3611754	OBJECTIVE: The ideal solution for fluid management during neurosurgical procedures remains controversial.
0	3611754	The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 7.2% hypertonic saline - 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HS-HES) solution and a 6% hydroxyethyl starch (hydroxyethyl starch) solution on clinical, hemodynamic and laboratory variables during elective neurosurgical procedures.  
0	3611754	METHODS: Forty patients scheduled for elective neurosurgical procedures were randomly assigned to the HS-HES group or the hydroxyethyl starch group.
0	3611754	After the induction of anesthesia, patients in the HS-HES group received 250 mL of HS-HES (500 mL/h), whereas the patients in the hydroxyethyl starch group received 1,000 mL of hydroxyethyl starch (1000 mL/h).
0	3611754	The monitored variables included clinical, hemodynamic and laboratory parameters.
1	3611754	Chictr.org: ChiCTR-TRC-12002357 RESULTS: The patients who received the HS-HES solution had a significant decrease in the intraoperative total fluid input (p<0.01), the volume of Ringer's solution required (p<0.05), the fluid balance (p<0.01) and their dural tension scores (p<0.05).
1	3611754	The total urine output, blood loss, bleeding severity scores, operation duration and hemodynamic variables were similar in both groups (p>0.05).
1	3611754	Moreover, compared with the hydroxyethyl starch group, the HS-HES group had significantly higher plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride, increasing the osmolality (p<0.01).  
0	3611754	CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HS-HES reduced the volume of intraoperative fluid required to maintain the patients undergoing surgery and led to a decrease in the intraoperative fluid balance.
0	3611754	Moreover, HS-HES improved the dural tension scores and provided satisfactory brain relaxation.
0	3611754	Our results indicate that HS-HES may represent a new avenue for volume therapy during elective neurosurgical procedures.
0	5852732	Background: The GReat-Child Trial was a quasi-experimental intervention that has emphasized whole grain as a strategy to manage childhood obesity.
0	5852732	Methods: Two schools in Kuala Lumpur with similar demographic characteristics were assigned as intervention (IG) and control (CG).
0	5852732	Eligibility criteria were overweight/obese children aged 9 to 11 years who had no serious co-morbidity.
0	5852732	Children who reported consuming wholegrain foods in their 3-day diet-recall during screening were excluded.
0	5852732	A total of 63 children (31 IG; 32 CG) completed the entire intervention program.
0	5852732	The IG children underwent six 30-min nutrition education lessons and had school delivery of wholegrain food on a daily basis over a 12-week period.
0	5852732	Parents of IG children attended 1-h individual diet counseling.
0	5852732	Anthropometric outcomes including BMI-for-age z-score (BMI-for-age z-score), body fat percentage and waist circumference were measured at baseline [T0], post-intervention [T1] (3rd month) and follow-up [T2] (9th month).
1	5852732	Results: IG showed significantly lower BMI-for-age z-score (weighted difference: −0.12; 95% CI: −0.21, −0.03; p = 0.009), body fat percentage (weighted difference: −2.6%; 95% CI: −3.7, −1.5; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (weighted difference: −2.4 cm; 95% CI: −3.8, −1.0; p = 0.001) compared to CG.
0	5852732	IG reported significantly lower body fat percentage (weighted difference: −3.4%; 95% CI: 1.8, 5.0; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (weighted difference: −2.1 cm; 95% CI: −3.7, −0.5; p = 0.014) at T1 compared to T0.
0	5852732	Conclusions: The GReat-Child Trial made a positive impact in managing childhood obesity.
0	5852732	It can be incorporated into childhood obesity intervention programs that are being implemented by the policy makers.
0	4734812	Background Hypertension affects 30% of adults worldwide.
0	4734812	Garlic supplements have shown promise in the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension, and the mechanism of action is biologically plausible.
0	4734812	Our trial is the first to assess the effect of aged garlic extract on central blood pressure and arterial stiffness, regarded as important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity.  
0	4734812	Subjects and methods A total of 88 general practice patients and community members with uncontrolled hypertension completed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 12 weeks investigating the effect of daily intake of aged garlic extract (1.2 g containing 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine) or placebo on blood pressure, and secondary outcome measures of central-hemodynamics and other cardiovascular markers, including cholesterol, homocysteine, platelet function, and inflammatory markers.  
1	4734812	Results Mean blood pressure was significantly reduced by 5.0±2.1 mmHg (P=0.016) systolic, and in responders by 11.5±1.9 mmHg systolic and 6.3±1.1 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo (P<0.001).
1	4734812	Central hemodynamic-measures tended to improve in the garlic group more than in the placebo group, including central blood pressure, central pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, augmentation pressure, pulse-wave velocity, and arterial stiffness.
1	4734812	While changes in other cardiovascular markers did not reach significance due to small numbers in subgroups with elevated levels, trends in beneficial effects of garlic on the inflammatory markers TNFα, total cholesterol, low-density lipid cholesterol, and apolipoproteins were observed.
0	4734812	Aged garlic extract was highly tolerable and acceptable, and did not increase the risk of bleeding in patients on blood-thinning medication.  
0	4734812	Conclusion Our trial suggests that aged garlic extract is effective in reducing peripheral and central blood pressure in a large proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and has the potential to improve arterial stiffness, inflammation, and other cardiovascular markers in patients with elevated levels.
0	4734812	Aged garlic extract was highly tolerable with a high safety profile as a stand-alone or adjunctive antihypertensive treatment.
0	59610	Venous thromboembolism is a common disease that is associated with considerable morbidity if left untreated.
0	59610	Recently, low-molecular-weight heparins (low-molecular-weight heparins) have been evaluated for use in acute treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
0	59610	Randomized studies have shown that low-molecular-weight heparins are as effective as unfractionated heparin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism, and are as safe with respect to the occurrence of major bleeding.
0	59610	A pooled analysis did not show substantial differences among different LMWH compounds used, but no direct comparison of the different low-molecular-weight heparins is currently available.
0	59610	Finally, in patients with pulmonary embolism, there is a relative lack of large studies of daily practice.
0	59610	It could be argued that large prospective studies, in patients who were treated with low-molecular-weight heparins from the moment of diagnosis, are needed.
0	1829425	Objective The primary care visit represents an important venue for intervening with a large population of smokers.
0	1829425	However, physician adherence to the Smoking Cessation Clinical Guideline (5As) remains low.
0	1829425	We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer-tailored intervention designed to increase smoking cessation counseling by primary care physicians.  
0	1829425	Methods Physicians and their patients were randomized to either intervention or control conditions.
0	1829425	In addition to brief smoking cessation training, intervention physicians and patients received a one-page report that characterized the patients’ smoking habit and history and offered tailored recommendations.
0	1829425	Physician performance of the 5As was assessed via patient exit interviews.
0	1829425	Quit rates and smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months postintervention via patient phone interviews.
0	1829425	Intervention effects were tested in a sample of 70 physicians and 518 of their patients.
0	1829425	Results were analyzed via generalized and mixed linear modeling controlling for clustering.  
1	1829425	Measurements and Main Results Intervention physicians exceeded controls on “Assess” (OR 5.06; 95% CI 3.22, 7.95), “Advise” (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.70, 4.59), “Assist–set goals” (OR 4.31; 95% CI 2.59, 7.16), “Assist–provide written materials” (OR 5.14; 95% CI 2.60, 10.14), “
1	1829425	Assist–provide referral” (OR 6.48; 95% CI 3.11, 13.49), “
1	1829425	Assist–discuss medication” (OR 4.72;95% CI 2.90, 7.68), and “Arrange” (OR 8.14; 95% CI 3.98, 16.68), all p values being < 0.0001.
1	1829425	Intervention patients were 1.77 (CI 0.94, 3.34,p = 0.078) times more likely than controls to be abstinent (12 versus 8%), a difference that approached, but did not reach statistical significance, and surpassed controls on number of days quit (18.4 versus 12.2, p < .05) but not on number of quit attempts.  
0	1829425	Conclusions The use of a brief computer-tailored report improved physicians’ implementation of the 5As and had a modest effect on patients’ smoking behaviors 6 months postintervention.
0	4706860	 Objectives.
0	4706860	The effects of Kinesio Taping (Kinesio Taping) on muscular performance remain largely unclear.
0	4706860	This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of Kinesio Taping on the maximum concentric and eccentric quadriceps isokinetic strength.  
0	4706860	Study Design.
0	4706860	This is a single-blinded, placebo crossover, repeated measures study.  
0	4706860	Methods.
0	4706860	Maximum isokinetic concentric/eccentric extension torque, work, and power were assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer without taping (NT) and with Kinesio Taping or placebo taping (placebo taping) in 17 healthy young men.
0	4706860	Repeated measures one-way analysis of variance (analysis of variance) was used for statistical analyses.  
0	4706860	Results.
1	4706860	Testing concentric contractions at 60°/s or 180°/s isokinetic speed, no significant differences in peak torque (Nm), total work (J), or mean power (W) were noted among the application modes under different conditions.
1	4706860	Testing eccentric contractions at 30°/s or 60°/s isokinetic speed, no significant differences in mentioned parameters were noted, respectively.
0	4706860	Kinesio Taping on the quadriceps neither decreased nor increased muscle strength in the participants.  
0	4706860	Conclusion.
0	4706860	Kinesio Taping application onto the skin overlying the quadriceps muscle does not enhance the strength or power of knee extensors in healthy men.
0	5754509	Context Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease), and biomarkers can be used to detect early subclinical cardiovascular disease.
0	5754509	Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin (Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin), midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide) and copeptin are all associated with cardiovascular disease and part of the delicate system controlling fluid and hemodynamic homeostasis through vascular tonus and diuresis.
0	5754509	The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes), improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes including a decrease in particular midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide.  
0	5754509	Objective To investigate if treatment with liraglutide in women with polycystic ovary syndrome reduces levels of the cardiovascular biomarkers Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin, midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide and copeptin.  
0	5754509	Methods Seventy-two overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome were treated with 1.8 mg/day liraglutide or placebo for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled RCT.
0	5754509	Biomarkers, anthropometrics, insulin resistance, body composition (DXA) and visceral fat (MRI) were examined.  
1	5754509	Results Baseline median (IQR) levels were as follows: Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin 0.52 (0.45–0.56) nmol/L, midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 44.8 (34.6–56.7) pmol/L and copeptin 4.95 (3.50–6.50) pmol/L. Mean percentage differences (95% CI) between liraglutide and placebo group after treatment were as follows: Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin −6% (−11 to 2, P = 0.058), midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide −25% (−37 to −11, P = 0.001) and copeptin +4% (−13 to 25, P = 0.64).
0	5754509	Reduction in midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration correlated with both increased heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in the liraglutide group.
0	5754509	Multiple regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, free testosterone, insulin resistance, visceral fat, heart rate and eGFR showed reductions in midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide to be independently correlated with an increase in the heart rate.  
0	5754509	Conclusion In an RCT, liraglutide treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome reduced levels of the cardiovascular risk biomarkers midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide with 25% and Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin with 6% (borderline significance) compared with placebo.
0	5754509	The decrease in midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide was independently associated with an increase in the heart rate.
0	5328251	Background Bristol stool form 1 and 2 is an important predictor of inadequate bowel preparation.  
0	5328251	Aim To evaluate the efficacy of supplemental preparation in bowel cleansing quality among patients with Bristol stool form 1 and 2, as well as the feasibility of tailored bowel preparation guided by Bristol stool form scale.  
0	5328251	Methods Patients with Bristol stool form 1 and 2 from 3 Chinese tertiary hospitals randomly received either 2 L PEG-ELP (group A) or 10 mg bisacodyl plus 2 L PEG-ELP (group B); patients with Bristol stool form 3 to 7 received 2 L PEG-ELP (group C) for bowel preparation.
0	5328251	The primary endpoint is the rate of adequate bowel reparation for the whole colon.
0	5328251	The adequate bowel preparation rate for separate colon segments, the polyp detection rate (polyp detection rate), tolerability, acceptability, sleeping quality and compliance were evaluated as secondary endpoints.  
0	5328251	Results 700 patients were randomized.
1	5328251	In per-protocol analysis, patients in group B attained significantly higher successful preparation rate than group A (88.7% vs. 61.2%, p<0.001) and similar with group C (88.7% vs. 85.0%, p = 0.316).
1	5328251	The polyp detection rate in group B was significantly higher than group A (43.2% vs. 25.7%, p<0.001).
0	5328251	Acceptability was much higher in group B and C.  Conclusions 10 mg bisacodyl plus 2 L PEG-ELP can significantly improve both bowel preparation quality and polyp detection rate in patients with Bristol stool form 1 and 2.
0	5328251	Bristol stool form scale may be an easy and efficient guide for tailored bowel preparation before colonoscopy.
0	3770019	 Objective.
0	3770019	The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Taeeumjowi-tang (TJ001) as well as to estimate obesity-related factors.
0	3770019	Methods.
0	3770019	This was a 12-week trial with 5 visits.
0	3770019	A total of 102 participants of both genders were randomized to either TJ001 (n = 57) group or the placebo group (n = 55).
0	3770019	Subjects were administered 7 g of either TJ001 or placebo 3 times a day.
0	3770019	The primary outcome was a rate of subjects who lost 5% or more of initial weight.
0	3770019	Secondary outcomes included anthropometric parameters, lipid profiles, and body fat composition.
0	3770019	Results.
0	3770019	The subject response rate of ≥5% weight loss compared to baseline was similar in both groups, and no statistically significant difference was observed (P = 0.87).
0	3770019	Changes in anthropometric parameters were greater during the first 4 weeks in the treatment group (P < 0.0001).
0	3770019	There were no significant changes in both within groups and between groups for lipid profile and body fat composition.
0	3770019	No adverse event was reported in either group.
0	3770019	Conclusion.
0	3770019	Although the difference between the groups regarding a rate of subjects who lost 5% or more of initial weight did not show statistical significance, TJ001 appears to be beneficial in safely controlling weight.
0	5844531	Background In 2013, Uganda adopted a test-and-treat policy for HIV patients 15 years or younger.
0	5844531	Low retention rates among paediatric and adolescent antiretroviral therapy (antiretroviral therapy) initiates could severely limit the impact of this new policy.
0	5844531	This evaluation tested the impact of a differentiated care model called Family Clinic Day (Family Clinic Day), a family-centered appointment scheduling and health education intervention on patient retention and adherence to monthly appointment scheduling.  
0	5844531	Methods We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial, from October 2014 to March 2015.
0	5844531	Forty-six facilities were stratified by implementing partner and facility type and randomly assigned to the control or intervention arm.
0	5844531	Primary outcomes included the proportion of patients retained in care at 6 months and the proportion adherent to their appointment schedule at last study period scheduled visit.
0	5844531	Data collection occurred retrospectively in May 2015.
0	5844531	Six patient focus group discussions and 17 health workers interviews were conducted to understand perspectives on Family Clinic Day successes and challenges.  
0	5844531	Results A total of 4,715 paediatric and adolescent patient records were collected, of which 2,679 (n = 1,319 from 23 control facilities and 1,360 from 23 intervention facilities) were eligible for inclusion.
1	5844531	The Family Clinic Day did not improve retention (aOR 1.11; 90% CI 0.63–1.97, p = 0.75), but was associated with improved adherence to last appointment schedule (aOR 1.64; 90% CI 1.27–2.11, p<0.001).
0	5844531	Qualitative findings suggested that Family Clinic Day patients benefited from health education and increased psychosocial support.  
0	5844531	Conclusion Family Clinic Day scale-up in Uganda may be an effective differentiated care model to ensure patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy clinic appointment schedules, a key aspect necessary for viral load suppression.
0	5844531	Patient health outcomes may also benefit following an increase in knowledge based on health education, and peer support.
0	5844531	Broad challenges facing antiretroviral therapy clinics, such as under-staffing and poor filing systems, should be addressed in order to improve patient care.
0	3701849	Background/Aims Carnitine and vitamin complex (Godex®) is widely used in patients with chronic liver disease who show elevated liver enzyme in South Korea.
0	3701849	The purpose of this study is to identify the efficacy and safety of carnitine from entecavir combination therapy in Alanine aminotransferase (Alanine aminotransferase) elevated Chronic Hepatitis B (Chronic Hepatitis B) patients.  
0	3701849	Methods 130 treatment-naïve patients with Chronic Hepatitis B were enrolled from 13 sites.
0	3701849	The patients were randomly selected to the entecavir and the complex of entecavir and carnitine.
0	3701849	The primary endpoint of the study is Alanine aminotransferase normalization level after 12 months.  
0	3701849	Results Among the 130 patients, 119 patients completed the study treatment.
1	3701849	The Alanine aminotransferase normalization at 3 months was 58.9% for the monotherapy and 95.2% for the combination therapy (P<0.0001).
1	3701849	Alanine aminotransferase normalization rate at 12 months was 85.7% for the monotherapy and 100% for the combination group (P=0.0019).
1	3701849	The rate of less than HBV DNA 300 copies/mL at 12 months was not statistically significant (P=0.5318) 75.9% for the monotherapy, 70.7% for the combination and it was.
1	3701849	Quantification of HBsAg level was not different from the monotherapy to combination at 12 months.
1	3701849	Changes of ELISPOT value to evaluate the INF-γ secretion by HBsAg showed the increasing trend of combination therapy compare to mono-treatment.  
0	3701849	Conclusions Alanine aminotransferase normalization rate was higher in carnitine complex combination group than entecavir group in Chronic Hepatitis B. Combination group was faster than entecavir mono-treatment group on Alanine aminotransferase normalization rate.
0	3701849	HBV DNA normalization rate and the serum HBV-DNA level were not changed by carnitine complex treatment.
0	3621765	Background To examine the effect of multicomponent exercise program on memory function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions.  
0	3621765	Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were 100 older adults (mean age, 75 years) with mild cognitive impairment.
0	3621765	The subjects were classified to an amnestic mild cognitive impairment group (n = 50) with neuroimaging measures, and other mild cognitive impairment group (n = 50) before the randomization.
0	3621765	Subjects in each group were randomized to either a multicomponent exercise or an education control group using a ratio of 1∶1.
0	3621765	The exercise group exercised for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, 40 times for 6 months.
0	3621765	The exercise program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory.
0	3621765	The control group attended two education classes.
0	3621765	A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that no group × time interactions on the cognitive tests and brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment patients.
1	3621765	A sub-analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients for group × time interactions revealed that the exercise group exhibited significantly better Mini-Mental State Examination (p = .04) and logical memory scores (p = .04), and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy (p<.05) compared to the control group.
0	3621765	Low total cholesterol levels before the intervention were associated with an improvement of logical memory scores (p<.05), and a higher level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly related to improved ADAS-cog scores (p<.05).  
0	3621765	Conclusions/Significance The results suggested that an exercise intervention is beneficial for improving logical memory and maintaining general cognitive function and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
0	3621765	Low total cholesterol and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
0	3621765	Further studies are required to determine the positive effects of exercise on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

0	5815423	Objective To determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ascending doses of Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray (Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray) zolmitriptan versus placebo for acute migraine treatment.  
0	5815423	Background Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray is a novel patient-administered system for intracutaneous drug administration.
0	5815423	In a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, zolmitriptan administered using Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray had much faster absorption than oral administration with higher exposure in the first two hours.  
0	5815423	Methods This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b/3 study evaluating Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray zolmitriptan 1 mg, 1.9 mg, and 3.8 mg versus placebo.
0	5815423	Co-primary endpoints were pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome other migraine-associated symptom 2 hours post-dose.  
0	5815423	Results Of patients treated with Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray zolmitriptan 3.8 mg or placebo, 41.5% and 14.2%, respectively were pain-free 2 hours post-dose (p = 0.0001) and 68.3% and 42.9% were free from their most bothersome other symptom (p = 0.0009).
0	5815423	Due to the fixed sequential testing methodology, formal statistical significance was not established for secondary endpoints.
0	5815423	However, the proportion of patients who were photophobia-free, phonophobia-free, and nausea-free at 2 hours post-dose was higher in the Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray zolmitriptan 3.8 mg group compared with placebo, as were the percentages of patients who were pain-free, and who experienced pain relief up to 48 hours post-dose.
0	5815423	Systemic adverse events were consistent with previous triptan trials, and included dizziness, paresthesia, muscle tightness, and nausea, all of which occurred in < 5% of patients in any group.

0	4132277	Background Laser lithotripsy is an established endourological modality.
0	4132277	Ho:YAG laser have broadened the indications for ureteroscopic stone managements to include larger stone sizes throughout the whole upper urinary tract.
0	4132277	Aim of current work is to assess efficacy and safety of Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy during retrograde ureteroscopic management of ureteral calculi in different locations.  
0	4132277	Methods 88 patients were treated with ureteroscopic Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy in our institute.
0	4132277	Study endpoint was the number of treatments until the patient was stone-free.
0	4132277	Patients were classified according to the location of their stones as Group I (distal ureteric stones, 51 patients) and group II (proximal ureteral stones, 37).
0	4132277	Group I patients have larger stones as Group II (10.70 mm vs. 8.24 mm, respectively, P = 0.020).  
1	4132277	Results Overall stone free rate for both groups was 95.8%.
0	4132277	The mean number of procedures for proximal calculi was 1.1 ± 0.1 (1–3) and for distal calculi was 1.0 ± 0.0.
1	4132277	The initial treatment was more successful in patients with distal ureteral calculi (100% vs. 82.40%, respectively, P = 0.008).
0	4132277	No significant difference in the stone free rate was noticed after the second laser procedure for stones smaller versus larger than 10 mm (100% versus 94.1%, P = 0.13).
0	4132277	Overall complication rate was 7.9% (Clavien II und IIIb).
0	4132277	Overall and grade-adjusted complication rates were not dependant on the stone location.
0	4132277	No laser induced complications were noticed.  
0	4132277	Conclusions The use of the Ho:YAG laser appears to be an adequate tool to disintegrate ureteral calculi independent of primary location.
0	4132277	Combination of the semirigid and flexible ureteroscopes as well as the appropriate endourologic tools could likely improve the stone clearance rates for proximal calculi regardless of stone-size.
0	546286	This study aimed to evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy), known to prevent osteoporosis and fractures, on markers of bone and cartilage metabolism.
0	546286	Furthermore, we assessed whether changes in these markers corresponded to alterations in bone mineral density and radiographic joint destructions in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis.
0	546286	Eighty-eight women were randomized to receive hormone replacement therapy, calcium, and vitamin D3, or calcium and vitamin D3 alone, for 2 years.
0	546286	Bone turnover was studied by analyzing serum levels of C-terminal telopeptide fragments of type I collagen (CTX-I), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), bone sialoprotein, and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and cartilage turnover by urinary levels of collagen type II C-telopeptide degradation fragments (CTX-II) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) in serum.
0	546286	Treatment with hormone replacement therapy resulted in decrease in CTX-I (P < 0.001), ICTP (P < 0.001), PICP (P < 0.05), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (P < 0.01), and CTX-II (P < 0.05) at 2 years.
0	546286	Reductions in CTX-I, ICTP, and PICP were associated with improved bone mineral density.
0	546286	Of the markers tested, CTX-I reflected bone turnover most sensitively; it was reduced by 53 ± 6% in the patients receiving hormone replacement therapy.
0	546286	Baseline ICTP (P < 0.001), CTX-II (P < 0.01), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (P < 0.05) correlated with the Larsen score.
0	546286	We suggest that biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover may provide a useful tool for assessing novel treatment modalities in arthritis, concerning both joint protection and prevention of osteoporosis.
0	3575556	Background Despite the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea), compliance with therapy remains suboptimal.
0	3575556	The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of S9TM increased compliance in established continuous positive airway pressure users.  
0	3575556	Methods Subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (50) were recruited into the study.
0	3575556	When subjects entered the study, 28 days of respective compliance data were downloaded from the patient's usual continuous positive airway pressure device.
0	3575556	Subjects trialled the S9 continuous positive airway pressure for 28 days.
0	3575556	Subjects then resumed use of their usual continuous positive airway pressure for 28 days.
0	3575556	Compliance data from the patient's usual continuous positive airway pressure pre- and post-trialling S9 were compared with data from the S9 continuous positive airway pressure.  
1	3575556	Results Patients were significantly more compliant when using the S9 than their usual continuous positive airway pressure device both pre- and post-S9 based on average daily usage.
1	3575556	continuous positive airway pressure pre-S9 = 6.58 ± 1.95 (mean hours ± SD), S9 = 7.08 ± 1.18 h and continuous positive airway pressure post-S9 = 6.71 ± 1.72 h.
1	3575556	The difference between continuous positive airway pressure pre-S9 and S9 was 0.5 h (p = 0.003).
1	3575556	The difference between S9 and continuous positive airway pressure post-S9 was 0.35 h (p = 0.01).
1	3575556	There was no significant difference between continuous positive airway pressure pre-S9 and continuous positive airway pressure post-S9 (p = 0.34).
0	3575556	Patients also completed questionnaires comparing the S9 system to their usual device.
0	3575556	Subjective feedback showed a strong preference for the S9.  
0	3575556	Conclusions Participants were significantly more compliant when using the S9 than their usual continuous positive airway pressure device both pre- and post-S9 use.
0	3510746	Background University students in Sweden routinely receive proactive mail-based alcohol Internet interventions sent from student health services.
0	3510746	This intervention provides personalized normative feedback on alcohol consumption with suggestions on how to decrease drinking.
0	3510746	Earlier feasibility trials by our group and others have examined effectiveness in simple parallel-groups designs.  
0	3510746	Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of electronic screening and brief intervention, using a randomized controlled trial design that takes account of baseline assessment reactivity (and other possible effects of the research process) due to the similarity between the intervention and assessment content.
0	3510746	The design of the study allowed for exploration of the magnitude of the assessment effects per se.  
0	3510746	Methods This trial used a dismantling design and randomly assigned 5227 students to 3 groups: (1) routine practice assessment and feedback, (2) assessment-only without feedback, and (3) neither assessment nor feedback.
0	3510746	At baseline all participants were blinded to study participation, with no contact being made with group 3.
0	3510746	We approached students 2 months later to participate in a cross-sectional alcohol survey.
0	3510746	All interventions were fully automated and did not have any human involvement.
0	3510746	All data used in the analysis were based on self-assessment using questionnaires.
0	3510746	The participants were unaware that they were participating in a trial and thus were also blinded to which group they were randomly assigned.  
0	3510746	Results Overall, 44.69% (n = 2336) of those targeted for study completed follow-up.
1	3510746	Attrition was similar in groups 1 (697/1742, 40.01%) and 2 (737/1742, 42.31% retained) and lower in group 3 (902/1743, 51.75% retained).
0	3510746	Intention-to-treat analyses among all participants regardless of their baseline drinking status revealed no differences between groups in all alcohol parameters at the 2-month follow-up.
0	3510746	Per-protocol analyses of groups 1 and 2 among those who accepted the email intervention (36.2% of the students who were offered the intervention in group 1 and 37.3% of the students in group2 ) and who were risky drinkers at baseline (60.7% follow-up rate in group 1 and 63.5% in group 2) suggested possible small beneficial effects on weekly consumption attributable to feedback.  
0	3510746	Conclusions This approach to outcome evaluation is highly conservative, and small benefits may follow the actual uptake of feedback intervention in students who are risky drinkers, the precise target group.

0	3616846	Background Nutritionists advise pregnant women to eat fish to obtain adequate docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid), an essential nutrient important for optimal brain development.
0	3616846	However, concern exists that this advice will lead to excess intake of methylmercury, a developmental neurotoxicant.  
0	3616846	Objective Conduct a pilot intervention to increase consumption of high-DHA, low-mercury fish in pregnancy.  
0	3616846	Methods In April-October 2010 we recruited 61 women in the greater Boston, MA area at 12–22 weeks gestation who consumed <=2 fish servings/month, and obtained outcome data from 55.
0	3616846	We randomized participants to 3 arms: Advice to consume low-mercury/high-DHA fish (n=18); Advice + grocery store gift cards (gift cards) to purchase fish (n=17); or Control messages (n=20).
0	3616846	At baseline and 12-week follow-up we estimated intake of fish, docosahexaenoic acid and mercury using a 1-month fish intake food frequency questionnaire, and measured plasma docosahexaenoic acid and blood and hair total mercury.  
0	3616846	Results Baseline characteristics and mean (range) intakes of fish [21 (0–125) g/day] and docosahexaenoic acid from fish [91 (0–554) mg/d] were similar in all 3 arms.
1	3616846	From baseline to follow-up, intake of fish [Advice: 12 g/day (95% CI: -5, 29), Advice+GC: 22 g/day (5, 39)] and docosahexaenoic acid [Advice: 70 mg/d (3, 137), Advice+GC: 161 mg/d (93, 229)] increased in both intervention groups, compared with controls.
1	3616846	At follow-up, no control women consumed >= 200mg/d of docosahexaenoic acid from fish, compared with 33% in the Advice arm (p=0.005) and 53% in the Advice+GC arm (p=0.0002).
1	3616846	We did not detect any differences in mercury intake or in biomarker levels of mercury and docosahexaenoic acid between groups.  
0	3616846	Conclusions An educational intervention increased consumption of fish and docosahexaenoic acid but not mercury.
0	3616846	Future studies are needed to determine intervention effects on pregnancy and childhood health outcomes.

0	1543618	Background We translated, modified, and extended a cognitive behavioral treatment (cognitive behavioral treatment) protocol by Blanchard and Hickling (2003) for the purpose of treating survivors of MVA with full or subsyndromal posttraumatic stress disorder (posttraumatic stress disorder) whose native language is German.
0	1543618	The treatment manual included some additional elements, e. g. cognitive procedures, imaginal reliving, and facilitating of posttraumatic growth.
0	1543618	The current study was conducted in order to test the efficacy of the modified manual by administering randomized controlled trial in which a cognitive behavioral treatment was compared to a wait-list control condition.  
0	1543618	Methods Forty-two motor vehicle accident survivors with chronic or severe subsyndromal posttraumatic stress disorder (posttraumatic stress disorder) completed the treatment trial with two or three detailed assessments (pre, post, and 3-month follow-up).  
1	1543618	Results CAPS-scores showed significantly greater improvement in the cognitive behavioral treatment condition as compared to the wait list condition (group × time interaction effect size d = 1.61).
0	1543618	Intent-to-treat analysis supported the outcome (d = 1.34).
0	1543618	Categorical diagnostic data indicated clinical recovery of 67% (post-treatment) and 76% (3 months FU) in the treatment group.
1	1543618	Additionally, patients of the cognitive behavioral treatment condition showed significantly greater reductions in co-morbid major depression than the control condition.
0	1543618	At follow-up the improvements were stable in the active treatment condition.  
0	1543618	Conclusion The degree of improvement in our treatment group was comparable to that in previously reported treatment trials of posttraumatic stress disorder with cognitive behavioral therapy.

0	3532098	Background Platelet Rich Plasma (Platelet Rich Plasma), a blood-derived product rich in growth factors, is a promising treatment for cartilage defects but there is still a lack of clinical evidence.
0	3532098	The aim of this study is to show, through a randomized double blind prospective trial, the efficacy of this procedure, by comparing Platelet Rich Plasma to Hyaluronic Acid (Hyaluronic Acid) injections for the treatment of knee chondropathy or osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis).  
0	3532098	Methods 109 patients (55 treated with Hyaluronic Acid and 54 with Platelet Rich Plasma) were treated and evaluated at 12 months of follow-up.
0	3532098	The patients were enrolled according to the following inclusion criteria: age> 18 years, history of chronic (at least 4 months) pain or swelling of the knee and imaging findings of degenerative changes of the joint (Kellgren-Lawrence Score up to 3).
0	3532098	A cycle of 3 weekly injections was administered blindly.
0	3532098	All patients were prospectively evaluated before and at 2, 6, and 12 months after the treatment by: IKDC, EQ-VAS, TEGNER, and KOOS scores.
0	3532098	Range of motion and knee circumference changes were measured over time.
0	3532098	Adverse events and patient satisfaction were also recorded.  
1	3532098	Results Only minor adverse events were detected in some patients, such as mild pain and effusion after the injections, in particular in the Platelet Rich Plasma group, where a significantly higher post-injective pain reaction was observed (p=0.039).
0	3532098	At the follow-up evaluations, both groups presented a clinical improvement but the comparison between the two groups showed a not statistically significant difference in all scores evaluated.
0	3532098	A trend favorable for the Platelet Rich Plasma group was only found in patients with low grade articular degeneration (Kellgren-Lawrence score up to 2).  
0	3532098	Conclusions Results suggest that Platelet Rich Plasma injections offer a significant clinical improvement up to one year of follow-up.
0	3532098	However, conversely to what was shown by the current literature, for middle-aged patients with moderate signs of osteoarthritis, Platelet Rich Plasma results were not better than those obtained with Hyaluronic Acid injections, and thus it should not be considered as first line treatment.
0	3532098	More promising results are shown for its use in low grade degeneration, but they still have to be confirmed.
0	4591119	Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the program Keep Moving toward Healthy Heart and Healthy Brain (KM2H2) in encouraging physical activities for the prevention of heart attack and stroke among hypertensive patients enrolled in the Community-Based Hypertension Control Program (Community-Based Hypertension Control Program).  
0	4591119	Design Cluster randomized controlled trial with three waves of longitudinal assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months post intervention.  
0	4591119	Setting Community-based and patient-centered self-care for behavioral intervention in urban settings of China.  
0	4591119	Participants A total of 450 participants diagnosed with hypertension from 12 community health centers in Wuhan, China were recruited, and were randomly assigned by center to receive either KM2H2 plus standard Community-Based Hypertension Control Program care (6 centers and 232 patients) or the standard care only (6 centers and 218 patients).  
0	4591119	Intervention KM2H2 is a behavioral intervention guided by the Transtheoretical Model, the Model of Personalized Medicine and Social Capital Theory.
0	4591119	It consists of six intervention sessions and two booster sessions engineered in a progressive manner.
0	4591119	The purpose is to motivate and maintain physical activities for the prevention of heart attack and stroke.  
0	4591119	Outcome Measures Heart attack and stroke (clinically diagnosed, primary outcome), blood pressure (measured, secondary outcome), and physical activity (self-report, tertiary outcome) were assessed at the individual level during the baseline, 3- and 6-month post-intervention.  
0	4591119	Results Relative to the standard care, receiving KM2H2 was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of heart attack (3.60% vs. 7.03%, p < .05) and stroke (5.11% vs. 9.90%, p<0.05), and moderate reduction in blood pressure (-3.72mmHg in DBP and -2.92 mmHg in DBP) at 6-month post-intervention; and significant increases in physical activity at 3- (d = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.85) and 6-month (d = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.85) post-intervention, respectively.  
0	4591119	Conclusion The program KM2H2 is efficacious to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke among senior patients who are on anti-hypertensive medication.

0	3621886	Background Untreated HIV may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
0	3621886	Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo research suggests that pentoxifylline (pentoxifylline) reduces vascular inflammation and improves endothelial function in HIV-infected persons not requiring antiretroviral therapy.  
0	3621886	Methods We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pentoxifylline 400 mg orally thrice daily for 8 weeks in 26 participants.
0	3621886	The primary endpoint was change in flow-mediated dilation (flow-mediated dilation) of the brachial artery after 8 weeks.
0	3621886	Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation) and circulating markers of inflammation, cellular immune activation, coagulation, and metabolism were also assessed.  
0	3621886	Results The difference in mean absolute change (SD) in flow-mediated dilation after 8 weeks between the placebo [−1.06 (1.45)%] and pentoxifylline [−1.93 (3.03)%] groups was not significant (P = 0.44).
0	3621886	No differences in Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation were observed.
0	3621886	The only significant between-group difference in the changes in biomarkers from baseline to week 8 was in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFRI) [−83.2 pg/mL in the placebo group vs. +65.9 pg/mL in the pentoxifylline group; P = 0.03].
0	3621886	pentoxifylline was generally well-tolerated.  
0	3621886	Conclusions pentoxifylline did not improve endothelial function and unexpectedly increased the inflammatory biomarker sTNFRI in HIV-infected participants not requiring antiretroviral therapy.
0	3621886	Additional interventional research is needed to reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk in this population.

0	5398527	Background: Low dietary quality and quantity and inappropriate feeding practices can cause undernutrition.
0	5398527	Poor nutritional status in early childhood is associated with growth faltering.
0	5398527	The objective of the study was to assess the potential of community-based nutrition education to improve height-for-age z-scores in children 6–23 months of age.
0	5398527	Methods and Findings: We carried out a cluster-randomized-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of nutrition education.
0	5398527	A total of 24 Extension Planning Area Sections served as clusters.
0	5398527	The selection criteria were: the position of the extension officer was staffed and the sections had been selected by the project for activities in its first project year.
0	5398527	The sections were randomized into intervention and control restricted on mean height for age Z-score using baseline information.
0	5398527	In the intervention area, food security activities and community-based nutrition education was implemented.
0	5398527	The control area received food security activities only.
0	5398527	At baseline (2011) and endline (2014), caregivers with a child below two years of age were enrolled.
0	5398527	Data assessment included anthropometric measurements, interviews on socio-economic status, dietary intake and feeding practices.
0	5398527	A difference-in-differences estimator was used to calculate intervention effects.
0	5398527	A positive impact on child dietary diversity was observed (B (SE) = 0.39 (0.15), p = 0.01; 95%CI 0.09–0.68).
1	5398527	There was a non-significant positive intervention effect on mean height-for-age z-scores (B (SE) = 0.17 (0.12), p = 0.15; 95%CI -0.06–0.41).
0	5398527	Limitations: The 24h dietary recalls used to measure dietary diversity did not consider quantities of consumed foods.
0	5398527	Unrecorded poor quality of consumed foods might have masked a potential benefit of increased child dietary diversity on growth.
0	5398527	Conclusions: Participatory community-based nutrition education for caregivers improved child dietary diversity even in a food insecure area.
0	5398527	Nutrition education should be part of programs in food insecure settings aiming at ameliorating food insecurity among communities.
0	3757794	Background: The Truview EVO2 blade facilitates the view of vocal cords by indirect laryngoscopy and does not require the proper alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes as with the Macintosh blade.  
0	3757794	Methods: In a crossover fashion, we prospectively compared the view obtained at laryngoscopy with Truview EVO2 and the Macintosh blade in 110 adult patients of either sex between the age of 18 and 60 years, who were scheduled to undergo general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
0	3757794	The patients were intubated with the second laryngoscope.
0	3757794	The preoperative airway variables, laryngoscopic view, difficulty of intubation scale (IDS) score, duration of intubation, and degree of difficulty percentage of glottic opening (POGO score) of use with each laryngoscope were compared.  
1	3757794	Results: The IDS score was low and comparable between the two laryngoscopes.
0	3757794	The laryngeal view was easy; Modified Cormack Lehane (Modified Cormack Lehane) grade 2a or less in 98.14% of the cases with the Truview laryngoscope compared to 78.7% of the cases with the Macintosh laryngoscope.
0	3757794	Nineteen patients of Modified Cormack Lehane grade 3, one patient of grade 2b, and seven patients of grade 2a view with the Macintosh laryngoscope had Modified Cormack Lehane grade 1 view with the Truview laryngoscope.
1	3757794	The duration of intubation was comparable between Truview and Macintosh laryngoscopes (12.1±3.8 s vs. 10.9±2.1 s).  
0	3757794	Conclusion: Truview laryngoscope performed comparably to Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with normal airway; however, the Truview laryngoscope may be a better option in difficult airway situations when the Macintosh blade fails to show the glottic opening.
0	5557997	Objectives: The main disadvantage of fiber posts is their low bond strength to root canal wall.
0	5557997	The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of different root canal post space treatments on push-out bond strength of fiber posts to root canal dentin.  
0	5557997	Materials and Methods: After post space preparation in 40 endodontically treated human premolars, the teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups: Group 1: control group, group 2: Endsolv R, group 3: ultrasonic cleaning, group 4: Clearfil Repair.
0	5557997	Afterwards, the posts were bonded with Panavia F 2.0 bonding cement.
0	5557997	The bond strength of fiber posts to root canal wall in the middle part of canal was evaluated following thermocycling using push-out test.
0	5557997	Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tamhane’s multiple comparisons test.
0	5557997	The failure mode of each group was determined under a stereomicroscope.  
0	5557997	Results: There was a significant difference in the mean push-out bond strength among the groups (P<0.05).
1	5557997	The lowest bond strength was noted in the control group.
1	5557997	The control group had significant differences with ultrasonic and Clearfil Repair groups (P<0.05).
0	5557997	The bond strength of Endsolv R group increased; however, it was not significant (P>0.05).  
0	5557997	Conclusions: It seems that ultrasonic cleaning and Clearfil Repair can modify the root canal wall and significantly increase the bond strength of fiber posts.
0	3823877	Background Emergency department discharge instructions are variably understood by patients, and in the setting of emergency department crowding, innovations are needed to counteract shortened interaction times with the physician.
0	3823877	We evaluated the effect of viewing an online video of diagnosis-specific discharge instructions on patient comprehension and recall of instructions.  
0	3823877	Methods In this prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial conducted between November 2011 and January 2012, we randomized emergency department patients who were discharged with one of 38 diagnoses to either view (after they left the emergency department) a vetted online video of diagnosis-specific discharge instructions, or to usual care.
0	3823877	Patients were subsequently contacted by telephone and asked three standardized questions about their discharge instructions; one point was awarded for each correct answer.
0	3823877	Using an intention-to-treat analysis, differences between groups were assessed using univariate testing, and with logistic regression that accounted for clustering on managing physician.
0	3823877	A secondary outcome measure was patient satisfaction with the videos, on a 10-point scale.  
0	3823877	Results Among 133 patients enrolled, mean age was 46.1 (s.d.
0	3823877	D. 21.5) and 55% were female.
0	3823877	Patients in the video group had 19% higher mean scores (2.5, s.d.
0	3823877	0.7) than patients in the control group (2.1, s.d.
0	3823877	0.8) (p=0.002).
0	3823877	After adjustment for patient age, sex, first language, triage acuity score, and clustering, the odds of achieving a fully correct score (3 out of 3) were 3.5 (95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2) times higher in the video group, compared to the control group.
0	3823877	Among those who viewed the videos, median rating of the videos was 10 (IQR 8 to 10).  
0	3823877	Conclusions In this single-center trial, patients who viewed an online video of their discharge instructions scored higher on their understanding of key concepts around their diagnosis and subsequent care.

0	4557407	Background: A cardiac catheterization laboratory can be a frightening environment and music can be a supportive source of environmental sound that stimulates and maintains relaxation.
0	4557407	However, the results of studies are conflicting in this regard.  
0	4557407	Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of music therapy on patients’ anxiety and hemodynamic parameters during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  
0	4557407	Patients and Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial, conducted in the Catheterization Laboratory Unit of Baqiyatallah Hospital, in Tehran, Iran.
0	4557407	A sample of 64 patients, who were planned to undergo coronary angioplasty, was recruited.
0	4557407	Patients were randomly allocated to either the control or the experimental groups.
0	4557407	In the experimental group, patients received a 20 to 40-minute music therapy intervention, consisting of light instrumental music albums by Johann Sebastian Bach and Mariko Makino.
0	4557407	Patients in the control group received the routine care of the study setting, which consisted of no music therapy intervention.
0	4557407	Study data were collected by a demographic questionnaire, the Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory, and a data sheet for documenting hemodynamic parameters.
0	4557407	Chi-square, independent-samples t tests, paired-samples t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.  
0	4557407	Results: Before the intervention, the study groups did not differ significantly in terms of anxiety level and hemodynamic parameters.
0	4557407	Moreover, the differences between the two groups, regarding hemodynamic parameters, were not significant after the intervention (P > 0.05).
0	4557407	However, the level of post-intervention anxiety in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group (32.06 ± 8.57 and 38.97 ± 12.77, respectively; P = 0.014).
0	4557407	Compared with the baseline readings, the level of anxiety in the control group did not change significantly after the study (41.91 ± 9.88 vs. 38.97 ± 12.77; P = 0.101); however, in the experimental group, the level of post-intervention anxiety was significantly lower than the pretest readings (32.06 ± 8.57 vs. 41.16 ± 10.6; P = 0.001).  
0	4557407	Conclusions: Music therapy is a safe, simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive nursing intervention, which can significantly alleviate patients’ anxiety during coronary angioplasty.
0	5557574	Background Vasopressin is widely used for vasopressor support in septic shock patients, but experimental evidence suggests that selective V1A agonists are superior.
0	5557574	The initial pharmacodynamic effects, pharmacokinetics, and safety of selepressin, a novel V1A-selective vasopressin analogue, was examined in a phase IIa trial in septic shock patients.  
0	5557574	Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 53 patients in early septic shock (aged ≥18 years, fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressor support) who received selepressin 1.25 ng/kg/minute (n = 10), 2.5 ng/kg/minute (n = 19), 3.75 ng/kg/minute (n = 2), or placebo (n = 21) until shock resolution or a maximum of 7 days.
0	5557574	If mean arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure) ≥65 mmHg was not maintained, open-label norepinephrine was added.
0	5557574	Co-primary endpoints were maintenance of mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg without norepinephrine, norepinephrine dose, and proportion of patients maintaining mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg with or without norepinephrine over 7 days.
0	5557574	Secondary endpoints included cumulative fluid balance, organ dysfunction, pharmacokinetics, and safety.  
1	5557574	Results A higher proportion of the patients receiving 2.5 ng/kg/minute selepressin maintained mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg without norepinephrine (about 50% and 70% at 12 and 24 h, respectively) vs. 1.25 ng/kg/minute selepressin and placebo (p < 0.01).
1	5557574	The 7-day cumulative doses of norepinephrine were 761, 659, and 249 μg/kg (placebo 1.25 ng/kg/minute and 2.5 ng/kg/minute, respectively; 2.5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo; p < 0.01).
1	5557574	Norepinephrine infusion was weaned more rapidly in selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute vs. placebo (0.04 vs. 0.18 μg/kg/minute at 24 h, p < 0.001), successfully maintaining target mean arterial pressure and reducing norepinephrine dose vs. placebo (first 24 h, p < 0.001).
1	5557574	Cumulative net fluid balance was lower from day 5 onward in the selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group vs. placebo (p < 0.05).
1	5557574	The selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute group had a greater proportion of days alive and free of ventilation vs. placebo (p < 0.02).
1	5557574	Selepressin (2.5 ng/kg/minute) was well tolerated, with a similar frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events for selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute and placebo.
0	5557574	Two patients were infused at 3.75 ng/kg/minute, one of whom had the study drug infusion discontinued for possible safety reasons, with subsequent discontinuation of this dose group.  
0	5557574	Conclusions In septic shock patients, selepressin 2.5 ng/kg/minute was able to rapidly replace norepinephrine while maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure, and it may improve fluid balance and shorten the time of mechanical ventilation.

0	3757792	Background: The pleth variability index (pleth variability index), which is calculated from respiratory variations in the perfusion index (perfusion index), has been shown to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients; however, vasomotor tone changes induced by hypercapnia can affect perfusion index and hence may slim down the accuracy of pleth variability index.
0	3757792	This study was designed to find out the impact of mild hypercapnia on pleth variability index.  
0	3757792	Methods: A total of 30 patients were randomized after induction of general anesthesia with target controlled infusion propofol and remifentanil to either hypercapnia, (etCO2 =45 mmHg), (group 1, 15 patients) or normocapnia (etCO2 =35 mmHg) (group 2, 15 patients).
0	3757792	After a stabilization period of 10 min, patients were crossed over to the other intentional level of etCO2.
0	3757792	Heart rate (Heart rate), mean arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure), perfusion index, pleth variability index were collected at the end of each stabilization period.  
0	3757792	Results: Patient characteristics and baseline values of Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, perfusion index and pleth variability index were comparable between the groups.
0	3757792	Carryover effect was statistically excluded.
0	3757792	Hypercapnia significantly increased perfusion index and decreased pleth variability index with significant negative correlation.  
0	3757792	Conclusion: Hypercapnia retracts back pleth variability index values compared with normocapnia.
0	3757792	Precise judgment of fluid responsiveness as indicated by pleth variability index necessitates its comparison against similar etCO2 levels.
0	79000	Background Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors increase new bone formation in vitro and in rodents.
0	79000	Results of epidemiologic analyses evaluating the association between use of these cholesterol-lowering drugs, bone mineral density and fracture have been mixed.  
0	79000	Methods Women (n = 24) with osteopenia, assessed by broad band ultrasound attenuation, were randomized to simvastatin 20 mg, 40 mg or identical-appearing placebo for 12 weeks.
0	79000	Fasting lipid profiles and biochemical markers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and resorption (N-telopeptides and C-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen) were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.  
1	79000	Results Plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration fell 7%, 39% (p < 0.01 vs baseline) and 47% (p < 0.01 vs baseline) after 12 weeks of treatment with placebo, simvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively.
0	79000	At baseline, bone marker concentrations were similar in the three treatment groups.
1	79000	At 6 and 12 weeks, bone marker concentrations were not different from baseline, and no significant differences in bone marker concentrations were observed between treatment groups at either 6 or 12 weeks.  
0	79000	Conclusion Among osteopenic women, treatment with simvastatin for 12 weeks did not affect markers of bone formation or resorption.
0	3682318	Introduction Catheter-related bloodstream infections (Catheter-related bloodstream infections) associated with short-term central venous catheters (central venous catheters) in intensive care unit (intensive care unit) patients are a major clinical problem.
0	3682318	Bacterial colonization of the skin at the CVC insertion site is an important etiologic factor for CRBSI.
0	3682318	The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of medical-grade honey in reducing bacterial skin colonization at insertion sites.  
0	3682318	Methods A prospective, single-center, open-label randomized controlled trial was performed at the intensive care unit of a university hospital in The Netherlands to assess the efficacy of medical-grade honey to reduce skin colonization of insertion sites.
0	3682318	Medical-grade honey was applied in addition to standard CVC-site dressing and disinfection with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol.
0	3682318	Skin colonization was assessed on a daily basis before CVC-site disinfection.
0	3682318	The primary end point was colonization of insertion sites with >100 colony-forming units at the last sampling before removal of the CVC or transfer of the patient from the intensive care unit.
0	3682318	Secondary end points were quantitative levels of colonization of the insertion sites and colonization of insertion sites stratified for CVC location.  
1	3682318	Results Colonization of insertion sites was not affected by the use of medical-grade honey, as 44 (34%) of 129 and 36 (34%) of 106 patients in the honey and standard care groups, respectively, had a positive skin culture (P = 0.98).
1	3682318	Median levels of skin colonization at the last sampling were 1 (0 to 2.84) and 1 (0 to 2.70) log colony-forming units (CFUs)/swab for the honey and control groups, respectively (P = 0.94).
0	3682318	Gender, days of CVC placement, CVC location, and CVC type were predictive for a positive skin culture.
0	3682318	Correction for these variables did not change the effect of honey on skin-culture positivity.  
0	3682318	Conclusions Medical-grade honey does not affect colonization of the skin at CVC insertion sites in intensive care unit patients when applied in addition to standard disinfection with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol.

0	3685780	Aim: Type II diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
0	3685780	Treatment with insulin substantially reduces C - reactive protein (C - reactive protein) because of its anti-atherosclerotic action.
0	3685780	This study was designed to explore and compare the cardio protective role of regular human insulin (regular human insulin), aspart and lispro insulin in type II diabetes mellitus.  
0	3685780	Materials and Methods: A randomized, open, parallel group, comparative clinical study was conducted on 90 patients of type II diabetes mellitus.
0	3685780	After baseline clinical assessment and investigations, regular human insulin was prescribed to 30 patients, aspart insulin to 30 patients and lispro insulin to another 30 patients for 12 weeks.
0	3685780	The efficacy variables were change in blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid profile, serum potassium, high-sensitivity C - reactive protein (high-sensitivity CRP) and UKPDS 10-year CHD risk scoring over 12 weeks.
0	3685780	At the end of the study, the patients were followed up and changes in variables from baseline were analyzed by statistical tools.  
0	3685780	Results: Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in aspart group (P = 0.008) whereas diastolic blood pressure was decreased significantly both in aspart (P < 0.001) and lispro group (P = 0.01).
1	3685780	Fasting, postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c were decreased in all three groups significantly but change in aspart group was superior (P = 0.01).
1	3685780	Triglyceride was significantly better controlled by lispro (P < 0.01) whereas aspart insulin was superior to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (P < 0.05).
1	3685780	The extent of potassium loss was significantly more with regular human insulin (P = 0.004) than others.
1	3685780	CRP-lowering effect (P = 0.017) and decrease in UKPDS risk scoring (P = 0.019) in aspart and lispro group was superior to regular human insulin group.  
0	3685780	Conclusion: Short acting insulin analogues, especially aspart insulin have been found to have a better cardio protective role than regular human insulin in type II diabetes mellitus.
0	4584965	Aims Macro-nutrient preloads given 30 min before regular meals may improve metabolism.
0	4584965	The aim was to investigate how type 2 diabetic patients react to a preload consisting of a blend of macro-nutrients with a low-glycemic index (Inzone Preload®).  
0	4584965	Methods In a before–after study design, 30 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus) were enrolled in a 12-week program.
0	4584965	All subjects were given Inzone Preload (43% proteins, 29% carbohydrates, 10% lipids, and 9% fibers, 71 kcal), 30 min before each meal during 12 weeks.
0	4584965	Fasting glucose and postprandial 2 h glucose were monitored every second week.
0	4584965	Body weight (Body weight) and waist circumference were measured each month.
0	4584965	Fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum lipids, fasting insulin, C-reactive protein, and homeostasis model assessment were evaluated before and after the intervention.
0	4584965	Subjective appetite was monitored using visual analogue scales after the Inzone Preload.  
0	4584965	Results The dietary intervention significantly influenced several metabolic parameters compared to base line.
0	4584965	Inzone Preload treatment reduced mean postprandial plasma glucose levels (12.2 ± 1.2 vs. 10.5 ± 2.0 mmol/L), HbA1c (7.4 ± 0.3 vs. 7.1 ± 0.2%), mean total cholesterol (4.8 ± 0.9 vs. 4.3 ± 0.8 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.8 ± 0.6 vs. 2.5 ± 0.4 mmol/L), and CRP (1.5 ± 1.4 vs. 0.7 ± 0.7 mg/L).
0	4584965	Body weight loss of more than 3% was seen in 13 participants (43%).
0	4584965	Feelings of satiety were significantly higher after Inzone Preload than after habitual breakfast (p < 0.05).
0	4584965	No significant changes in fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein and total triacylglycerol, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β were observed.  
0	4584965	Conclusion A macro-nutrient preload treatment reduces postprandial glucose, inflammatory markers, and serum lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	4584965	Approximately half of the study group also displayed reduced Body weight.
0	5892002	Background Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease associated with poorer health outcomes and decreased health related quality of life (health related quality of life).
0	5892002	The aim of this analysis was to explore the impact of a disease management programme (disease management programme) in type 2 diabetes on HRQoL. A multilevel model was used to explain the variation in EQ-VAS.  
0	5892002	Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial—analysis of the secondary endpoint HRQoL. Our study population were general practitioners and patients in the province of Salzburg.
0	5892002	The disease management programme “Therapie-Aktiv” was implemented in the intervention group, and controls received usual care.
0	5892002	Outcome measure was a change in EQ-VAS after 12 months.
0	5892002	For comparison of rates, we used Fisher’s Exact test; for continuous variables the independent T test or Welch test were used.
0	5892002	In the multilevel modeling, we examined various models, continuously adding variables to explain the variation in the dependent variable, starting with an empty model, including only the random intercept.
0	5892002	We analysed random effects parameters in order to disentangle variation of the final EQ-VAS.  
0	5892002	Results The EQ-VAS significantly increased within the intervention group (mean difference 2.19, p = 0.005).
1	5892002	There was no significant difference in EQ-VAS between groups (mean difference 1.00, p = 0.339).
0	5892002	In the intervention group the improvement was more distinct in women (2.46, p = 0.036) compared to men (1.92, p = 0.063).
0	5892002	In multilevel modeling, sex, age, family and work circumstances, any macrovascular diabetic complication, duration of diabetes, baseline body mass index and baseline EQ-VAS significantly influence final EQ-VAS, while disease management programme does not.
0	5892002	The final model explains 28.9% (EQ-VAS) of the total variance.
0	5892002	Most of the unexplained variance was found on patient-level (95%) and less on GP-level (5%).  
0	5892002	Conclusion disease management programme “
0	5892002	Therapie-Aktiv” has no significant impact on final EQ-VAS.
0	5892002	The impact of disease management programmes in type 2 diabetes on health related quality of life is still unclear and future programmes should focus on patient specific needs and predictors in order to improve HRQoL.

0	5850666	Background: Postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome (metabolic syndrome) have increased cardiovascular morbidity and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (left ventricular diastolic dysfunction).
0	5850666	The various protective effects of astragalus membranaceus (astragalus membranaceus) have been described in previous studies.
0	5850666	Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different doses of astragalus membranaceus on diastolic function in postmenopausal hypertensive women with MetS.  Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled study.
0	5850666	The postmenopausal hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome were enrolled from Lanzhou University Second Hospital from March 2014 to April 2015.
0	5850666	Patients were divided into three groups: control group (received conventional medical treatment), astragalus membranaceus Group 1 (received astragalus membranaceus capsules at 5 g/d additionally), and astragalus membranaceus Group 2 (received astragalus membranaceus capsules at 10 g/d additionally).
0	5850666	Echocardiographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated before and 12 months after treatment.
0	5850666	Quantitative data were analyzed using unpaired t-test, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis.  
0	5850666	Results: A total of 154 patients were subjected to final analysis.
1	5850666	In the astragalus membranaceus Group 2, significant improvements were noted in diastolic function 12 months after treatment than those of the control group, including the early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E’; 0.065 ± 0.007 m/s vs. 0.061 ± 0.008 m/s, P = 0.014), the ratio of the early diastolic mitral peak flow velocity to the late diastolic mitral peak flow velocity (E/A; 0.81 ± 0.05 vs. 0.80 ± 0.06, P = 0.012), the ratio of E’ to the late diastolic mitral annular velocity (E’/A’; 0.56 ± 0.12 vs. 0.51 ± 0.13, P = 0.048), and the ratio of the early diastolic mitral peak flow velocity (E) to E’ (E/E’; 10.70 ± 1.30 vs. 11.37 ± 1.73, P = 0.031).
0	5850666	After treatment, E/E’ (10.70 ± 1.30 vs. 11.24 ± 1.56, P = 0.021), deceleration time (DT; 261.49 ± 44.41 ms vs. 268.74 ± 53.87 ms, P = 0.046), and E’/A’ (0.56 ± 0.12 vs. 0.52 ± 0.13, P = 0.019) values improved more significantly than those of astragalus membranaceus Group 2 before treatment.
0	5850666	Besides, waist circumference was positively correlated with E’ (r = 0.472; P = 0.003) and E’/A’ (r = 0.321; P = 0.047).
0	5850666	In addition, the waist-to-hip ratio was a significant predictor of DT (r = 0.276; P = 0.041), E’ (r = −0.590; P < 0.001), E/E’ (r = 0.454; P = 0.004), and E’/A’ (r = −0.377; P = 0.018).  
0	5850666	Conclusions: Conventional medical plus astragalus membranaceus therapy improved diastolic function.
0	5850666	Moreover, WC and WHR might be risk factors for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

0	3728070	Background Prospective efficacy monitoring of anti-malarial treatments is imperative for timely detection of resistance development.
0	3728070	The in vivo efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine (artesunate-amodiaquine) fixed-dose combination (fixed-dose combination) was compared to that of artemether-lumefantrine (artemether-lumefantrine) among children aged six to 59 months in Nimba County, Liberia, where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic and efficacy data are scarce.  
0	3728070	Methods An open-label, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial compared the genotyping adjusted day 42 cure rates of artesunate-amodiaquine fixed-dose combination (artesunate-amodiaquine Winthrop®) to artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem®) in 300 children aged six to 59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
0	3728070	Inclusion was between December 2008 and May 2009.
0	3728070	Randomization (1:1) was to a three-day observed oral regimen (artesunate-amodiaquine: once a day; artemether-lumefantrine: twice a day, given with fatty food).
0	3728070	Day 7 desethylamodiaquine and lumefantrine blood-concentrations were also measured.  
1	3728070	Results The day 42 genotyping-adjusted cure rate estimates were 97.3% [95% CI: 91.6-99.1] for artesunate-amodiaquine and 94.2% [88.1-97.2] for artemether-lumefantrine (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates).
1	3728070	The difference in day 42 cure rates was −3.1% [upper limit 95% CI: 1.2%].
0	3728070	These results were confirmed by observed proportion of patients cured at day 42 on the per-protocol population.
1	3728070	Parasite clearance was 100% (artesunate-amodiaquine) and 99.3% (artemether-lumefantrine) on day 3.
1	3728070	The probability to remain free of re-infection was 0.55 [95% CI: 0.46-0.63] (artesunate-amodiaquine) and 0.66 [0.57-0.73] (artemether-lumefantrine) (p = 0.017).  
0	3728070	Conclusions Both artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine were highly efficacious and artesunate-amodiaquine was non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine.
0	3728070	The proportion of patients with re-infection was high in both arms in this highly endemic setting.
0	3728070	In 2010, artesunate-amodiaquine fixed-dose combination was adopted as the first-line national treatment in Liberia.
0	3728070	Continuous efficacy monitoring is recommended.

0	5435072	Background Gastroesophageal reflux (Gastroesophageal reflux) is poorly characterized in anesthetized cats, but can cause aspiration pneumonia, esophagitis, and esophageal stricture formation.  
0	5435072	Objective To determine whether pre‐anesthetic orally administered omeprazole increases gastric and esophageal pH and increases serum gastrin concentrations in anesthetized cats, and to determine the prevalence of Gastroesophageal reflux using combined multichannel impedance and pH monitoring.  
0	5435072	Animals Twenty‐seven healthy cats undergoing elective dental procedures.  
0	5435072	Methods Prospective, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial.
0	5435072	Cats were randomized to receive 2 PO doses of omeprazole (1.45–2.20 mg/kg) or an empty gelatin capsule placebo 18–24 hours and 4 hours before anesthetic induction.
0	5435072	Blood for measurement of serum gastrin concentration was collected during anesthetic induction.
0	5435072	An esophageal pH/impedance catheter was utilized to continuously measure esophageal pH and detect Gastroesophageal reflux throughout anesthesia.  
1	5435072	Results Mean gastric pH in the cats that received omeprazole was 7.2 ± 0.4 (range, 6.6–7.8) and was significantly higher than the pH in cats that received the placebo 2.8 ± 1.0 (range, 1.3–4.1; P < .001).
0	5435072	Omeprazole administration was not associated with a significant increase in serum gastrin concentration (P = .616).
0	5435072	Nine of 27 cats (33.3%) had ≥1 episode of Gastroesophageal reflux during anesthesia.  
0	5435072	Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Pre‐anesthetic administration of 2 PO doses of omeprazole at a dosage of 1.45–2.20 mg/kg in cats was associated with a significant increase in gastric and esophageal pH within 24 hours, but was not associated with a significant increase in serum gastrin concentration.
0	5435072	Prevalence of reflux events in cats during anesthesia was similar to that of dogs during anesthesia.

0	3621778	The primary outcomes were length and body mass index for age.
0	3621778	Statistical analyses were based on linear and logistic regression models.  
0	3621778	Results 196 children in the intervention group and 263 in the control group were evaluated.
1	3621778	The intervention did not show statistically significant effects on length, but point estimates found were in the desired direction: mean difference 0.21 (95%CI −0.02; 0.44) for length-for-age Z-score and OR 0.50 (95%CI 0.22; 1.10) for stunting.
1	3621778	Significant reductions of BMI-for-age Z-score (−0.31, 95%CI −0.49; -0.12) and of BMI-for-age > 85th percentile (0.43, 95%CI 0.23; 0.77) were observed.
0	3621778	The intervention showed positive effects in some indicators of intermediary factors such as growth monitoring, health promotion activities, micronutrient supplementation, exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding.  
0	3621778	Conclusions Despite finding effect measures pointing to effects in the desired direction related to malnutrition, we could only detect a reduction in the risk of overweight attributable to the intervention.
0	3621778	The findings related to obesity prevention may be of interest in the context of the nutritional transition.
0	3621778	Given the size of this study, the results are encouraging and we believe a larger study is warranted.
0	1660570	Background The growing tendency among opioid addicts to misuse multiple other drugs should lead clinicians and researchers to search for new pharmacological strategies in order to prevent life-threatening complications and minimize withdrawal symptoms during polydrug detoxification.  
0	1660570	Methods A non-randomised, open-label in-patient detoxification study was used to compare the short-time efficacy of a standardised regimen comprising 6 days Buprenorphine and 10 days Valproate (BPN/VPA) (n = 12) to a control group (n = 50) who took a 10-day traditional Clonidine/Carbamazepine (Clonidine/Carbamazepine) regimen.
0	1660570	Sixty-two dependent subjects admitted to a detoxification unit were included, all dependent on at least opioids and benzodiazepines.
0	1660570	Other dependencies were not excluded.  
0	1660570	Results In the BPN/VPA group, 8 out of 12 patients (67%) completed treatment compared with 25 of 50 patients (50%) in the Clonidine/Carbamazepine group; this difference between the groups was non-significant (p = 0.15).
0	1660570	Withdrawal symptoms were reduced in both groups, but only the BPN/VPA group achieved a reduction in withdrawal symptoms from day one.
0	1660570	The difference between the two groups was significantly in favour of the BPN/VPA group for days 2 (p < 0.001), 3 (p < 0.05), 4 (p < 0.001), 5 (p < 0.01), 7 (p < 0.01) and 8 (p < 0.05).
0	1660570	The BPN/VPA combination did not affect blood pressure, pulse or liver function, and the total burden of side-effects was experienced as modest.
0	1660570	There appeared to be no pharmacological interactions of clinical concern, based on measurement of Buprenorphine and Valproate serum levels.
0	1660570	Both the patients and the staff were satisfied with the standardised treatment combination.  
0	1660570	Conclusion Overall, the combination of Buprenorphine and Valproate seems to be a safe and promising method for treating multiple drug withdrawal symptoms.
0	1660570	The results of this study suggest that the BPN/VPA combination is potentially a better detoxification treatment for polydrug withdrawal than the traditional treatment with Clonidine and Carbamazepine.
0	1660570	However, a randomised, double-blind study with a larger sample size to confirm our results is recommended.

0	3757791	Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid (tranexamic acid) on the intra-operative bleeding during the functional endoscopic sinus surgery (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) in children.  
0	3757791	Methods: A total of 100 children recruited to undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery were randomized into two groups.
0	3757791	Group I: Was given just after induction, intra-venous 25 mg/kg tranexamic acid diluted in 10 ml of normal saline.
0	3757791	Group II: Was given 10 ml of normal saline.
0	3757791	Non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, and quality of the surgical field were estimated every 15 min.
0	3757791	Volume of bleeding and duration of the surgical procedure were recorded.  
1	3757791	Results: Surgical field quality after 15 min revealed that seven patients in group I had minimal bleeding versus no one in group II, P=0.006.
1	3757791	Meanwhile, 35 patients in group I had mild bleeding versus 26 patients in group II, P=0.064.
1	3757791	Higher number of patients in group II than in group I had moderate bleeding, P=0006.
1	3757791	Also, at 30 min, revealed that 10 patients in group I had minimal bleeding versus one patient in group II, P=0.004.
1	3757791	Meanwhile, 37 patients in group I had mild bleeding versus 28 patients in group II, P=0.059.
0	3757791	Higher number of patients in group II than in group I had moderate bleeding, P<0001.
1	3757791	Duration of the surgeries and volume of bleeding were significantly less in tranexamic group than the placebo group, P<0.0001.  
0	3757791	Conclusion: Single intra-venous bolus dose of tranexamic in children during the functional endoscopic sinus surgery improves quality of surgical field, reduces intra-operative bleeding, and duration of surgery.
0	3493833	BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a common endocrine disorder of reproductive age women.
0	3493833	Many controlled ovarian stimulation (controlled ovarian stimulation) strategies have been offered for the treatment of patients with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization, but the optimal protocol is still a controversy.
0	3493833	There is no compelling evidence for the advantage of one stimulation protocol over the other.  
0	3493833	MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center prospective controlled study comparing long agonist and antagonist protocol in PCOS women.  
1	3493833	RESULTS: There was no significant difference in live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate.
1	3493833	Rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was significantly higher in the agonist group.
1	3493833	Number of oocytes retrieved, number of follicles and peak estradiol levels were significantly more in the agonist group.  
0	3493833	CONCLUSION: The GnRH antagonist protocol is an equally effective but safer protocol in PCOS patients compared with the long agonist protocol.
0	3590693	Background: Due to symptoms and its complications, menopause influences the mental, psychological and physical health, social performance and familial relationships.
0	3590693	Because of the undesirable side effects of hormone replacement therapy, tendency and desire toward alternative treatments in relieving menopausal symptoms have increased.
0	3590693	Among the alternative therapies are herbs and among those, herbs with phytoestrogens are more preferable.
0	3590693	Red clover is a rich source of phytoestrogens.
0	3590693	The present study investigated the effect of red clover on quality of life in post-menopausal women.  
0	3590693	Materials and Methods: In a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 72 menopausal women who at least obtained 15 scores in Kupperman Menopausal Index, after two weeks of monitoring, were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or 45 mg of red clover isoflavones for eight weeks.
0	3590693	Before the treatment and at the end of the study, menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire) was completed in the two groups.  
0	3590693	Findings: A total of 55 women completed the study, 28 subjects in red clover and 27 in placebo group.
1	3590693	Mean score of total quality of life (p < 0.001 in both groups), mean score of quality of life in vasomotor domain (p < 0.001 in both groups), psycho-social domain (p < 0.001 in red clover and p = 0.02 in placebo group) and physical domain (p < 0.001 red clover and p = 0.01 placebo group) significantly reduced compared to the baseline values.
1	3590693	However, the differences between two groups were significant neither for total quality of life nor for its domains.
0	3590693	Red clover had no side effects and all the subjects in the red clover group were satisfied with the prescribed administration Conclusions: In the present study, the effect of red clover supplementation on menopausal women's quality of life showed no difference with the placebo.
0	3590693	Further clinical trials are recommended.
0	5769199	Context: Different types of breathing exercises have varied effects on cardiovascular parameters and the stress levels in an individual.  
0	5769199	Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a modified form of isolated alternate nostril, slow breathing exercise on perceived stress, and cardiovascular parameters in young, male volunteers.  
0	5769199	Settings and Design: This was a randomized control study carried out at Advanced Centre for Yoga Therapy Education and Research, Department of Physiology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry in 2014.  
0	5769199	Subjects and Methods: Hundred healthy male volunteers were randomized into control group, n = 50 and slow breathing group (study), n = 50.
0	5769199	Slow breathing exercise training was given to study group for 30 min a day, 5 times/week for 12 weeks, under the supervision of certified yoga trainers.
0	5769199	Perceived Stress Scale (Perceived Stress Scale) using Cohen's questionnaire, anthropometric parameters such as body mass index (body mass index), waist-hip ratio (waist-hip ratio), and cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate (heart rate), systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure), and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure) were recorded at baseline and after 12 weeks.
0	5769199	The control group did not receive any intervention.
0	5769199	Slow breathing exercise training was provided for the study group.
0	5769199	During the study period, one volunteer opted out of the study group due to personal reasons.  
1	5769199	Results: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and Perceived Stress Scale decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the study group following 12 weeks slow breathing exercise training, while no significant change (P > 0.05) was observed in body mass index and waist-hip ratio.
0	5769199	There was no significant change in the control group.  
0	5769199	Conclusion: Twelve weeks of modified slow breathing exercise reduced perceived stress and improved the cardiovascular parameters.
0	5769199	The above results indicate that our modified slow breathing exercise is effective in reducing stress and improving the cardiovascular parameters.
0	4033489	Background We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of canakinumab versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus).  
0	4033489	Methods Data were pooled from three studies in 1026 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with different routes of administration, treatment regimens and follow-up duration.
0	4033489	Canakinumab groups were categorised as low (0.03 mg/kg i.v.
0	4033489	once; N = 20), intermediate (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v.
0	4033489	once, 5 and 15 mg s.c.
0	4033489	monthly; N = 247), medium (1.5 mg/kg i.v.
0	4033489	once, 50 mg s.c.
0	4033489	monthly and 150 mg s.c.
0	4033489	once; N = 268), and high doses (10 mg/kg i.v.
0	4033489	once and 150 mg s.c.
0	4033489	monthly; N = 137) and compared with placebo (N = 354).
0	4033489	Incidences of adverse events (adverse events), serious adverse events (serious AEs), discontinuations due to adverse events, deaths, adverse events of special interest related to interleukin-1β inhibition and type 2 diabetes mellitus disease, and laboratory abnormalities related to haematology and biochemistry parameters were reported.
0	4033489	Safety was also analysed by age (<65, ≥65) and gender.  
0	4033489	Results Average exposure across all groups was ≈ 6 months (maximum ~17 months).
0	4033489	No dose response in adverse events was observed but a trend towards more patients having at least one AE across canakinumab groups relative to placebo (P = 0.0152) was observed.
0	4033489	serious AEs were few and the incidence rate for most canakinumab groups was lower than that of placebo group except for the high-dose group (0.94% versus 0.58% per month in placebo).
0	4033489	A total of five patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events across treatment groups.
0	4033489	No death was reported in any of the three studies.
0	4033489	A small, non-significant increase in the incidence rate of infection adverse events was observed on canakinumab groups relative to placebo.
0	4033489	Canakinumab was associated with mostly mild decreases in WBC, neutrophils and platelet counts.
0	4033489	Additionally, mild increases in SGPT, SGOT and bilirubin were reported.
0	4033489	Overall, despite small differences, no clinically relevant findings were observed with respect to laboratory values and vital signs.  
0	4033489	Conclusions This pooled analysis demonstrated that canakinumab was safe and well tolerated over a treatment period up to 1.4 years at the four pooled doses evaluated, in agreement with safety findings reported in the individual studies.
0	3636802	Background Participant engagement influences treatment effectiveness, but it is unknown which intervention design features increase treatment engagement for online smoking cessation programs.  
0	3636802	Objective We explored the effects of 4 design features (ie, factors) on early engagement with an Internet-based, motivational smoking cessation program.  
0	3636802	Methods Smokers (N=1865) were recruited from a large health care organization to participate in an online intervention study, regardless of their interest in quitting smoking.
0	3636802	The program was intended to answer smokers’ questions about quitting in an effort to motivate and support cessation.
0	3636802	Consistent with the screening phase in the multiphase optimization strategy (multiphase optimization strategy), we used a 2-level, full-factorial design.
0	3636802	Each person was randomized to 1 of 2 levels of each factor, including message tone (prescriptive vs motivational), navigation autonomy (dictated vs not), proactive email reminders (yes vs no), and inclusion of personally tailored testimonials (yes vs no).
0	3636802	The effects of each factor level on program engagement during the first 2 months of enrollment were compared, including number of visits to the website resulting in intervention content views (as opposed to supplemental content views), number of intervention content areas viewed, number of intervention content pages viewed, and duration of time spent viewing this content, as applicable to each factor.  
1	3636802	Results Adjusting for baseline readiness to quit, persons who received content written in a prescriptive tone made the same number of visits to the website as persons receiving content in a motivational tone, but viewed 1.17 times as many content areas (95% CI 1.08-1.28; P<.001) and 1.15 times as many pages (95% CI 1.04-1.28; P=.009).
1	3636802	Time spent viewing materials did not differ among groups (P=.06).
1	3636802	Persons required to view content in a dictated order based on their initial readiness to quit made the same number of visits as people able to freely navigate the site, but viewed fewer content areas (ratio of means 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87; P<.001), 1.17 times as many pages (95% CI 1.06-1.31; P=.003), and spent 1.37 times more minutes online (95% CI 1.17-1.59; P<.001).
1	3636802	Persons receiving proactive email reminders made 1.20 times as many visits (95% CI 1.09-1.33; P<.001), viewed a similar number of content areas as persons receiving no reminders, viewed 1.58 times as many pages (95% CI 1.48-1.68; P<.001), and spent 1.51 times as many minutes online (95% CI 1.29-1.77; P<.001) as those who did not receive proactive emails.
1	3636802	Tailored testimonials did not significantly affect engagement.  
0	3636802	Conclusions Using a prescriptive message tone, dictating content viewing order, and sending reminder emails each resulted in greater program engagement relative to the contrasting level of each experimental factor.
0	3636802	The results require replication, but suggest that a more directive interaction style may be preferable for online cessation programs.

0	4809130	Background: Pregnancy is associated with unfavorable metabolic profile, which might in turn result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
0	4809130	The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of calcium plus Vitamin D administration on metabolic status and pregnancy outcomes in healthy pregnant women.  
0	4809130	Methods: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed among 42 pregnant women aged 18–40 years who were at week 25 of gestation.
0	4809130	Subjects were randomly allocated to consume either 500 mg calcium-200 IU cholecalciferol supplements (n = 21) or placebo (n = 21) for 9 weeks.
0	4809130	Blood samples were obtained at the onset of the study and after 9-week trial to determine related markers.
0	4809130	Post-delivery, the newborn's weight, length, and head circumference were measured during the first 24 h after birth.  
0	4809130	Results: Consumption of calcium-Vitamin D co-supplements resulted in a significant reduction of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels compared with placebo (−1856.8 ± 2657.7 vs. 707.1 ± 3139.4 μg/mL, P = 0.006).
0	4809130	We also found a significant elevation of plasma total antioxidant capacity (89.3 ± 118.0 vs. −9.4 ± 164.9 mmol/L, P = 0.03), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (2.5 ± 3.5 vs. −1.7 ± 1.7 ng/mL, P < 0.0001), and calcium levels (0.6 ± 0.6 vs. −0.1 ± 0.4 mg/dL, P < 0.0001).
0	4809130	The supplementation led to a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (−1.9 ± 8.3 vs. 3.1 ± 5.2 mmHg, P = 0.02) compared with placebo.
0	4809130	No significant effect of calcium-Vitamin D co-supplements was seen on other metabolic profiles.
0	4809130	We saw no significant change of the co-supplementation on pregnancy outcomes as well.  
0	4809130	Conclusions: Although calcium-Vitamin D co-supplementation for 9 weeks in pregnant women resulted in improved metabolic profiles, it did not affect pregnancy outcomes.
0	60660	Background Photodegradation of certain vitamins such as riboflavins, carotinoids, tocopherol, and folate has been well-documented.
0	60660	Previous observations suggest that ultraviolet (ultraviolet) radiation may cause folate deficiency.
0	60660	This is of great importance since folate deficiency is also known to be linked with the development of neural tube defects.
0	60660	To investigate the influence of UVA radiation on serum folate levels in vivo, we conducted a two-group randomised controlled trial on healthy subjects.  
0	60660	Material and methods Twenty-four healthy volunteers with skin type II were enrolled into the study.
0	60660	Eight volunteers of the study population were randomly assigned to the control group.
0	60660	UVA irradiation was administered with an air-conditioned sunbed.
0	60660	Blood samples were taken from all volunteers at baseline (T1), 30 min after the first UVA exposure (T2), and at the end of the study 24 h after the sixth ultraviolet exposure (T3).
0	60660	The volunteers had two UVA exposures weekly within three weeks (cumulative UVA dose: 96 J/cm2).
0	60660	Volunteers of the control group had no UVA exposures.
0	60660	Serum folate was analysed with an automated immunoassay system.  
0	60660	Results At all times of blood collection the differences between serum folate levels were insignificant (P > 0.05), except of the non-exposed controls at T2 (P < 0.05).
0	60660	We did not observed significant differences of folate levels between UVA exposed and non-exposed volunteers (P > 0.05).  
0	60660	Conclusions Our data suggest that both single and serial UVA exposures do not significantly influence serum folate levels of healthy subjects.
0	60660	Therefore, neural tube defects claimed to occur after periconceptual UVA exposure are probably not due to UVA induced folate deficiency.
0	4132095	Introduction Cardiac surgery is accompanied by an increase of oxidative stress, a significantly reduced antioxidant (antioxidant) capacity, postoperative inflammation, all of which may promote the development of organ dysfunction and an increase in mortality.
0	4132095	Selenium is an essential co-factor of various antioxidant enzymes.
0	4132095	We hypothesized a less pronounced decrease of circulating selenium levels in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (off-pump coronary artery bypass) surgery due to less intraoperative oxidative stress.  
0	4132095	Methods In this prospective randomised, interventional trial, 40 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned to undergo either on-pump or OPCAB-surgery, if both techniques were feasible for the single patient.
0	4132095	Clinical data, myocardial damage assessed by myocard specific creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), circulating whole blood levels of selenium, oxidative stress assessed by asymmetric dimethylarginine (asymmetric dimethylarginine) levels, antioxidant capacity determined by glutathionperoxidase (glutathionperoxidase) levels and perioperative inflammation represented by interleukin-6 (interleukin-6) levels were measured at predefined perioperative time points.  
1	4132095	Results At end of surgery, both groups showed a comparable decrease of circulating selenium concentrations.
1	4132095	Likewise, levels of oxidative stress and interleukin-6 were comparable in both groups.
0	4132095	Selenium levels correlated with antioxidant capacity (glutathionperoxidase: r = 0.720; p<0.001) and showed a negative correlation to myocardial damage (CK-MB: r = −0.571, p<0.001).
0	4132095	Low postoperative selenium levels had a high predictive value for the occurrence of any postoperative complication.  
0	4132095	Conclusions off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is not associated with less oxidative stress and a better preservation of the circulating selenium pool than on-pump surgery.
0	4132095	Low postoperative selenium levels are predictive for the development of complications.

0	5815470	Objective The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic effect and tolerance profile of acupuncture versus intravenous (intravenous) titrated morphine in patients presenting to the emergency department (emergency department) with renal colic.  
0	5815470	Materials and methods A total of 115 patients were randomized into two groups.
0	5815470	Patients in the intravenous titrated-morphine group (n=61) received 0.1 mg/kg morphine every 5 minutes until pain score dropped by at least 50% of its baseline value.
0	5815470	Patients in the acupuncture group (n=54) received an acupuncture session of 30 minutes following a prespecified protocol.
0	5815470	The visual analog scale (visual analog scale) was used to assess pain intensity at baseline and at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following the start of the treatment protocol.
0	5815470	Possible treatment side effects were also recorded.  
0	5815470	Results No significant differences were found between the two groups concerning age, sex, or baseline visual analog scale score.
0	5815470	From the 10th minute until the end of the intervention, acupuncture was associated with a deeper analgesic effect than titrated morphine (P<0.05 from the 10th minute and over).
1	5815470	Analgesia was also faster in the acupuncture group, with time to obtain 50% reduction of baseline visual analog scale of 14 minutes in the acupuncture group versus 28 minutes in the intravenous titrated-morphine group (P<0.001).
1	5815470	Only three patients in the acupuncture group experienced minor side effects versus 42 in the morphine group (P<0.001).
0	5815470	No major side effects were observed in this study.  
0	5815470	Conclusion In emergency department patients with renal colic, acupuncture was associated with a much faster and deeper analgesic effect and a better tolerance profile in comparison with titrated intravenous morphine.
0	5951773	Objectives To compare medical students’ and residents’ knowledge retention of assessment, diagnosis and treatment procedures, as well as a learning experience, of patients with spinal trauma after training with either a Virtual Patient case or a video-recorded traditional lecture.  
0	5951773	Methods A total of 170 volunteers (85 medical students and 85 residents in orthopedic surgery) were randomly allocated (stratified for student/resident and gender) to either a video-recorded standard lecture or a Virtual Patient-based training session where they interactively assessed a clinical case portraying a motorcycle accident.
0	5951773	The knowledge retention was assessed by a test immediately following the educational intervention and repeated after a minimum of 2 months.
0	5951773	Participants’ learning experiences were evaluated with exit questionnaires.
0	5951773	A repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied on knowledge scores.
0	5951773	A total of 81% (n = 138) of the participants completed both tests.  
0	5951773	Results There was a small but significant decline in first and second test results for both groups (F(1, 135) = 18.154, p = 0.00).
1	5951773	However, no significant differences in short-term and long-term knowledge retention were observed between the two teaching methods.
0	5951773	The Virtual Patient group reported higher learning experience levels in engagement, stimulation, general perception, and expectations.  
0	5951773	Conclusions Participants’ levels engagement were reported in favor of the VP format.
0	5951773	Similar knowledge retention was achieved through either a Virtual Patient or a recorded lecture.
0	3531527	Background Minimal-flow anesthesia can meet the demands of a modern society that is more sensitive to environmental protection and economic burdens.
0	3531527	This study compared the safety and efficacy of minimal-flow desflurane anesthesia with conventional high-flow desflurane anesthesia for prolonged laparoscopic surgery.  
0	3531527	Methods Forty-six male patients (ASA physical status II or III) undergoing laparoscopic urologic surgery for more than 6 hours were randomly divided into two groups: the high-flow (high-flow) group and the minimal-flow (minimal-flow) group.
0	3531527	The high-flow group was continuously administered a fresh gas flow of 4 L/min.
0	3531527	In the minimal-flow group, a fresh gas flow of 4 L/min was administered for the first 20 minutes and was thereafter lowered to 0.5 L/min.
0	3531527	Inspiratory and expiratory desflurane concentrations, respiratory variables, and hemodynamic variables were continuously monitored during administration of anesthesia.
0	3531527	Measurements of carboxyhemoglobin (carboxyhemoglobin) concentration and arterial blood gas analysis were performed every 2 hours during anesthesia.
0	3531527	Serum aspartate aminotransferase (aspartate aminotransferase), alanine aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase), blood urea nitrogen (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine were measured on the first and second day after the surgery.  
0	3531527	Results Demographic data and duration of anesthesia were not different between the two groups.

0	4419514	Background The Airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope are commonly used in many airway scenarios.
0	4419514	However, their features have not been fully described for double-lumen tube intubation.
0	4419514	A prospective randomized study was designed to compare their intubation performances in thoracic surgery patients.  
0	4419514	Methods Seventy ASA physical status I and II patients with predicted normal airway were scheduled for thoracic surgeries with double-lumen tube intubation.
0	4419514	They were randomly assigned to one of two groups and intubated with either the Airtraq laryngoscope (group A, n = 35) or the GlideScope (group G, n = 35).
0	4419514	Airway assessments were performed prior to anesthesia, and all patients were induced with a standard anesthetic regimen.
0	4419514	The Cormack-Lehane grades were initially evaluated with a Macintosh laryngoscope and subsequently with the group-specific laryngoscope before intubation.
0	4419514	Intubation time was recorded as the primary outcome.
0	4419514	The Cormack-Lehane grade, the success of the first intubation attempt, the intubation difficulty scales and ease of tube advancement were noted.
0	4419514	Hemodynamic variables during intubation and incidence of post-operative sore throat were documented as well.  
1	4419514	Results The intubation time of group A was shorter than that of group G (36.6 ± 20.2 s vs. 54.6 ± 25.7 s, p = 0.002).
1	4419514	The Cormack-Lehane grade (I/II/III/IV) was significantly better in group A (33/2/0/0 vs. 28/7/0/0, p = 0.042).
1	4419514	The mean arterial pressure and heart rate rose to higher levels during intubation with the GlideScope than with the Airtraq laryngoscope.
1	4419514	The success of the first intubation attempt and the intubation difficulty scales were comparable between the two groups.
1	4419514	The numbers of patients who experienced postoperative sore throat were similar (6 vs. 8) in the two groups.  
0	4419514	Conclusions Compared with the GlideScope, the specially designed Airtraq laryngoscope might be more suitable for double-lumen tube intubations in patients with predicted normal airway.

0	3024329	OBJECTIVE This study compared the durability of glycemic control of twice-daily insulin lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25: 75% insulin lispro protamine suspension/25% lispro) and once-daily insulin glargine, added to oral antihyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes patients.  
0	3024329	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS During the initiation phase, patients were randomized to LM75/25 or glargine.
0	3024329	After 6 months, patients with A1C ≤7.0% advanced to the maintenance phase for ≤24 months.
0	3024329	The primary objective was the between-group comparison of duration of maintaining the A1C goal.  
0	3024329	RESULTS Of 900 patients receiving LM75/25 and 918 patients receiving glargine who completed initiation, 473 and 419, respectively, had A1C ≤7.0% and continued into maintenance.
0	3024329	Baseline characteristics except age were similar in this group.
1	3024329	Median time of maintaining the A1C goal was 16.8 months for LM75/25 (95% CI 14.0–19.7) and 14.4 months for glargine (95% CI 13.4–16.8; P = 0.040).
0	3024329	A1C goal was maintained in 202 LM75/25-treated patients (43%) and in 147 glargine-treated patients (35%; P = 0.006).
1	3024329	No differences were observed in overall, nocturnal, or severe hypoglycemia.
1	3024329	LM75/25 patients had higher total daily insulin dose (0.45 ± 0.21 vs. 0.37 ± 0.21 units/kg/day) and more weight gain (5.4 ± 5.8 vs. 3.7 ± 5.6 kg) from baseline.
0	3024329	Patients taking LM75/25 and glargine with lower baseline A1C levels were more likely to maintain the A1C goal (P = 0.043 and P < 0.001, respectively).  
0	3024329	CONCLUSIONS A modestly longer durability of glycemic control was achieved with LM75/25 compared with glargine.
0	3024329	Patients with lower baseline A1C levels were more likely to maintain the goal, supporting the concept of earlier insulin initiation.
0	5801522	Background One in five Canadians experience mental health issues with those in the age range of 15 to 24 years being most at risk of a mood disorder.
0	5801522	University students have shown significantly higher rates of mental health problems than the general public.
0	5801522	Current university support services are limited by factors such as available staff and finances, and social stigma has frequently been identified as an additional barrier that prevents students from accessing these resources.
0	5801522	Mobile health (Mobile health) apps are one form of alternative health support that is discrete and accessible to students, and although they are recognized as a promising alternative, there is limited research demonstrating their efficacy.  
0	5801522	Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate a mindfulness-based app’s (“DeStressify”) efficacy on stress, anxiety, depressive symptomology, sleep behavior, work or class absenteeism, work or school productivity, and quality of life (quality of life) among university students.  
0	5801522	Methods Full-time undergraduate students at a Canadian university with smartphones and Internet access were recruited through in-class announcements and on-campus posters.
0	5801522	Participants randomized into an experimental condition were given and instructed to use the DeStressify app 5 days a week for 4 weeks.
0	5801522	Control condition participants were wait-listed.
0	5801522	All participants completed pre- and postintervention Web-based surveys to self-assess stress, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, sleep quality, and health-related QoL.  Results A total of 206 responses were collected at baseline, with 163 participants completing the study (86 control, 77 experimental).
1	5801522	Using DeStressify was shown to reduce trait anxiety (P=.01) and improve general health (P=.001), energy (P=.01), and emotional well-being (P=.01) in university students, and more participants in the experimental condition believed their productivity improved between baseline and postintervention measurements than the number of participants expected to believe so randomly by chance (P=.01).
1	5801522	The app did not significantly improve stress, state anxiety, physical and social functioning, and role limitations because of physical or emotional health problems or pain (P>.05).  
0	5801522	Conclusions Mindfulness-based apps may provide an effective alternative support for university students’ mental health.
0	5801522	Universities and other institutions may benefit from promoting the use of DeStressify or other mindfulness-based Mobile health apps among students who are interested in methods of anxiety management or mindfulness-based self-driven health support.
0	5801522	Future steps include examining DeStressify and similar Mobile health apps over a longer period and in university staff and faculty.
0	3685784	Objective: Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful cramps during menstruation with no pelvic pathology.
0	3685784	Due to the adverse effects of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) are considered as the most common pharmacological treatment for this disorder.
0	3685784	The present study was conducted to assess the impact of Shirazi Thymus Vulgaris compared to that of Ibuprofen on primary dysmenorrhea.  
0	3685784	Materials and Methods: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was conducted amongst 120 female students ofIlam University of Medical Sciences, aged 18-25 years who suffered from primary dysmenorrhea.
0	3685784	The participants were randomly divided into two groups; one received the herbal and the other classical treatments.
0	3685784	The herbal group received 5 ml of the Shirazi Thymus Vulgaris medication that commercially called BronchoT.D, orally four times a day.
0	3685784	The classic group received Ibuprofen orally three times a day.
0	3685784	A visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale) was used to record pain severity.  
0	3685784	Results: Pain severity was reduced in both herbal and classic groups with no significant differences.
1	3685784	Pain duration at the first and second month of treatment was also similar between two groups.  
0	3685784	Conclusions: Shirazi Thymus Vulgaris decreased dysmenorrhea symptoms, which might be attributed to its antispasmodic effects.
0	3685784	The herbal Shirazi Thymus Vulgaris can be recommended as an effective medication fortreatment of the primary dysmenorrhea disorder.
0	5752785	Background and Aims: The external jugular vein (external jugular vein), often used for resuscitation, has been underutilised for central venous catheterisation (central venous catheterisation) in view of an unpredictable success rate.
0	5752785	There is an encouraging literature on the improved success rate of central venous catheterisation through external jugular vein with the inclusion of certain body manoeuvres.
0	5752785	This prospective randomised controlled study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of body manoeuvres in improving the success rate of central venous catheterisation through external jugular vein.  
0	5752785	Methods: One hundred patients aged 18–50 years, scheduled for elective surgery requiring central venous catheterisation, were randomly assigned to either undergo central venous catheterisation using Seldinger technique with body manoeuvres or a control group undergoing central venous catheterisation without body manoeuvres.
0	5752785	The primary outcome was the success rate of central venous catheterisation, as observed in the post-procedure chest radiograph.
0	5752785	Secondary outcomes included quality of central venous pressure waveform, catheterisation attempts, total time for central venous catheterisation, complications.  
1	5752785	Results: central venous catheterisation was achieved in 98% (49/50) of patients in study group and 80% (40/50) of patients in control group (P = 0.008).
1	5752785	Mean catheterisation time was significantly lower in the study group (151.06 ± 40.50 s) compared to control group (173.50 ± 50.66 s) (P = 0.023).
1	5752785	The incidence of catheter misplacement and failure to cannulate were lower in the study group (0%, 2% vs. 20%, 12.5%, respectively).
1	5752785	Groups did not differ in a number of catheterisation attempts and incidence of haematoma.  
0	5752785	Conclusion: Inclusion of various body manoeuvres to Seldinger technique significantly improves the success rate of central venous catheterisation through external jugular vein.
0	3562170	Background This study compared the effects of ingesting water (water), a flavored carbohydrate-electrolyte (carbohydrate-electrolyte) or a flavored non-caloric electrolyte (non-caloric electrolyte) beverage on mood, ratings of perceived exertion (ratings of perceived exertion), and sprint power during cycling in recreational exercisers.  
0	3562170	Methods Men (n = 23) and women (n = 13) consumed a 24–h standardized diet and reported 2–4 h post-prandial for all test sessions.
0	3562170	After a familiarization session, participants completed 50 min of stationary cycling in a warm environment (wet bulb globe temperature = 25.0°C) at ~ 60-65% of heart rate reserve (146 ± 4 bpm) interspersed with 5 rest periods of 2 min each.
0	3562170	During exercise, participants consumed water, carbohydrate-electrolyte, or non-caloric electrolyte, served in a counterbalanced cross-over design.
0	3562170	Beverage volume was served in 3 aliquots equaling each individual’s sweat losses (mean 847 ± 368 mL) during the familiarization session.
0	3562170	Profiles of Mood States questionnaires (Profiles of Mood States questionnaires) were administered and blood glucose levels were determined pre- and post- sub-maximal cycling.
0	3562170	Following sub-maximal exercise, participants completed 3 30–s Wingate anaerobic tests (Wingate anaerobic tests) with 2.5 min rest between tests to assess performance.  
1	3562170	Results Blood glucose was higher (p <  0.05) after 50 min of submaximal cycling just prior to the Wingate anaerobic tests for carbohydrate-electrolyte (6.1 ± 1.7 mmol/L) compared to water (4.9 ± 1.5 mmol/L) and non-caloric electrolyte (4.6 ± 1.2 mmol/L).
1	3562170	Nonetheless, there were no differences among treatments in peak (642 ± 153, 635 ± 143, 650 ± 141 watts for water, non-caloric electrolyte, and carbohydrate-electrolyte, respectively; p  =  0.44) or mean (455 ± 100, 458 ± 95, 454 ± 95 watts for water, non-caloric electrolyte, and carbohydrate-electrolyte, respectively; p = 0.62) power for the first Wingate anaerobic tests or mean (414 ± 92, 425 ± 85, 423 ± 82 watts, respectively; p = 0.13) power output averaged across all 3 WAnT.
1	3562170	Likewise, ratings of perceived exertion during submaximal exercise, session ratings of perceived exertion, and fatigue and vigor assessed by Profiles of Mood States questionnaires did not differ among beverage treatments (p > 0.05).  
0	3562170	Conclusions Carbohydrate ingestion consumed by recreational exercisers during a 1–h, moderate-intensity aerobic workout did not alter mood or perceived exertion, nor did it affect subsequent anaerobic performance under the conditions of this study.
0	3562170	Drinking caloric sport beverages does not benefit recreational exercisers in a non-fasted state.
0	1523225	Objective: Previous studies suggested that slow injection of propofol may increase the hypnotic effect during induction of anesthesia.
0	1523225	The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether injection rate of propofol has an influence on its maximum effect.  
0	1523225	Design: Randomized, single-blind trial.  
0	1523225	Setting: This study has been carried out in the operating rooms of a university hospital.
0	1523225	An anesthesiologist and a resident performed the study with the aid of changing nursing staff.  
0	1523225	Participants: We investigated 99 unpremedicated patients aged 18 to 60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status 1–3.  
0	1523225	Interventions: Anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol (2 mg/kg).
0	1523225	Propofol was manually injected in group 1 over a period of 5 s; in group 2 (120-s injection interval), and in group 3 (240-s injection interval), propofol was administered by an injection pump.
0	1523225	After loss of consciousness, mask ventilation was performed with 100% oxygen.
0	1523225	Bispectral index (Bispectral index) was used to measure the hypnotic effect of propofol.
0	1523225	After the decrease of Bispectral index to the minimum value (i.e., maximum hypnotic effect) and the following increase of Bispectral index to 60, the study period was finished and anesthesia was performed according to clinical criteria.  
0	1523225	Outcome Measures: We analyzed whether injection speed has an influence on the maximum hypnotic effect of a given dose of propofol (2 mg/kg).  
0	1523225	Results: BISmin marks the maximum electroencephalogram (electroencephalogram) effect of the propofol bolus as measured by the Bispectral index.
1	1523225	The lowest mean BISmin was measured in group 1 (28.7 ± 10.3).
1	1523225	In group 2, BISmin was 33.0 (±13.9), and in group 3, BISmin was 36.4 (±11.0).
1	1523225	There were no significant differences between group 2 and groups 1 or 3, but there were significant differences between groups 1 and 3.
1	1523225	In group 1, BISmin was reached after 102.91 s (±44.20), in group 2 after 172.33 s (±29.76), and in group 3 after 274.21 s (±45.40).
1	1523225	These differences were statistically significant for all comparisons.
1	1523225	In summary, the lowest value for BISmin was achieved in the group with the fastest rate of propofol injection (group1, 5 s).
0	1523225	The highest BISmin was obtained in the group with the slowest rate of injection (group 3, 240 s).
0	1523225	The hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different among groups.  
0	1523225	Conclusions: The hypnotic peak effect of propofol is lower with extremely slow injection (240 s versus 5 s).
0	1523225	For clinically usual injection rates (5 s and 120 s), there was no significant difference in propofol peak effect.
0	4776353	Background Explicit consideration of anticipated regret is not part of the standard shared decision-making protocols.
0	4776353	This pilot study aimed to compare decisions about a hypothetical surgery for breast cancer and examined whether regret is a consideration in treatment decisions.  
0	4776353	Methods In this randomized experimental study, 184 healthy female volunteers were randomized to receive a standard decision aid (control) or one with information on post-surgical regret (experimental).
0	4776353	The main outcome measures were the proportion of subjects choosing lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and the proportion reporting that regret played a role in the decision made.
0	4776353	We hypothesized that a greater proportion of the experimental group (regret-incorporated decision aid) would make a surgical treatment preference that favored the less regret-inducing option and that they would be more likely to consider regret in their decision-making process as compared to the control group.  
0	4776353	Results A significantly greater proportion of the experimental group subjects reported regret played a role in their decision-making process compared to the control counterparts (78 vs. 65 %; p = 0.039).
1	4776353	Recipients of the regret-incorporated experimental decision aid had a threefold increased odds of choosing the less regret-inducing surgery (OR = 2.97; 95 % CI = 1.25, 7.09; p value = 0.014).  
0	4776353	Conclusions In this hypothetical context, the incorporation of regret in a decision aid for preference-sensitive surgery impacted decision-making.
0	4776353	This finding suggests that keying in on anticipated regret may be an important element of shared decision-making strategies.
0	4776353	Our results make a strong argument for applying this design and pursuing further research in a surgical patient population.
