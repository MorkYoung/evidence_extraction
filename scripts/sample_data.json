[{"pmid": "15758829", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nIn the prostate testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzymes 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) types 1 and 2 (5alphaR1 and 5alphaR2). Suppression of DHT formation by 5alphaR inhibition may be beneficial in early treatment or prevention of prostate cancer. Although 5alphaR2 is the dominant enzyme in the prostate, evidence indicates that 5alphaR1 may be up-regulated in some prostate cancers. This suggests that dual inhibition of both isoenzymes may be more effective than suppression of 5alphaR2 alone in prostate cancer treatment or prevention. In this short-term pilot study we examined the effect of the dual 5alphaR inhibitor dutasteride on markers of tumor regression.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 46 men with clinically staged T1 or T2 prostate cancer were randomized to receive 5 mg per day of placebo or dutasteride for 6 to 10 weeks before radical prostatectomy. Resected tissues were analyzed to determine the effect of dutasteride on intraprostatic androgen levels, and indices of apoptosis and microvessel density (MVD) in malignant tissue, as well as degree of atrophy in benign tissue.\nRESULTS\nTreatment with dutasteride caused a 97% decrease in intraprostatic DHT and was associated with a trend toward increased apoptosis. In patients receiving dutasteride for 45 days or more, a significant increase in apoptosis and a trend toward decreased MVD in prostate cancer tissue was observed. Dutasteride treatment was also associated with an 18% decrease in mean benign epithelial cell width compared with placebo (p < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this pilot study dutasteride treatment resulted in almost complete suppression of intraprostatic DHT, increased apoptosis and a trend toward decreased MVD.

Two hundred and twenty-six patients have been entered. All patients received four cycles of cyclophosphamide (750 mg m-2), doxorubicin (40 mg m-2) and vincristine (1.4 mg m-2) on Day 1 and etoposide (75 mg m-2) on Days 1, 2 and 3, repeated at 21 day intervals.

SCLC is associated with alterations in the coagulation system. The present randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to determine whether addition of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to combination chemotherapy (CT) would improve SCLC outcome compared with CT alone.\nMETHODS\nCombination CT consisted of cyclophosphamide, epirubicine and vincristine (CEV) given at 3-weekly intervals for six cycles. Eighty-four patients were randomized to receive either CT alone (n = 42) or CT plus LMWH (n = 42). LMWH consisted of dalteparin given at a dose of 5000 U once daily during the 18 weeks of CT. Results Overall tumor response rates were 42.5% with CT alone and 69.2% with CT plus LMWH (P = 0.07). Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months with CT alone and 10.0 months with CT plus LMWH (P = 0.01).
