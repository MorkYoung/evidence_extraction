frovatriptan	rizatriptan	The proportion of patients who were pain-free at 4 hours without rescue medication	1473	1630	The proportion of patients who were pain-free at 4 hours without rescue medication was higher in the frovatriptan-treated group, (38.9 versus 5.6%, P=0.045).
frovatriptan	rizatriptan	cumulative hazard of migraine recurrence	18982	19103	significantly lower cumulative hazard of migraine recurrence (P=0.04) over 72 hours in patients treated with frovatriptan
frovatriptan	rizatriptan	cumulative hazard of migraine recurrence	18931	19115	This finding was confirmed by the observation of a significantly lower cumulative hazard of migraine recurrence (P=0.04) over 72 hours in patients treated with frovatriptan (Figure 3).
frovatriptan and rizatriptan	baseline	The frequency of rescue medication	21909	22129	The frequency of rescue medication was lower in patients during frovatriptan treatment (seven of 20) compared to rizatriptan treatment (13 of 20), this difference just failing to reach statistical significance (P=0.058).
frovatriptan and rizatriptan	baseline	nausea, photophobia , and phonophobia	20717	20893	A significant reduction in patients experiencing nausea (P=0.045), photophobia (P<0.001), and phonophobia (P<0.001) was observed at 72 hours for both drugs compared to baseline
frovatriptan and rizatriptan	baseline	adverse events	2124	2228	Fewer adverse events were observed for frovatriptan compared to rizatriptan (one versus eight, P=0.021).
frovatriptan	rizatriptan	the time to maximum concentration	1276	1472	Although the time to maximum concentration was similar for both drugs (2.7 versus 2.3 hours), the terminal half-life for frovatriptan was longer than rizatriptan (29.3 versus 3.2 hours, P<0.0001).
frovatriptan and rizatriptan	baseline	nausea, photophobia , and phonophobia	20717	20908	A significant reduction in patients experiencing nausea (P=0.045), photophobia (P<0.001), and phonophobia (P<0.001) was observed at 72 hours for both drugs compared to baseline (Figure 5Bâ€“D).
