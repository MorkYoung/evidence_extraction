Cooling	Control	Electromyographic amplitude of gastrocnemius medialis	1007	1082	The mean EMG amplitude of GM muscle was increased after cooling (P < 0.003)
Cooling	Control	Electromyographic amplitude of tibialis anterior	19620	19777	The mean EMG amplitude of GM muscle was significantly increased by approximately 400 Î¼V after cooling (P < 0.003). There was no difference for the TA muscles
Cooling	Control	Electromyographic amplitude of gastrocnemius medialis	1007	1120	The mean EMG amplitude of GM muscle was increased after cooling (P < 0.003), indicating that fatigue was induced.
Cooling	Control	Isometric maximum force in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle	19392	19544	There was a significantly reduced isometric maximum force in TA muscle (P < 0.001) after cooling, and the GM muscle force difference was not significant
Cooling	Control	Third peak of coefficient of friction	20140	20306	We found no differences in the GRFs between pre- and postcooling. Neither did the third peak of coefficient of friction result in a significant difference (P = 0.851)
Cooling	Control	Third peak of coefficient of friction	20140	20317	We found no differences in the GRFs between pre- and postcooling. Neither did the third peak of coefficient of friction result in a significant difference (P = 0.851) (Table 2).
Cooling	Control	Isometric maximum force in the tibialis anterior muscle	905	1006	There was a significantly reduced isometric maximum force in the TA muscle (P < 0.001) after cooling.
Cooling	Control	Electromyographic amplitude of tibialis anterior	-1	-1	3.4. The Effects of Cooling on the EMG of Gait Muscles<NEWLINE> <NEWLINE>The average of the median for the three gait trials after cooling was significantly higher in the GM (P < 0.001) compared to the precooling value. There was no difference for the TA muscles
Cooling	Control	Gait Ground Reaction Forces	20140	20306	We found no differences in the GRFs between pre- and postcooling. Neither did the third peak of coefficient of friction result in a significant difference (P = 0.851)
