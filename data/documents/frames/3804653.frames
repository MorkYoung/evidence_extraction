MCA sphenoidal segment (M1) difficult exposure	MCA sphenoidal segment (M1) easy exposure 	M1 slope gap	13633	14172	According to our study, the M1 slope gap was 1.00 ± 0.42 mm and the mean of M1 angle was 9.36 ± 3.73°, indicating difficult to identify M1 vessels through distal to proximal sylvian fissure dissection method. So if the M1 slope gap is less than 1.42 mm or the M1 angle is less than 13.09°, proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection is preferable. For example, when the M1 slope gap was 1.31 mm and M1 angle was 10.2° in preoperative 3D-CTA, we would better using a proximal to distal sylvian fissure dissection for ease of M1 exposure.
