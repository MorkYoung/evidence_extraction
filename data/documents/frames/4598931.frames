mandibular advancement device (MAD)	Placebo device	apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)	22473	23102	Figure 2 shows the comparison of the mean AHI between the basal phase with the PD and MAD phases. This comparison revealed a significant increase in the AHI by the PD (p = 0.017) and a reduction in the AHI, although not statistically significant, was observed in the MAD phase. When both splints were compared, the use of MAD reduced significantly the AHI (p = 0.000). Figure 3 shows the results of the mean change in the AHI. An increment in the AHI by 10.6 + 26.1 was caused by the PD while a reduction by 3.4 + 15.9 was caused by the MAD. The differences between the PD and the MAD were statistically significant ( p = 0.000).
