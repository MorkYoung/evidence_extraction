relevant computer tutorial = "in sequence"	non-relevant tutorial = "out of sequence"	post-test scores	1358	1550	doing a computer tutorial in sequence resulted in significantly greater post-test scores (z-score 1.1 (SD 0.70) in sequence vs. 0.52 (1.1) out-of-sequence; 95% CI for difference +0.16, +0.93).
relevant computer tutorial = "in sequence"	non-relevant tutorial = "out of sequence"	Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) topic	21959	22234	This effect reached statistical significance for the ORS topic where students who did the tutorial in the in sequence condition scored 19% higher (95% confidence interval for the difference +7%, +31%) corresponding to a large Cohen's-d effect size of 0.85 (95% CI 0.25, 1.5).
relevant computer tutorial = "in sequence"	non-relevant tutorial = "out of sequence"	pre-test scores	1303	1348	Pre-test scores did not differ significantly.
relevant computer tutorial = "in sequence"	non-relevant tutorial = "out of sequence"	time spent on the tutorials	1551	1743	Students spent longer on the tutorials when they were done in sequence (12.1 min (SD 7.3) vs. 10.5 (6.5)) though the difference was not statistically significant (95% CI diff: -1.2 min, +4.5).
relevant computer tutorial = "in sequence"	non-relevant tutorial = "out of sequence"	Fever Without Source (FWS) topic	22235	22538	Students who did the FWS tutorial in the in sequence condition scored an average of 6% HIGHER on the post-test than the comparison group (95% confidence interval for the difference (-3%, +16%) corresponding to a Cohen's-d effect size of 0.38 (95% CI -0.20, +0.97) which is not statistically significant.
