insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose administration	1082	1254	In contrast, insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose administration were significantly greater after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.0001, respectively)
insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	Fasting glycemia	14918	15083	Fasting glucose concentrations were 179.6 ± 7.5 mg/dL before the insulin treatment and 117.6 ± 6.5 mg/dL after the 8-week basal insulin treatment period (P < 0.001),
insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose administration	17052	17277	Insulin and C-peptide levels were not significantly different before intravenous glucose administration, but the postchallenge concentrations were higher in the experiments after glargine treatment (P < 0.0001, respectively).
insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	first- and second-phase insulin secretion	1256	1386	Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion increased significantly after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.05, respectively
insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	C-peptide levels	15994	16126	There were no differences in fasting insulin or C-peptide concentrations between the experiments before and after glargine treatment
insulin glargine over 8 weeks	baseline	Fasting glycemia	771	919	Fasting glycemia was lowered from 179.6 ± 7.5 to 117.6 ± 6.5 mg/dL (P < 0.001), and HbA1c levels declined from 8.4 ± 0.5 to 7.1 ± 0.2% (P = 0.0046).
