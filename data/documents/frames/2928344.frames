Calcitriol	Placebo	Adverse events	6398	6534	Calcium and phosphate levels remained within normal limits throughout the follow-up, and no adverse events were reported in any patient.
Calcitriol	Placebo	Insulin requirements at 6, 12, and 24 months	655	780	At 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up, A1C and insulin requirement in the calcitriol group did not differ from the placebo group.

Calcitriol	Placebo	C-peptide response	779	906	. C-peptide dropped significantly (P < 0.001) but similarly in both groups, with no significant differences at each time point.
Calcitriol	Placebo	C-peptide response	5157	5497	The area under the curve of C-peptide response (AUC0–120 min) was not significantly different in the calcitriol versus placebo group at baseline (calcitriol group: 69.9 ± 24.8 nmol/l × 120 min; placebo group: 72.5 ± 37.7; P = 0.658) or after 12 months (calcitriol group: 49.7 ± 30.4 nmol/l × 120 min; placebo group: 56.2 ± 39.7; P = 0.845).
