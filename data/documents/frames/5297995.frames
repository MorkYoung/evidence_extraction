zirconia implant abutments	stock	coronal growth of approximal gingival margin on the neighboring teeth	19851	20056	There was no statistically significant difference between stock (0.24 mm; 95% CI [−0.09 mm; 0.57 mm]; SD 0.77 mm) and CAD/CAM customized abutments (0.40 mm; 95% CI [−0.01 mm; 0.81 mm] SD 0.99 mm, Table 3).
zirconia implant abutments	stock	bone apposition	19401	19652	The difference in bone apposition between the 2 groups (stock: 0.06 mm, 95% CI [−0.05 mm; 0.16 mm], standard deviation 0.23mm versus CAD/CAM customized: 0.11 mm, 95% CI [0.02 mm; 0.20 mm]; standard deviation 0.20 mm) was not statistically significant.
follow�up appointments were planned at two weeks (T 1) and 12 months (T 12) after delivery of the restoration	After the intake (T 0) and implant placement	embarrassment and problems with taste, speech, gum color, tooth color and the visibility of the implant	21335	21545	Patients experienced significantly less embarrassment and problems with taste, speech, gum color, tooth color and the visibility of the implant at T <NEWLINE>1 (p < .01) and T <NEWLINE>12 (p < .05) than they had expected at T <NEWLINE>0.
