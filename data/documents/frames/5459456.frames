ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating or ACVC	anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF)	surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating	22664	22806	No significant differences were found in surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating among ACVC, ACVC-HA, and ACCF groups.
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating or ACVC	anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF)	The stiffness	1927	2046	stiffness was significantly decreased in the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups compared with the control group and the ACCF group
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating	ACVC	new bone formation around the screws and bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections	31487	31699	In the sections located at the self-drilling fixation screw level (Fig 8E and 8G), we found significantly more new bone formation around the screws for the ACVC-HA group (Fig 8G) than for the ACVC group (Fig 8E).
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating or ACVC	anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF)	The stiffness	28479	28614	The stiffness was significantly decreased in all directions for the ACVC and ACVC-HA groups, while it was increased for the ACCF group.
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating	ACVC	new bone formation around the screws and bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections	31796	32099	These findings indicate that, compared with the ACVC group, the ACVC-HA group had a significantly higher bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections respectively located at the vertebral body component and screw level (Fig 8I), which is an appropriate index for measuring bone ingrowth into the implant.
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating	ACVC	new bone formation around the screws and bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections	31487	32099	In the sections located at the self-drilling fixation screw level (Fig 8E and 8G), we found significantly more new bone formation around the screws for the ACVC-HA group (Fig 8G) than for the ACVC group (Fig 8E). Moreover, the ACVC group had much more fibrous tissue around the screws than the ACVC-HA group. These findings indicate that, compared with the ACVC group, the ACVC-HA group had a significantly higher bone-implant contact (BIC) in both sections respectively located at the vertebral body component and screw level (Fig 8I), which is an appropriate index for measuring bone ingrowth into the implant.
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating or ACVC	control	inflexion-extension and lateral bending for the C2-C6, C2-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 segments	24905	25075	There were no significant differences among the control, ACVC, and ACVC-HA groups inflexion-extension and lateral bending for the C2-C6, C2-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 segments.
ACVC-HA - artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) with an HA biocoating or ACVC	anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF)	surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating	22664	22975	No significant differences were found in surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating among ACVC, ACVC-HA, and ACCF groups. These findings indicate that ACVC or ACVC-HA implantation did not increase surgery time, blood loss, recovery time, and time before eating compared with the ACCF group.
