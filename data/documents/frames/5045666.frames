Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and vitamin D	10636	10810	there was no significant difference in the mean level of HDL and vitamin D between the study and control groups before the intervention (P = 0.95 and P = 0.20, respectively).
Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Mean serum levels of vitamin D	12732	12912	The same correlation was found for vitamin D levels (P < 0.001). After adjustment, the level of the study group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.001).
Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and vitamin D	1571	1753	There was no statistically significant difference in the mean serum levels of HDL-C and vitamin D between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.11 and P = 0.20, respectively).
Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Mean serum levels of vitamin D	1336	1570	The mean serum levels of both HDL-C and vitamin D showed a significant rise following the treatment in the study group (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas both variables decreased slightly in the control group (P = 0.27).
Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Mean serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)	12468	12731	Based on an ANCOVA, the serum HDL levels were correlated before and after the intervention (P < 0.001). After adjustment for confounding variables, the mean serum HDL level of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P = 0.04).
Vitamin D supplement	Placebo	Mean serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)	1336	1495	The mean serum levels of both HDL-C and vitamin D showed a significant rise following the treatment in the study group (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001, respectively),
