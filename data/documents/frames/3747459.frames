Comfrey root extract + methyl nicotinate	Placebo	Pain AUC	1015	1196	The AUC of the VAS on active standardised movement was markedly smaller in the combination treatment group than in the methyl nicotinate and in the placebo group (ANOVA: p < 0.0001)
Comfrey root extract + methyl nicotinate	Methyl nicotinate	Pain AUC	1015	1197	The AUC of the VAS on active standardised movement was markedly smaller in the combination treatment group than in the methyl nicotinate and in the placebo group (ANOVA: p < 0.0001).
Comfrey root extract + methyl nicotinate	Methyl nicotinate	Pain AUC	1015	1196	The AUC of the VAS on active standardised movement was markedly smaller in the combination treatment group than in the methyl nicotinate and in the placebo group (ANOVA: p < 0.0001)
Comfrey root extract + methyl nicotinate	Methyl nicotinate	Inducible pressure pain	23255	23553	The AUC of the pressure algometry values in the trigger point was much higher in the combination group, which means significantly less inducible pressure pain than in both comparator groups (64% more compared to placebo and 19% more compared to methyl nicotinate, respectively, t-test: p < 0.0001).
