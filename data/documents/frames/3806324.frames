dorsal BMG urethroplasty by ventral urethrotomy (Group B) (Asopa)	dorsal onlay BMG urethroplasty (Group A) (Barbagli)	complication rate	15746	15815	The complication rate was found to be equal in both of the approaches
dorsal BMG urethroplasty by ventral urethrotomy (Group B) (Asopa)	dorsal onlay BMG urethroplasty (Group A) (Barbagli)	failure managed by optical internal urethrotomy (OIU)	9534	9803	On subsequent follow-up, 2 patients showed evidence of stricture at 1 year in Group B. Both of these patients were managed with OIU. There was no significant difference in the subjective symptom score, residual urine, Q <NEWLINE>max⁡, and restricture rate between the two groups
dorsal BMG urethroplasty by ventral urethrotomy (Group B) (Asopa)	dorsal onlay BMG urethroplasty (Group A) (Barbagli)	failure managed by optical internal urethrotomy (OIU)	-1	-1	In Group A, 18 patients were satisfied with surgery and had Q max⁡ greater than 25 mL/sec. One patient had persistent narrowing at the stricture site and voided with a poor stream. Patient was managed with optical internal urethrotomy (OIU).
