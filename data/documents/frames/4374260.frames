50 mg of tramadol and 100 mg of tramadol	placebo or baseline	Mean intra-vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT)	1035	1169	Mean IELT was 72 at presentation, 82 for placebo, 150 for tramadol 50 mg, and 272 for tramadol 100 mg (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).
50 mg of tramadol and 100 mg of tramadol	placebo	Weak scanty ejaculation	1755	1887	Weak scanty ejaculation was the main complaint in 7.2% versus 21.6% of those using 50 and 100 mg tramadol, respectively (P = 0.002).
50 mg of tramadol and 100 mg of tramadol	placebo 	premature ejaculation (PE).	1170	1342	PE was successfully treated in only 2.4% of patients with placebo, in contrast to 53.6% and 85.6% with 50 and 100 mg tramadol, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).
50 mg of tramadol and 100 mg of tramadol	placebo 	adverse events	11610	11773	Among the 125 patients included in the study, adverse events were noted in 3.2% with placebo, 21.6% with tramadol 50 mg and 45.6% with tramadol 100 mg (P < 0.001).
50 mg of tramadol and 100 mg of tramadol	placebo 	premature ejaculation (PE).	1343	1618	On multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline IELT was the only predictor of successful treatment of PE with both tramadol 50 mg (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.07, P < 0.001) and tramadol 100 mg (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11, P < 0.001).
