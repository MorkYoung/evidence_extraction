Nelatone catheter	Foley catheter	staphylococcal UTI	9398	9524	three cases of staphylococcal UTI were observed in the Foley group compared to only one case in the Nelatone group (P = 0.605)
Nelatone catheter	Foley catheter	staphylococcal UTI	9388	9535	Moreover, three cases of staphylococcal UTI were observed in the Foley group compared to only one case in the Nelatone group (P = 0.605) (Table 2).
Nelatone catheter	Foley catheter	rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) in rabbits	1246	1365	At the end of the study, four cases in the Nelatone group and 12 cases in the Foley group presented with UTI (P = 0.01)
Nelatone catheter	Foley catheter	rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) in rabbits	1451	1549	The Nelatone catheters, compared with the Foley ones, had a lower risk of UTI in the long term use
Nelatone catheter	Foley catheter	frequency of entrococcal infection	9202	9387	The frequency of entrococcal infection was less in the Nelatone group (3 cases) compared with the Foley group (nine cases) and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.038).
