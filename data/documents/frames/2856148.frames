Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	time spent on mechanical ventilation	14190	14377	There was no difference in the time spent on mechanical ventilation between the two groups i.e. 6.20 ± 5.20 day's vs. 7.47 ± 6.38 days in Gp I and Gp II, respectively (P > 0.05, Table 3).
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	time spent on mechanical ventilation	1277	1567	No significant difference between the two groups in duration of MV (6.20 ± 5.20 days vs. 7.47 ± 6.38 days, P > 0.05), duration of weaning (35.17 ± 16.98 and 47.05 ± 20.98 hours, P > 0.05) or duration of ICU stay (8.47 ± 4.79 and 10.80 ± 5.28 days, P > 0.05) in Gp I and Gp II, respectively.
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	duration of weaning	1277	1464	No significant difference between the two groups in duration of MV (6.20 ± 5.20 days vs. 7.47 ± 6.38 days, P > 0.05), duration of weaning (35.17 ± 16.98 and 47.05 ± 20.98 hours, P > 0.05)
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Mortality at discharge from ICU	1672	1872	Lesser number of deaths in the NIV group at discharge from ICU (3 vs. 5 patients, respectively) and at 30 days (5 vs. 9 patients, respectively), it did not achieve statistical significance (P > 0.05).
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	days spend in the ICU	1277	1534	No significant difference between the two groups in duration of MV (6.20 ± 5.20 days vs. 7.47 ± 6.38 days, P > 0.05), duration of weaning (35.17 ± 16.98 and 47.05 ± 20.98 hours, P > 0.05) or duration of ICU stay (8.47 ± 4.79 and 10.80 ± 5.28 days, P > 0.05)
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Mortality at discharge from ICU	14725	15139	Mortality at discharge from ICU, three (20% mortality) and five deaths (33.33% mortality), respectively, were observed in the NIV and PSV group at the time of ICU discharge. Nevertheless, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, Table 3). At 30 days, there were lesser number of absolute deaths in the NIV group (5 vs. 9); however, it did not achieve statistical significance (P > 0.05, Table 3)
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	duration of weaning	14378	14525	No difference in duration of weaning was observed between NIV and PSV groups (35.17 ± 16.98 and 47.05 ± 20.98 hrs, respectively, p.>0.05, Table 3).
Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	days spend in the ICU	14526	14724	Patients weaned by NIV spent nearly 2 days less in the ICU, in comparison to weaning by PSV (8.47 ± 4.79 vs. 10.80 ± 5.28 days), the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, Table 3).
