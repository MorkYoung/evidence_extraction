Acetylsalicylic acid	saline	Mean Pain intensity rating	16093	16311	Mean Pain intensity rating (±SEM) for the ASA session was 61.7 ± 2.73 and for the saline session 62.1 ± 2.71. A paired t-test comparing the average pain ratings of both sessions failed to reach significance (p > 0.05).
Acetylsalicylic acid	saline	activity of the hypothalamic area or the trigeminal nuclei	17407	17645	Additionally, no increased activation for placebo compared to ASA condition could be revealed regarding the hypothalamic area or the trigeminal nuclei. No significant differences could be revealed for the opposite contrast (ASA > Saline).
Acetylsalicylic acid	saline	activity of the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII)	-1	-1	Increased BOLD signal intensity in the anterior cingulate cortex (left) and secondary somatosensory cortex (right) during nociceptive input (ammonia > air puffs) after saline treatment compared to ASA condition.
Acetylsalicylic acid	saline	activity of the hypothalamic area or the trigeminal nuclei	1418	1527	we could not find an effect of ASA on the trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem or within the hypothalamic area.
