Oral etoposide phosphate	Oral etoposide	Median AUC(inf)	759	1123	The median AUC(inf) (area under the concentration vs time curve from zero to infinity) of etoposide was 77.7 mg l(-1) h after etoposide phosphate (95% CI 61.3-100.5) and 62.0 mg l(-1) h after oral etoposide (95% CI 52.2-76.9). The difference in favour of etoposide phosphate was borderline significant: median 9.9 mg l(-1) h (95% CI 0.1-32.8 mg l(-1) h; P = 0.05).
