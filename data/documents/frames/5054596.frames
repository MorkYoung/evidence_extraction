Indirect grasping	Combination	Force required to pick-up an object	23088	23204	the IG group required less force than the COM group in order to pick up an object (p < 0.05 in pairwise comparisons)
Indirect grasping	Direct grasping	Reach times	21713	21841	There was also a main effect of group that showed the IG group had significantly shorter reach times than the DG group (p < .03)
Indirect grasping	Direct grasping, fixation, or combination	Movement times	1457	1653	On a kinematic level movement times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups
Indirect grasping	Combination	Force required to pick-up an object	22985	23205	A large main effect of group was found for the grasp force when grasping the object, which showed that the IG group required less force than the COM group in order to pick up an object (p < 0.05 in pairwise comparisons).
Indirect grasping	Direct grasping, fixation, or combination	Movement times	1889	1980	During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping group showed advantages.
Indirect grasping	Direct grasping, fixation, or combination	Movement times	1552	1654	The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups.
Direct grasping	Control	IoF-scores improvement	-1	-1	A repeated measures ANOVA on the IoF-scores demonstrated a main effect of test, in that the four training groups and control group improved on IoF-scores on the posttest, RT1 and RT2 compared with the pretest and also improved from posttest to RT1 and RT2 (p's < .001 in pairwise comparison) (Table 1).
Indirect grasping	Direct grasping	Reach times	21756	21842	showed the IG group had significantly shorter reach times than the DG group (p < .03).
Direct grasping	Control	IoF-scores improvement	-1	-1	we plotted in Fig. 4b the difference in IoF score between the control group and each of the experimental groups. What can be seen in Fig. 4b is that the DG group showed the largest improvement compared to the controls after the training and in the first retention.
