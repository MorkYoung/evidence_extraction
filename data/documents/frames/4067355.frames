edoxaban 	rivaroxaban	risk of stroke	22279	22493	There were no significant differences between the higher dose of edoxaban (60 mg) and any other NOAC in the efficacy outcomes, apart from a slightly higher risk of stroke with edoxaban than rivaroxaban (p = 0.032).
non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)	placebo	the risk of stroke, all-cause mortality	895	1066	Compared to imputed placebo, all NOACs reduced the risk of stroke (ORs between 0.24 and 0.42, all p<0.001) and all-cause mortality (ORs between 0.55 and 0.59, all p<0.05).
non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)	warfarin	major bleedings, intracranial bleedings, and death from any cause	17804	17971	On the safety side, NOACs reduced the risk of major bleedings (by 15%; p<0.001), intracranial bleedings (by 52%; p<0.001) and death from any cause (by 10%; p = 0.001).
non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)	warfarin	the risk of stroke/systemic embolism , stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and systemic embolism	17617	17803	NOACs as a whole reduced the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (by 21%; p<0.001), stroke (by 20%; p<0.001), hemorrhagic stroke (by 50%; p<0.001) and systemic embolism (by 40%; p = 0.006).
non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)	warfarin	major bleedings, intracranial bleedings, and death from any cause	18574	18713	NOACs reduced the risk of major bleedings (by 27%; p<0.001), intracranial bleedings (by 59%; p<0.001) and all-cause death (by 91%; p<0.001)
non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)	warfarin	gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction	18554	18842	On the safety side, NOACs reduced the risk of major bleedings (by 27%; p<0.001), intracranial bleedings (by 59%; p<0.001) and all-cause death (by 91%; p<0.001), whereas gastrointestinal bleedings (p = 0.688) and myocardial infarction (p = 0.640) did not differ between NOACs and warfarin.
edoxaban 30	any other NOAC	The risk of major bleedings	1622	1763	The risk of major bleedings was lower with edoxaban 30 mg than any other NOAC, odds ratios (ORs) ranging between 0.45 and 0.67 (all p<0.001).
