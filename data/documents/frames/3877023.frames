short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) 	1111	1194	The CNR values were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner.
short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	quantitative contour sharpness	913	1110	Regarding all sequences, the relative differences were 39% for the mean overall qualitative image quality, 53% for the mean SNR values, and 34–37% for the quantitative contour sharpness (P<0.0001).
short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) 	22740	22833	The CNR values calculated were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner
short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	quantitative contour sharpness	22845	23197	Regarding quantitative assessment of contour sharpness, the mean values for the two assessed interfaces were significantly smaller in MR images obtained with the short-bore scanner than with the open MR scanner, thus indicating an improved contour sharpness (0.95 [SD, 0.24] versus 1.43 [SD, 0.48] and 0.83 [SD, 0.22] versus 1.32 [SD, 0.51]; P<0.0001).
short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	The mean signal-to-noise (SNR) values	22564	22738	The mean SNR values of all available sequences were significantly higher for short-bore MR images than for open MR images (17.97 [SD, 6.58] versus 11.28 [SD, 4.35]; P<0.0001)
short-bore MR scanner	high-field horizontal open MR scanner	The mean signal-to-noise (SNR) values	22564	22739	The mean SNR values of all available sequences were significantly higher for short-bore MR images than for open MR images (17.97 [SD, 6.58] versus 11.28 [SD, 4.35]; P<0.0001).
high-field horizontal open MR scanner	short-bore MR scanner	Scanning times	1255	1390	Scanning times were significantly longer for examinations performed on the open MR scanner (mean: 32±22 min versus 20±9 min; P<0.0001).
