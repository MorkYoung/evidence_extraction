Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Successful enteral feeding 	1363	1790	The portions of enteral nutrition provided to the target amount and the quantity of gastric discharge were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The Rikkunshito group reached 50% of the target amount of enteral feeding significantly earlier than the metoclopramide group, although the proportion of patients in whom enteral feeding was successful did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Gastric discharge volume 	-1	-1	The volume of gastric discharge. No differences were observed between the two groups during the observation period.
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Successful enteral feeding 	1663	1790	although the proportion of patients in whom enteral feeding was successful did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Active ghrelin levels 	1791	1931	Patients in the Rikkunshito group showed significantly higher plasma levels of active ghrelin compared to those in the metoclopramide group.

Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Gastric discharge volume 	1363	1535	The portions of enteral nutrition provided to the target amount and the quantity of gastric discharge were not statistically significantly different between the two groups.
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Portion of enteral nutrition	-1	-1	The portion of enteral nutrition provided to the patients. No differences were observed between the two groups during the observation period.
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	50% of the target enteral nutrition speed	-1	-1	The Rikkunshito group reached 50% of the target amount of enteral feeding significantly earlier than the metoclopramide group (P = 0.004)
Rikkunshito 	Metoclopramide	Desacyl ghrelin levels 	-1	-1	The changes in the desacyl ghrelin concentrations did not significantly differ between the two groups during the observation period.
