Non-social priming groups	Anti-social priming groups	Nonverbal behaviors	21386	21499	Schizophrenia patients in non-social and anti-social priming conditions were not different (p>.05, see Figure 2).
Pro-social priming group 	Non-social or anti-social priming groups	Nonverbal behaviors	902	1091	Results showed that schizophrenia patients with pro-social priming had significantly more nonverbal behaviors than schizophrenia patients with anti-social and non-social priming conditions.

Non-social priming groups	Anti-social priming groups	Motor-Affective subscale of the MASS dimensions	21501	21823	Results demonstrated that schizophrenia patients primed with non-social words and patients primed with anti-social words were equivalent on all four dimensions of the Motor-Affective subscale of the MASS (spontaneous smiles, spontaneous hand gestures, speech flow and voluntary facial expression, all p>.05, see Figure 3).
Pro-social priming group 	Non-social or anti-social priming groups	Baseline characteristics	20700	20813	The results revealed no difference on the basic demographic and clinical information between schizophrenia groups
