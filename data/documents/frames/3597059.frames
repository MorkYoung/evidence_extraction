Crystalloid (RS group)	Control (C group)	Cardiac output during spinal anesthesia	9470	9719	Intergroup comparison showed that the CO in the HES group was significantly higher than that in the RS and C groups at the corresponding time point during spinal anesthesia, but no significant difference existed between the RS and C groups (Fig. 1).
Crystalloid (RS group) and colloid (HES group)	Control (C group)	Hypotension	1294	1407	Hypotension occurred in 3 patients in the C group and one each in the RS and HES group, respectively (P = 0.362).
Crystalloid (RS group)	Control (C group)	Cardiac output during spinal anesthesia	9470	9709	Intergroup comparison showed that the CO in the HES group was significantly higher than that in the RS and C groups at the corresponding time point during spinal anesthesia, but no significant difference existed between the RS and C groups
Crystalloid (RS group) and colloid (HES group)	Control (C group)	Baseline characteristics	7891	8108	Patient demographic characteristics were similar among the groups (P > 0.05). The main comorbid disease was hypertension in 9 patients in the control group, 6 in the RS group and 8 in the HES group (P > 0.05, Table 1)
Colloid (HES group)	Crystalloid (RS group) and control (C group)	Cardiac output during spinal anesthesia	9470	9709	Intergroup comparison showed that the CO in the HES group was significantly higher than that in the RS and C groups at the corresponding time point during spinal anesthesia, but no significant difference existed between the RS and C groups
Crystalloid (RS group) and colloid (HES group)	Control (C group)	Baseline characteristics	8795	8870	Baseline hemodynamic variables were comparable among the groups (P > 0.05).
Colloid (HES group)	Crystalloid (RS group) and control (C group)	Cardiac output during spinal anesthesia	9470	9643	Intergroup comparison showed that the CO in the HES group was significantly higher than that in the RS and C groups at the corresponding time point during spinal anesthesia,
Crystalloid (RS group) and colloid (HES group)	Control (C group)	Heart rate	10762	10946	In addition, there was a nonsignificant trend toward decrease in the heart rate after spinal anesthesia in all patients, with no significant difference among the three groups (Fig. 3).
Crystalloid (RS group) and colloid (HES group)	Control (C group)	Heart rate	10775	10936	there was a nonsignificant trend toward decrease in the heart rate after spinal anesthesia in all patients, with no significant difference among the three groups
