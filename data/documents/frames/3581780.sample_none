0	9	ondansetron	palonosetron	incidence of vomiting	However, the incidence of vomiting was lower in the palonosetron group than in the ondansetron group (18% vs. 4%, P = 0.025).
1	19	ondansetron	palonosetron	incidence of vomiting	However, the incidence of vomiting was lower in the palonosetron group than in the ondansetron group (18% vs. 4%, P = 0.025).
2	76	ondansetron	palonosetron	total incidence rates of PONV	There was no difference in the total incidence rates of PONV in 0-72 h (52% for the ondansetron group, 48% for the palonosetron group).
3	77	ondansetron	palonosetron	incidence rate for vomiting	The incidence rate for vomiting was significantly lower in the ondansetron group than the palonosetron group (18% vs. 4%, P = 0.025).
4	118	ondansetron	palonosetron	PONV prevention	As a result, palonosetron was far more effective than ondansetron in PONV prevention for 2-24 h (42% vs. 62%).
