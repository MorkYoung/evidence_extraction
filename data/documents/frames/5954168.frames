nonbiopsied patients	biopsied patients	The death rate	16305	16459	The death rate was higher in the nonbiopsied patients; only 20.5% (64/312) of biopsied patients died compared with 32% (172/531) in the nonbiopsied group.
positive biopsy	negative and suspicious biopsies	long-term biochemical progression free survival (bPFS)	-1	-1	Patients with a positive biopsy were more likely to report a bPFS event in the future (HR = 4.81, 95% CI: 2.50–9.26, p < 0.001; Fig. 2A, Table 3).Fig. 2
positive biopsy	negative and suspicious biopsies	long-term biochemical progression free survival (bPFS)	1391	1580	A positive biopsy was prognostic of worse bPFS, going forward, compared with negative and suspicious biopsies, hazard ratio (HR) = 4.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.50–9.26, p < 0.001).
