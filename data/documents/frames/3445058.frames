upright active forward elevation 	the dusting medial exercise	electromyographic (EMG) activity of infraspinatus 	24114	24396	Post hoc analysis for the infraspinatus revealed that upright active forward elevation (21% ± 15% MVIC) generated the most EMG activity but was significantly greater than only the dusting medial exercise (7% ± 5% MVIC), which generated the least EMG activity (P = .00089) (Table 3).
The upright-assisted exercises	the gravity-minimized exercises	electromyographic (EMG) activity of anterior deltoid muscle	1362	1548	The upright-assisted exercises (95% CI, 23% to 42% MVIC) for the anterior deltoid generated more EMG activity than did the gravity-minimized exercises (95% CI, 9% to 21% MVIC) (P < .05).
