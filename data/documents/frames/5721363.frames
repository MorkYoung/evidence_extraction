neuromuscular exercise	traditional quadriceps strengthening exercises	function accounting baseline for severe dysfunction	17238	17554	In the sensitivity analyses accounting for baseline physical function status and an interaction with change in knee flexor strength, there was a significant association between increased knee flexor strength and improved physical function in those with severe physical dysfunction only (Additional file 2: Table S2).
neuromuscular exercise	traditional quadriceps strengthening exercises	function accounting baseline for moderate dysfunction	-1	-1	Notably, the association between change in knee extensor strength and change in physical function was not significant for participants with mild and moderate baseline physical dysfunction (Table 3)
neuromuscular exercise	traditional quadriceps strengthening exercises	function without baseline	-1	-1	Without accounting for baseline physical function status, change in knee extensor muscle strength along with all covariates considered in this study explained 10% of the variation in the change in physical function. A 1-unit increase (Nm/kg) in peak knee extensor strength was associated with a 17-unit improvement (95% CI −29 to −5) in WOMAC physical function

neuromuscular exercise	traditional quadriceps strengthening exercises	function accounting baseline for severe dysfunction	-1	-1	In another model, accounting for baseline physical function status and an interaction with change in knee extensor strength along with all covariates, 33% of the variation in the change in physical function was explained. In this model, a 1-unit increase (Nm/kg) in peak isometric knee extensor strength corresponded to a 24-unit improvement (95% CI −42 to −7) in WOMAC physical function score in participants with severe baseline dysfunction
neuromuscular exercise	traditional quadriceps strengthening exercises	function without baseline	1639	1884	In covariate-adjusted models without accounting for baseline physical function, every 1-unit (Nm/kg) increase in knee extensor strength was associated with physical function improvement of 17 WOMAC units (95% confidence interval (CI) −29 to −5).
