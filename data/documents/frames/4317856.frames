Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Overall response rate	14635	14919	the ORR was 8% for the DZ group (CR, N = 0; PR, N = 4; SD, N = 18; PD, N = 25; not evaluable, N = 1) and 4% for the D group (CR, N = 0; PR, N = 2; SD, N = 20; PD, N = 23; not evaluable, N = 1). The difference in ORR between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.88).
Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Grade 3 or 4 adverse events	1067	1186	There were no clinically relevant differences in the frequencies of grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the two groups.
Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Overall response rate	14829	14919	The difference in ORR between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.88).
Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Median overall survival	885	1066	The median overall survival was 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.0–15.8 months) for the DZ group and 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.1–12.5 months) for the D group (stratified log-rank test, P = 0.62).
Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Median progression-free survival	619	884	In an efficacy analysis of 94 patients (DZ, 48; D, 46), the median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5–3.5 months) for the DZ group and 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.5–3.4 months) for the D group (stratified log-rank test, P = 0.89).
Docetaxel with zoledronic acid (group DZ)	Docetaxel alone (group D)	Median progression-free survival	675	884	the median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5–3.5 months) for the DZ group and 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.5–3.4 months) for the D group (stratified log-rank test, P = 0.89).
