combination of sufentanil 25 mcg and morphine 2 mg (SM)	sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	Duration of analgesia	1338	1455	Duration of analgesia was longer in group M 17.5 ± 1.9 hours and SM 13.8 ± 1.6 hours than in group S 5.2 ± 1.2 hours.
sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	morphine 4 mg (M)	faster onset of pain relief	9958	10202	onset of pain relief [Figure 2] was faster in the sufentanil and sufentanil-morphine groups (7.6 ± 1.5 minutes and 12.2 ± 2.6 minutes respectively), compared to morphine group (67.6 ± 1.5 minutes) which was statistically significant (P< 0.0001)
morphine 4 mg (M)	sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	Duration of analgesia	-1	-1	Duration of Analgesia: Visual Analog Score at 2 hours interval in three groups during 24 hours of the study period. Significant difference (*P < 0.0001) was seen in group S (sufentanil 50 mcg) as compared to groups SM (a combination of sufentanil 25 mcg and morphine 2 mg) and M (morphine 4 mg)
sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	morphine 4 mg (M)	Onset of action	1218	1301	Onset of action were at 7.6 ± 1.5 minutes in group S, 67.6 ± 1.5 minutes in group M
sufentanil-morphine group (SM)	morphine 4 mg (M)	faster onset of pain relief	9954	10202	the onset of pain relief [Figure 2] was faster in the sufentanil and sufentanil-morphine groups (7.6 ± 1.5 minutes and 12.2 ± 2.6 minutes respectively), compared to morphine group (67.6 ± 1.5 minutes) which was statistically significant (P< 0.0001)
morphine 4 mg (M)	sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	Duration of analgesia	1338	1455	Duration of analgesia was longer in group M 17.5 ± 1.9 hours and SM 13.8 ± 1.6 hours than in group S 5.2 ± 1.2 hours.
morphine 4 mg (M)	sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	Duration of analgesia	10666	10848	Analgesia lasted longer in group M and SM, respectively, (17.5 ± 1.9 and 13.8 ± 1.6 hours) than group S (5.2 ± 1.2 hours), which was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) [Table 2].
sufentanil-morphine group (SM)	morphine 4 mg (M)	faster onset of pain relief	9958	10202	onset of pain relief [Figure 2] was faster in the sufentanil and sufentanil-morphine groups (7.6 ± 1.5 minutes and 12.2 ± 2.6 minutes respectively), compared to morphine group (67.6 ± 1.5 minutes) which was statistically significant (P< 0.0001)
sufentanil 50 mcg (S)	morphine 4 mg (M)	faster onset of pain relief	9954	10203	the onset of pain relief [Figure 2] was faster in the sufentanil and sufentanil-morphine groups (7.6 ± 1.5 minutes and 12.2 ± 2.6 minutes respectively), compared to morphine group (67.6 ± 1.5 minutes) which was statistically significant (P< 0.0001).
