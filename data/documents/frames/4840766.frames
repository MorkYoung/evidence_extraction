recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.1	recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels	8855	9015	For the FBG levels, the difference between the initial value and that after 6 months of treatment between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05).
recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.1	recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)	9016	9136	Three months after the treatment, the difference of IGF-1 between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05).
recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	baseline	level of T3	10160	10442	Concerning TSH prior to and after treatment, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05), whereas 6 months after treatment, the difference in the levels of T3 and TSH, as compared with the levels prior to treatment, were statistically significant (P<0.05) (Table III).
recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.1, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	baseline	area under blood glucose curve (AUCglu)	9137	9256	There was no statistically significant difference between AUCglu levels before and after treatment (P>0.05) (Table II).
recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	baseline	level of T3	9752	9926	In the low-dose group, when the level of T3 prior to treatment was compared to T3 3 months following treatment, the difference was clearly statistically significant (P<0.05).
recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.1	recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) 0.05 U/kg 	insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)	8631	8735	The difference of IGF-1, prior to and after 1 month of treatment was statistically significant (P<0.05).
