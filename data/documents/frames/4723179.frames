Sports Vision Training	Control	Near dissociated phoria improvement of right eye	1140	1349	Following the training period, 3 of the 6 oculomotor variables improved. The greatest effect was observed in near dissociated phoria (χ2 =14.56, p=0.001 for the right eye; χ2 =14.757, p=0.001 for the left eye)
Sports Vision Training	Control	Near dissociated phoria improvement of left eye	1213	1349	The greatest effect was observed in near dissociated phoria (χ2 =14.56, p=0.001 for the right eye; χ2 =14.757, p=0.001 for the left eye)
Sports Vision Training	Control	Fusional convergence improvement	14325	14461	there was a statistically significant difference observed in fusional convergence results in the experimental group (χ2=8.522, p=0.014).
Sports Vision Training	Control	Near dissociated phoria improvement of right eye	1213	1349	The greatest effect was observed in near dissociated phoria (χ2 =14.56, p=0.001 for the right eye; χ2 =14.757, p=0.001 for the left eye)
Sports Vision Training	Control	Fusional divergence improvement	14651	14755	To the contrary, no significant difference was found in fusional divergence results (χ2=2.513, p=0.285).
Sports Vision Training	Control	Near dissociated phoria improvement of left eye	986	1396	The phoria screening examination showed that exophoria was the most frequent disorder of binocular vision. Low fusional vergence range was also observed. Following the training period, 3 of the 6 oculomotor variables improved. The greatest effect was observed in near dissociated phoria (χ2 =14.56, p=0.001 for the right eye; χ2 =14.757, p=0.001 for the left eye) and fusional convergence (χ2 =8.522, p=0.014).
