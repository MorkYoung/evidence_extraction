propofol + remifentanil	dexmedetomidine 	decrease in activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I–IV	2661	3169	he activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I–IV in the propofol + remifentanil group at day 1 after operation were significantly decreased compared with those before operation, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The decrease in activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I–IV in the propofol + remifentanil group at day 1 after operation was more significant than that in the dexmedetomidine group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).
propofol + remifentanil	dexmedetomidine 	NIHSS and AVLT scores recovery	14497	14642	The NIHSS and AVLT scores in the two groups recovered at day 15 after operation, and the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05).
propofol + remifentanil	dexmedetomidine 	mitochondrial membrane potentials	2240	2540	At day 1, 3 and 5 after operation, the mitochondrial membrane potentials of the two groups were decreased in different degrees, but the decrease range in the dexmedetomidine group was smaller than that in the propofol + remifentanil group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).
