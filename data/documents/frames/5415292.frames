completers	noncompleters	scores on pre-tests	13996	14090	those who completed had higher scores on pre-tests compared to dropouts at post-test (P = .03)
Non-Hispanics	Hispanics	accessing the program	1334	1475	Non-Hispanics were twice as likely to access the program as Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-3.8, P < .05)
completers	noncompleters	scores on pre-tests	13731	14090	We compared completers and dropouts on baseline sociodemographic characteristics and pre-test scores on knowledge. Using Ï‡2 and 2-sample t tests, significant association for differences by age or gender was determined between completers and noncompleters. However, those who completed had higher scores on pre-tests compared to dropouts at post-test (P = .03)
Non-Hispanics	Hispanics	accessing the program	1332	1476	. Non-Hispanics were twice as likely to access the program as Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-3.8, P < .05).
