Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Heart rate 30 minutes after extubation	12606	12716	The HR was significantly higher in Group B in the immediate post-operative period for first 30 min (P = 0.024)
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Recovery characteristics	14117	14268	We observed from our study that there was no difference between the two groups in the recovery profiles, haemodynamic parameters or surgical conditions
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Heart rate during surgery	1548	1702	The intraoperative heart rate was comparable; however, in the post-operative period, it remained higher in Group B for 30 min after extubation (P = 0.02).
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Heart rate 30 minutes after extubation	1548	1702	The intraoperative heart rate was comparable; however, in the post-operative period, it remained higher in Group B for 30 min after extubation (P = 0.02).
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Brain relaxation scores	1703	1778	The brain relaxation scores were comparable among the two groups (P = 0.27)
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Arterial pressure	1486	1547	The mean arterial pressure was comparable between the groups.
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Heart rate during surgery	12408	12516	There was no significant difference in the HR for most part of the intraoperative and post-operative period.
Neuromuscular blocking agent (Group A)	Atracurium infusion (Group B)	Brain relaxation scores	1703	1779	The brain relaxation scores were comparable among the two groups (P = 0.27).
