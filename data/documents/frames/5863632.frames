Training + coaching 	Control	Suicidal ideas	42459	42616	the control group had significantly higher incidence rates than the training/coaching group (p = 0.017). No other between-group comparisons were significant.
Training only	Control	Suicidal ideas	42459	42616	the control group had significantly higher incidence rates than the training/coaching group (p = 0.017). No other between-group comparisons were significant.
Training + coaching	Training only	Recovery rates	43647	43825	The group main effect reflected significantly greater recovery rates at post-test 2 and follow-up for the training/coaching group compared to the training only group (p = 0.001).
Training only	Control	Recovery rates	43988	44142	the training only group had lower recovery rates than the control group at post-test 2 and follow-up, but once again the differences were not significant.
Training + coaching	Control	Recovery rates	43826	43974	The training/coaching group had higher recovery rates than the control group at post-test 2 and follow-up, but the differences were not significant.
Training only	Control	Recovery rates	43975	44142	In contrast, the training only group had lower recovery rates than the control group at post-test 2 and follow-up, but once again the differences were not significant.
Training + coaching 	Control	Suicidal ideas	1397	1679	teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: a significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up.
