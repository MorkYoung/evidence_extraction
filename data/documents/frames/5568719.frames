Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia	Control	Improvement in Epworth Sleepiness Scale	-1	-1	Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant improvement in ISI (p = 0.007), ESS (p = 0.048) and PIRS20 (p = 0.004) and PHQ-9 (p = 0.011) scores in the treatment group when compared to the respective scores prior to CCBT-I treatment, as shown in Table 4. UPDRS1b scores also significantly improved after treatment, however when modifying the score by removing the sleep variables, the change was no longer significant. However, when comparing the treatment group to the control group, none of these changes were significant, including ISI (−4.5 vs −3.3; p = 0.48)
