1.7 g of Long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils (O3) per day for 4 weeks	safflower oil placebo for 4 weeks	Red cell and plasma phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations	14254	14486	Significant increases are noted for both EPA and DHA and their combination in both samples. In the plasma the combined EPA and DHA increased about 80% and in the red blood cells the combined fatty acids increased about half as much.
1.7 g of Long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils (O3) per day for 4 weeks	safflower oil placebo for 4 weeks	central pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, aortic systolic blood pressure, BMI, waist, total cholesterol, serum glucose, IL-8, and IL-10,CRP 	15175	15558	The effects of supplementation on components of the metabolic syndrome, plasma lipids, vascular measures, and cytokines are shown in Table 3. The daily treatment dose of 1.7 g of O3 for four weeks had no effect on any of these measures compared to the safflower placebo. Not shown are BMI, waist, total cholesterol, serum glucose, IL-8, and IL-10, all of which also showed no effect.
1.7 g of Long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils (O3) per day for 4 weeks	safflower oil placebo for 4 weeks	Red cell and plasma phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations	14027	14167	Figure 1 shows the effect of O3 dosing for four weeks on plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA. Plasma levels increased significantly (p < 0.001).
