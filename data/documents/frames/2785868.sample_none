0	8	placebo	risedronate	hip fracture	After 3 years, hip fracture had occurred in 3.8% of risedronate-treated patients and 7.4% of placebo-treated patients (relative risk 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.91; P = 0.019).
1	16	placebo	risedronate	hip fracture	After 3 years, hip fracture had occurred in 3.8% of risedronate-treated patients and 7.4% of placebo-treated patients (relative risk 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.91; P = 0.019).
2	42	risedronate	placebo	risk of hip fracture	Compared with placebo, risedronate 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg once daily reduced the risk of hip fracture by 46% (relative risk [RR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.32–0.91; P = 0.019) in women aged 70–100 years with established osteoporosis (Table 3).3 This was a numerical larger risk reduction than that found in the overall ITT population from the HIP study (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6–0.9; P = 0.02) (Table 3).
3	46	risedronate	placebo	risk of hip fracture	The HIP study demonstrated that, compared with placebo, risedronate significantly reduced the risk of hip fracture in the overall ITT population by 30% (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6–0.9; P = 0.02).3 In women aged 70–79 years with low BMD, risedronate reduced the risk of hip fracture by 40% (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4–0.9; P = 0.009), and in those with low BMD and a prevalent vertebral fracture by 60% (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–0.8; P = 0.003).
4	49	placebo	risedronate	hip fracture	The present study demonstrates that risedronate is efficacious in older postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, reducing the risk of hip fracture by 46% compared with placebo.
5	52	placebo	zoledronic acid	hip fracture incidence	Over 3-years, hip fracture incidence was reduced from 2.5% in the placebo group to 1.4% with annual infusions of zoledronic acid (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42–0.83; P = 0.002).4  It has also been documented that drug treatment aimed at improving the bone component of fracture risk is effective when patients have well-defined bone-related risk.
