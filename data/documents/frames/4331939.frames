Chukyu (spinehealing)- pharmacopuncture-treated group 	normal saline-pharmacopuncture-treated group	visual analog scale [VAS]	11259	11566	The VAS value for the experimental group went down 3.35 ± 1.99 points from 7.17 ± 1.78 at pre-treatment to 3.83 ± 2.04 posttreatment, and the value for the control group went down 1.82 ± 2.11 points from 7.05 ± 1.86 to 5.23 ± 2.29. This difference showed statistical meaning (t= -2.50, p〈 0.05) (see Table3)
Chukyu (spinehealing)- pharmacopuncture-treated group 	normal saline-pharmacopuncture-treated group	Oswestry low-back pain disability index [ODI].	12175	12474	The ODI values for the experimental group went down 5.09 ± 2.54 from 16.09 ± 5.99 at pre-experiment to 11.00 ± 5.22 at post-experiment, and the values for the control group went down 3.27 ± 3.06 from 18.82 ± 5.15 to 15.55 ± 5.67, a statistically meaningful outcome (t= - 2.17, p〈 0.05) (see Table4).
Chukyu (spinehealing)- pharmacopuncture-treated group 	normal saline-pharmacopuncture-treated group	pain rating scale [PRS]	11720	12025	The PRS value for the experiment group went down 26.70 ± 19.18 from 53.04 ± 20.75 at pre-experiment to 26.35 ± 18.04 at post-experiment, and the value for the control group went down 13.05 ± 17.60 from 56.64 ± 24.27 to 43.59 ± 20.54, a statistically-significant difference (t= -2.49, p〈0.05) (see Table4).
Chukyu (spinehealing)- pharmacopuncture-treated group 	normal saline-pharmacopuncture-treated group	visual analog scale [VAS]	11086	11566	The differences in the VAS values between pre-pharmacopuncture treatment and post-pharmacopuncture treatment were obtained for both the experimental and the control groups. The VAS value for the experimental group went down 3.35 ± 1.99 points from 7.17 ± 1.78 at pre-treatment to 3.83 ± 2.04 posttreatment, and the value for the control group went down 1.82 ± 2.11 points from 7.05 ± 1.86 to 5.23 ± 2.29. This difference showed statistical meaning (t= -2.50, p〈 0.05) (see Table3)
