High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Area under the curve (AUC)	15479	15676	The daily total AUC was significantly higher for the HGI compared to the LGI intervention over the 48 h period (p = 0.03). The daily total AUC also reduced on day 2 of the LGI treatment (p = 0.03).
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Glycemic response after breakfast	1272	1393	Compared to the high GI intervention, the low GI intervention significantly reduced the GR following breakfast (p = 0.02)
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Glycemic response after lunch	1272	1411	Compared to the high GI intervention, the low GI intervention significantly reduced the GR following breakfast (p = 0.02), lunch (p = 0.02)
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Glycemic response after breakfast	1272	1434	Compared to the high GI intervention, the low GI intervention significantly reduced the GR following breakfast (p = 0.02), lunch (p = 0.02) and dinner (p = 0.05).
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion	-1	-1	MAGE: Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursion.
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion	15781	15901	However, the HGI treatment produced a significantly greater MAGE than the LGI treatment over the 48 h period (p = 0.03).
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Glycemic response after lunch	1272	1434	Compared to the high GI intervention, the low GI intervention significantly reduced the GR following breakfast (p = 0.02), lunch (p = 0.02) and dinner (p = 0.05).
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Glycemic response after dinner	1272	1434	Compared to the high GI intervention, the low GI intervention significantly reduced the GR following breakfast (p = 0.02), lunch (p = 0.02) and dinner (p = 0.05).
High glycemic index intervention	Low glycemic index intervention	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion	1753	1832	The MAGE was significantly lower during the entire low GI treatment (p = 0.03).
