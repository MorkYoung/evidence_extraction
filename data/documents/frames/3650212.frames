using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	The tipping	12505	12624	The tipping was only significant in group 1, and it was significantly larger in this group than in group 2 (p < 0.001).
using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	Treatment time	13172	13298	Treatment time was significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2 (7.44 ± 1.30 months versus 6.27 ± 1.11 months; p < 0.001).
using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	Mesial movement of the second premolars	12626	12878	Mesial movement of the second premolars was 2.70 ± 1.37 mm and 0.90 ± 1.38 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Although the change was significant in each of the 2 groups, mesial movement was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p = 0.008).
using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	The speed of maxillary molar distalization	13299	13460	The speed of maxillary molar distalization was also significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (0.68 ± 0.40 mm/month versus 0.86 ± 0.32 mm/month; p < 0.001).
using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	the ratio of the maxillary molar distalization movement relative to the overall opening space between the molars and second premolars	13461	13705	Finally, the ratio of the maxillary molar distalization movement relative to the overall opening space between the molars and second premolars was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (70.74% ± 7.25% versus 90.97% ± 5.51%; p < 0.001).
using the FA alone	a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night	The maxillary molars movement	12128	12375	The maxillary molars moved distally by 5.51 ± 2.56 mm and 5.93 ± 1.46 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The change was significant in each of the 2 groups (pre-versus post-treatment), but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.
