Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine	Group C receiving identical-looking placebo	number of patients and dosage of esmolol	1158	1318	Significantly, less number of patients and less dosage of esmolol were required (P = 0.0040 and 0.0001, respectively) in Group F as compared to that in Group C.
Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine	Group C receiving identical-looking placebo	number of patients and dosage of esmolol	15445	15606	Again to ensure induced hypotension, dose of esmolol and the number of patients treated with it were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in Group C than F [Table 1].
Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine	Group C receiving identical-looking placebo	MAP and HR	15848	15958	MAP and HR between two groups were found to be quite comparable among two groups (P > 0.05) [Figures 1 and 2].
Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine	Group C receiving identical-looking placebo	Side effects 	1713	1819	Discharge time from PACU and hospital was similar between two groups without any appreciable side effects.
Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine	Group C receiving identical-looking placebo	Side effects 	15774	15847	Side effects were all comparable between two groups (P > 0.05) [Table 6].
