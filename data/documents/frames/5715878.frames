Recombinant‐human chorionic gonadotropin	Urine‐derived human chorionic gonadotropin	Ovulation induction (mid‐luteal progesterone level ≥5 ng/mL)	15816	16226	For the primary efficacy evaluation, ovulation, defined as a mid‐luteal progesterone level ≥5 ng/mL, was reported in all the participants in the modified ITT population (Table 2) and the lower limit of the two‐sided 95% CI of the difference between ovulation rates was −7.8%, which was above the non‐inferiority margin of −20%. Therefore, treatment with r‐hCG was non‐inferior to u‐hCG for ovulation induction.
