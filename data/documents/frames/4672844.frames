Resilon + Epiphany	Control	Fracture resistance	11520	11670	The ANOVA showed a highly significant difference with respect to mean fracture resistance between the three groups (P < 0.0001) (Table 2 and Graph 2).
Gutta-percha	Control	Fracture resistance	11520	11670	The ANOVA showed a highly significant difference with respect to mean fracture resistance between the three groups (P < 0.0001) (Table 2 and Graph 2).
Resilon + Epiphany	Gutta-percha	Fracture resistance	11352	11647	Thus, group obturated with Resilon/Epiphany sealer offered more resistance to fracture (309.16 N) than those obturated with AH Plus sealer and Gutta-percha (248.36 N). The ANOVA showed a highly significant difference with respect to mean fracture resistance between the three groups (P < 0.0001)
