at least 70 measured subjects (35 per group)	Less Than 70 measured subjects (35 per group) 	Sample size requirements to estimate SDp from external pilot randomised controlled trials	1769	1905	recommend that an external pilot study has at least 70 measured subjects (35 per group) when estimating the SDp for a continuous outcome
60 to 100 subjects in a single group	Less than 60 subjects in a single group	event rate estimation	28873	29209	Most of the fluctuation is due to deriving estimates from a sample size where the true proportion is not a possible outcome (e.g., if the true proportion is 0.5 but the sample size is 25, then the closest you can observe to the true value is 12/25 or 13/25). Once the pilot sample size is 60 or more then these fluctuations settle down.
at least 70 measured subjects (35 per group)	Less Than 70 measured subjects (35 per group) 	Sample size requirements to estimate SDp from external pilot randomised controlled trials	24069	24329	With a total sample size of 70, there is a less than 10% gain in precision when adding further participants to the study size. So in terms of good precision and minimal bias (for a continuous outcome) a total sample size of 70 seems desirable for a pilot study
a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group)	Less than 120 subjects 	Binary primary outcome	1907	2159	If the event rate in an intervention group needs to be estimated by the pilot then a total of 60 to 100 subjects is required. Hence if the primary outcome is binary a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group) may be required in the pilot trial.
use a larger pilot study	inflated estimates	Efficiency	2160	2292	It is very much more efficient to use a larger pilot study, than to guard against the lack of precision by using inflated estimates.
a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group)	Less than 120 subjects 	Binary primary outcome	2033	2159	Hence if the primary outcome is binary a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group) may be required in the pilot trial.
60 to 100 subjects in a single group	Less than 60 subjects in a single group	event rate estimation	30817	30899	60 to 100 subjects in a single group for estimating an event rate seems reasonable
60 to 100 subjects in a single group	Less than 60 subjects in a single group	event rate estimation	30679	30900	a total of at least 70 may be necessary for estimating the standard deviation of a normally distributed variable with good precision, and 60 to 100 subjects in a single group for estimating an event rate seems reasonable.
60 to 100 subjects in a single group	Less than 60 subjects in a single group	event rate estimation	29745	29912	The relative percentage gain in the precision graph crosses the 5% threshold when the sample size is 55 to 60 and crosses the 3% threshold when the sample size is 100.
