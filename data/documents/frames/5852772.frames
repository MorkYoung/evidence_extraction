CCC group - oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day)	CCP group - received a placebo	Serum Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH) average target level (≤300 pg/mL) at 24 weeks - severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients	13214	13323	At 24 weeks, an average target iPTH level (≤300 pg/mL) was achieved in the CCC group but not in the CCP group
CCC group - oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day)	CCP group - received a placebo	Serum (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) 25(OH)D3 levels at 16 weeks - severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients	15412	15779	A significant number of patients in the CCC group achieved target 25(OH)D3 level (≥30 ng/dL) as early as the 12th week compared to the CCP group (21/27 (78%) vs. 2/28 (7%), p = 0.001 at 12th week); and nearly 89% of the CCC group vs only 10.7% in the CCP group achieved the target level at the end of the study (24/27 vs. 3/28, p = 0.001 (chi-square test)) (Table 6).
CCC group - oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day)	CCP group - received a placebo	Serum (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) 25(OH)D3 levels at 16 weeks - severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients	13583	13791	The median changes in iPTH levels from baseline were significantly different as early as the 16th week of the study, −528.5 ± 148.1 pg/mL in the CCC group vs. −451.6 ± 116.0 pg/mL in the CCP group (p = 0.036)
CCC group - oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day)	CCP group - received a placebo	Serum (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) 25(OH)D3 levels at end of study - severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients	15162	15284	In the CCC group, 25(OH)D3 levels increased significantly from 18.2 ± 8.4 to 37.4 ± 9.6 (p < 0.01) at the end of the study
CCC group - oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day)	CCP group - received a placebo	Serum (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) 25(OH)D3 levels at end of study - severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients	15162	15779	In the CCC group, 25(OH)D3 levels increased significantly from 18.2 ± 8.4 to 37.4 ± 9.6 (p < 0.01) at the end of the study. However, in the CCP group, 25(OH)D3 levels did not change significantly (from 19.2 ± 7.4 to 23.4 ± 7.5 (p = 0.46)) (Table 2). A significant number of patients in the CCC group achieved target 25(OH)D3 level (≥30 ng/dL) as early as the 12th week compared to the CCP group (21/27 (78%) vs. 2/28 (7%), p = 0.001 at 12th week); and nearly 89% of the CCC group vs only 10.7% in the CCP group achieved the target level at the end of the study (24/27 vs. 3/28, p = 0.001 (chi-square test)) (Table 6).

The serum iPTH levels were significantly lower in the CCC group compared to the CCP group from the 20th week of the study, 336.4 ± 124.1 pg/mL in the CCC group vs. 404.4 ± 107.0 pg/mL in the CCP group (p = 0.034) at 20th week (Table 3 & Figure 2).
