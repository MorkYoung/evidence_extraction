bosentan	no treatment	overall survival of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)	-1	-1	Significant differences were noted for the bosentan-treated (n�??=�??12) vs. untreated (n�??=�??12) groups in hospital-free survival (603.44�??±�??50.074 days vs. 358.87�??±�??68.65 days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; P�??=�??0.017) and overall survival (671 days vs. 433.78�??±�??66.98 days; HR, 0.10; P�??=�??0.0082).
bosentan	no treatment	hospital-free survival of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)	23062	23477	At the time of survival time analysis, hospital-free survival was 358.87 ± 68.65 days (mean ± SE) (median, 331 days) in the untreated group, which was significantly different from that in the drug-treated group (603.44 ± 50.074 days) as assessed by proportional hazard analysis (hazard ratio of the drug-treated group to the untreated group, 0.19, P = 0.017; log-rank test, P = 0.019; and Wilcoxon test, P = 0.014).
