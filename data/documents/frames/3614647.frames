Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) treatment	Placebo	severity of individual menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweating in particular)	1678	2131	Maca-GO significantly reduced both frequency and severity of individual menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweating in particular) resulting in significant (P<0.001) alleviation of KMI (from 22 to 10), thus, offering an attractive non-hormonal addition to the choices available to early-postmenopausal women in the form of a natural plant alternative to Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) â€“ hence, reducing dependence on hormone therapy programs.
Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) treatment	Placebo	High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) level 	1537	1677	Maca-GO significantly stimulated production of E2 (P<0.001) with a simultaneous suppression (P<0.05) of blood FSH, increase (P<0.05) in HDL.
Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) treatment	Placebo	Progesterone (PRG) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels in group APMM	21097	21438	Results from hormone assays (Table 1) showed that, in comparison to placebo, out of four hormones studied, a significant (P<0.05) decrease in FSH and a highly significant (P<0.001) increase in E2 were observed in sequence group APMM only, without significant changes (P>0.05) recorded in PRG and LH levels within the same sequence treatment.

Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) treatment	Placebo	estradiol (E2) level in group APMM	1537	1677	Maca-GO significantly stimulated production of E2 (P<0.001) with a simultaneous suppression (P<0.05) of blood FSH, increase (P<0.05) in HDL.
Pre-Gelatinized Organic Maca (Maca-GO) treatment	Placebo	High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) level 	1495	1677	A total of 124 women concluded the study. Maca-GO significantly stimulated production of E2 (P<0.001) with a simultaneous suppression (P<0.05) of blood FSH, increase (P<0.05) in HDL.
