whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC)	whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC)	tympanic temperature from Pre to P20 (-0.28 ±0.11°C)	1266	1439	The WBC sessions caused an almost certain decrease in tympanic temperature from Pre to P20 (-0.28 ±0.11°C), while it only decreased at P20 (-0.14±0.05°C) after PBC sessions.
whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC)	whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC)	effects of cryostimulation on the ANS	2131	2321	The main result of this study indicates that the head exposure to cold during whole-body cryostimulation may not be the main factor responsible for the effects of cryostimulation on the ANS.
whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC)	whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC)	systolic BP	25284	25405	No marked changes in systolic and diastolic BP were recorded after the cryostimulation sessions in PBC and WBC modalities

whole-body to cold (whole-body cryostimulation, WBC)	whole-body except the head (partial-body cryostimulation, PBC)	diastolic BP	25284	25632	No marked changes in systolic and diastolic BP were recorded after the cryostimulation sessions in PBC and WBC modalities. Only a likely small decrease in systolic BP was recorded after the third PBC session and a likely small increase in diastolic BP after the two first WBC sessions, but these increases disappeared for the next sessions (Fig 4).
