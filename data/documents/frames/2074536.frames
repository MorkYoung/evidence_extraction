Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy 	Conventional radiotherapy	Survival rate after 2 years in non-small cell lung cancer patients	544	741	The trial in non-small-cell lung cancer included 563 patients and showed improvement in survival; 30% of the CHART patients were alive at 2 years compared with 20% in the control group (P = 0.006).
Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy 	Conventional radiotherapy	Long-term morbidity	1039	1207	The early mucosal reactions appeared sooner and were more troublesome with CHART, however they quickly settled; so far no difference in long-term morbidity has emerged.
