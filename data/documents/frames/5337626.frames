7·5 mg/kg intravenous bevacizumab on day 1 of every cycle of chemotherapy and for six further doses once every 21 days following chemotherapy and three pre-operative and three post-operative cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine chemotherapy: 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 and 1250 mg/m2 oral capecitabine on days 1–21.	control group (chemotherapy alone) received three pre-operative and three post-operative cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine chemotherapy: 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 and 1250 mg/m2 oral capecitabine on days 1–21.	evidence of a treatment effect	29259	29451	There was no evidence of a treatment effect of bevacizumab on either disease-free survival (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·89–1·22; p=0·62) or progression-free survival (HR 1·05, 95% CI 0·89–1·23; p=0·56).
