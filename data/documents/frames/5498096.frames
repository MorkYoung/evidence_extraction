stabilization in prone (SIP)	stabilization in supine (SIS) or prone and supine (SIPS) position group	pain intensity and functional disability	1242	1416	However, the result showed that there was no significant difference in the PI and FD at the 8th week (P>0.05) of the treatment sessions across the three groups when compared.
stabilization exercise in prone position group (SIP)	baseline	pain intensity and disability index	15188	15345	The result revealed that there was a significant reduction between pretreatment, 4th week of PI (F=22.500, P<0.001) and DI (F= 15.582, P<0.001) and 8th week.
stabilization in supine position group (SIS)	baseline	pain intensity and disability index	15470	15728	Presented in Table 3 is the result of comparison of outcome measures of SIS position group. The result revealed that there was a significant reduction when pretreatment, 4th week of PI (F= 13.314, P<0.001) and DI (F=15.95 P<0.001) and 8th week were compared.
stabilization in prone (SIP)	stabilization in supine (SIS) or prone and supine (SIPS) position group	pain intensity and functional disability	16224	16426	There was no significant difference when the pretreatment (F=0.57, P>0.05), 4th week (F=0.779, P>0.468) and 8 week (F=0.000, P>1.000) pain intensity and disability index were compared across the groups.
stabilization in supine position group (SIS)	baseline	pain intensity and disability index	1079	1241	Within-group comparison indicated that PI and FD at the 4th and 8th week were significantly reduced (P<0.001) when compared with baseline in all the three groups.
stabilization in prone and supine group (SIPS)	baseline	pain intensity and disability index	15990	16146	The result revealed that there was a significant reduction between pretreatment and 4th week PI (F=17.894, P< 0.001) and DI (F=17.200 P<0.000) and 8th week.
stabilization in supine position group (SIS)	baseline	pain intensity and disability index	15562	15728	The result revealed that there was a significant reduction when pretreatment, 4th week of PI (F= 13.314, P<0.001) and DI (F=15.95 P<0.001) and 8th week were compared.
