F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	decrease in systolic blood pressure	609	775	There was no statistically significant difference in any parameter in the two groups except for a significant fall in systolic and mean arterial pressure in F2 group.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	bradycardia	7253	7442	The heart rate did not show any significant changes in either group though the incidence of bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats per minute) was higher (16%) in group F2 compared to group F1.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	stable hemodynamic profile	888	958	Fentanyl in the lower dose provides a more stable hemodynamic profile.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	heart rate	7253	7442	The heart rate did not show any significant changes in either group though the incidence of bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats per minute) was higher (16%) in group F2 compared to group F1.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	Incidence of sore throat	7508	7614	Incidence of sore throat was comparable immediately after recovery and 24 h after recovery in both groups.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	stable hemodynamic profile	7967	8127	The patients who received fentanyl 1 mcg/kg remained more hemodynamically stable compared to those receiving fentanyl 2 mcg/kg in our cancer patient population.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	Incidence of sore throat	7616	7804	The overall conditions for LMA insertion, mean time taken, total number of attempts taken for insertion, fiberoptic view, and incidence of sore throat were comparable in both study groups.
F1 (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg)	F2 (fentanyl 2 mcg/kg)	heart rate	7253	7320	The heart rate did not show any significant changes in either group
