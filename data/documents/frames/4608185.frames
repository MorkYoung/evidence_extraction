Chi running program	Control	Diastolic blood pressure 	1254	1380	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.
Chi running program	Standard running program	Body mass index	22435	22599	While there is no statistical between-group difference in the slope of change over time, only the slope in the ChiRunning group is significantly different from zero
Chi running program	Standard running program	Systolic blood pressure 	1254	1380	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.
Chi running program	Control	Systolic blood pressure 	1254	1380	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.
Chi running program	Standard running program	Injury incidence 	23338	23415	Injury incidence per 100 h of running was also similar between the two groups
Chi running program	Standard running program	Injury incidence 	1626	1837	Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p = 0.72)
Chi running program	Standard running program	Diastolic blood pressure 	1254	1380	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups.
Chi running program	Standard running program	Body mass index	1381	1625	Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p = 0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [−0.1 to −0.002] vs. control −0.01 [−0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p = 0.22).
