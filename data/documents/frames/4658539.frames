Placebo analgesic + Haloperidol	Control	TH-like immunoreactive cells	20741	20888	There were significantly fewer TH-like immunoreactive cells in the P + H group than in the Control (p < 0.05) and other Placebo groups (p < 0.001),
Placebo analgesic + Haloperidol	Placebo analgesic + Naloxone	TH-like immunoreactive cells	20741	20888	There were significantly fewer TH-like immunoreactive cells in the P + H group than in the Control (p < 0.05) and other Placebo groups (p < 0.001),
Placebo analgesic alone	Control	TH-like immunoreactive cells	20581	20740	We observed significantly more TH-like immunoreactive cells in the VTA region of the Placebo (p < 0.001) and P + N groups (p < 0.01) than in the Control group.
Placebo analgesic + Haloperidol	Placebo analgesic alone	TH-like immunoreactive cells	20234	20977	The number of TH-like immunoreactive cells in the VTA was 43.8 ± 3.4 in the Control group, 72.4 ± 5.1 in the Placebo group, 64.0 ± 4.2 in the P + N group, and 28.0 ± 1.7 in the P + H group. The number of TH-like immunoreactive cells significantly differed among the groups (ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests, F(3, 12) = 36.152, p < 0.001). We observed significantly more TH-like immunoreactive cells in the VTA region of the Placebo (p < 0.001) and P + N groups (p < 0.01) than in the Control group. There were significantly fewer TH-like immunoreactive cells in the P + H group than in the Control (p < 0.05) and other Placebo groups (p < 0.001), which demonstrated the successful blockage of TH expression in the VTA region (Fig. 4A).
Placebo analgesic alone	Control	Fos-like immunoreactive cells 	21381	21519	There were significantly fewer Fos-like immunoreactive cells in the ACC region of the Placebo group than in the Control group (p < 0.001).
