Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Oxidative stress index	1357	1445	upplemented cows showed a lower risk for OS, as reflected by a lower OS index (P = .036)
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Insulin minimum concentration	16862	16968	the insulin AUC, insulin minimum concentration, and insulin half窶人ife were decreased in supplemented cows.
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Insulin half life	16862	16968	the insulin AUC, insulin minimum concentration, and insulin half窶人ife were decreased in supplemented cows.
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Oxidative stress index	1356	1446	Supplemented cows showed a lower risk for OS, as reflected by a lower OS index (P = .036),
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Non-esterified fatty acids AUC	17394	17496	Supplemented cows had larger NEFA AUC, a faster NEFA elimination rate, and a decreased NEFA half窶人ife.
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Glucose maximum concentration	16677	16803	There was no difference between groups in maximum concentration during IVGTT (Fig 1A, P = .64) or Tbasal (P = .77) for glucose
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Insulin half life	16914	16968	insulin half窶人ife were decreased in supplemented cows.
Antioxidant supplementation	Control	Insulin secretion 	16969	17087	Insulin secretion in response to glucose infusion (peak concentration) was not affected by treatment (Fig 1B, P = .29)
