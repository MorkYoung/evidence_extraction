ASV group	Control group	Dose-dependency for the effect of ASV on cardiovascular risk	19228	19350	No dose-dependency for the effect of ASV on cardiovascular risk was observed in either the adjusted or unadjusted analyses
ASV group	Control group	Risk of cardiovascular death	1343	1743	On-treatment analysis showed similar results to the SERVE-HF intention-to-treat analysis, with an increased risk of cardiovascular death in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients with predominant central sleep apnoea treated with adaptive servo ventilation. Bias is inevitable and needs to be taken into account in any kind of on-treatment analysis in positive airway pressure studies.
