Nanoparticles	Placebo	Adverse events	15082	15248	Interim analysis, as assessed by the DSMB, after completion of each dose-group showed no significant adverse events, symptoms, or doubling of white blood cell counts.
Nanoparticles	Placebo	Coagulation parameters	-1	-1	Comparison of coagulation parameters after bronchial segmental challenge with saline (placebo) or 100 Î1⁄4g nanoparticles showed no significant differences between those groups
Nanoparticles	Placebo	Neutrophils in blood	-1	-1	There was a significant dose-dependent increase in blood neutrophils (p = 0.046) after challenge with carbon nanoparticles. The individual top-dose of 100 Î1⁄4g showed a significant (p = 0.05) increase in terms of percentage neutrophils in blood as compared to placebo.
Nanoparticles	Placebo	Neutrophils in blood	1096	1362	There was a significant dose-dependent increase in blood neutrophils (p = 0.046) after challenge with carbon nanoparticles. The individual top-dose of 100 μg showed a significant (p = 0.05) increase in terms of percentage neutrophils in blood as compared to placebo.
Nanoparticles	Placebo	Coagulation parameters	-1	-1	Comparison of coagulation parameters after bronchial segmental challenge with saline (placebo) or 100 μg nanoparticles showed no significant differences between those groups.
Nanoparticles	Placebo	Leukocytes in blood	-1	-1	a trend towards increased blood leukocytes (p = 0.061) after challenge with carbon nanoparticles as compared to placebo
