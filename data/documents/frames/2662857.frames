40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	mean physician Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale - eye contact	987	1470	After 40 sessions, mean physician CGI scores significantly improved in the treatment group compared to controls in overall functioning (p = 0.0008), receptive language (p < 0.0001), social interaction (p = 0.0473), and eye contact (p = 0.0102); 9/30 children (30%) in the treatment group were rated as "very much improved" or "much improved" compared to 2/26 (8%) of controls (p = 0.0471); 24/30 (80%) in the treatment group improved compared to 10/26 (38%) of controls (p = 0.0024).
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	Mean parental CGI scores - overall functioning 	1471	1662	Mean parental CGI scores significantly improved in the treatment group compared to controls in overall functioning (p = 0.0336), receptive language (p = 0.0168), and eye contact (p = 0.0322).
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	mean physician Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale - eye contact	-1	-1	Examination of the physician CGI subscales demonstrated that more children improved in the treatment group compared to the control group in receptive language (p < 0.0001), social interaction (p = 0.0473), and eye contact (p = 0.0102); a trend towards improvement was also observed in activity level (p = 0.0545).Figure 2
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	Mean parental CGI scores - eye contact	29048	29248	Examination of the parental CGI subscales demonstrated that more children improved in the treatment group compared to the control group in receptive language (p = 0.0168) and eye contact (p = 0.0322).
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	Mean parental CGI scores - eye contact	21338	21710	A total score for change in overall functioning was rated by a parent or primary caregiver and separately by the treating physician (the same physician who initially evaluated the child) using the following ratings: 1 ("very much improved"), 2 ("much improved"), 3 ("minimally improved"), 4 ("no change"), 5 ("minimally worse"), 6 ("much worse"), and 7 ("very much worse")
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	Mean parental CGI scores - receptive language	21227	21711	The CGI scale gives an impression of global changes in certain areas for each child compared to baseline [41]. A total score for change in overall functioning was rated by a parent or primary caregiver and separately by the treating physician (the same physician who initially evaluated the child) using the following ratings: 1 ("very much improved"), 2 ("much improved"), 3 ("minimally improved"), 4 ("no change"), 5 ("minimally worse"), 6 ("much worse"), and 7 ("very much worse").
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	sensory/cognitive awareness	2048	2178	On the ATEC, sensory/cognitive awareness significantly improved (p = 0.0367) in the treatment group compared to the control group.
40 hourly treatments of either hyperbaric treatment	control group	Mean parental CGI scores - receptive language	1471	1662	Mean parental CGI scores significantly improved in the treatment group compared to controls in overall functioning (p = 0.0336), receptive language (p = 0.0168), and eye contact (p = 0.0322).
