0	8	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	bronchodilation	All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).
1	8	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	mean trough FEV1	All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).
2	24	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	bronchodilation	All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).
3	24	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	mean trough FEV1	All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID).
4	120	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	mean trough FEV1	Furthermore, all glycopyrronium bromide treatment groups had statistically significant absolute increases in mean trough FEV1 compared with placebo.
5	121	glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	FEV1	Increases in FEV1 over that seen with placebo ranged from 51 mL (with glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD) to 160 mL (with glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID), equating to 27-85% of the model-predicted maximum effect of any glycopyrronium bromide dose (Table 2).
6	178	Glycopyrronium bromide	placebo	FEV1	Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD has been shown to effectively improve COPD symptoms and reduce exacerbations: in the Phase III GLOW1 study this treatment regimen produced a 108 mL difference in trough FEV1 (at 12 weeks) compared with placebo (p < 0.001), which is comparable to the difference reported in the present study (109 mL versus placebo).
7	181	placebo -	glycopyrronium bromide	AEs	The incidence of AEs was similar in glycopyrronium bromide - and placebo-treated patients.
