cassia fistula emulsion (CFE) 	mineral oil (MO)	Drug's compliances	1914	1984	Drug's compliances were not significantly different in the two groups.
cassia fistula emulsion (CFE) 	mineral oil (MO)	The frequency of defecation	1337	1529	The frequency of defecation in CFE group improved from 1.7 per week (before the study) to 10.6 per week (at the third week) while this parameter differed in MO group from 2 to 6.1 (p < 0.001).
cassia fistula emulsion (CFE) 	mineral oil (MO)	improvement rate	20260	20515	After a 3-week follow-up, the improvement rate was significantly better in CFE group, so that 84% in this group exited from the criteria of functional constipation, but improvement in MO group after 3 weeks was 50% (p = 0.002). The details are in Table 3.
cassia fistula emulsion (CFE) 	mineral oil (MO)	fecal incontinence and retentive posturing	1530	1779	The severity of pain during defecation and consistency of stool improved significantly better in CFE group than MO group (p < 0.05), but there were not any significant differences between the two groups in fecal incontinence and retentive posturing.

cassia fistula emulsion (CFE) 	mineral oil (MO)	improvement rate	18567	18698	In qualitative comparison between the two groups, improvement (exit from the criteria of FC) was significantly better in CFE group.
