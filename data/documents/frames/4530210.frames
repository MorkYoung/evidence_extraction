Extracorporeal shockwave therapy	Placebo	Cutaneous capillary blood flow	10496	10871	after the second application of ESWT cutaneous capillary blood flow increased significantly (126.6 ± 60.5 AU; P > 0.05 versus baseline) and remained significantly elevated for 20 minutes with a second peak after the third application of ESWT (121.8 ± 54.5 AU; P > 0.05 versus baseline). In contrast, cutaneous capillary blood velocity in the placebo group remained unchanged.
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy	Placebo	Cutaneous capillary blood flow	1132	1296	Cutaneous capillary blood flow showed a significant increase after the second application which was sustained for 20 minutes after the third application (P < 0.05).
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy	Placebo	Postcapillary Venous Filling Pressure	9756	10150	Postcapillary venous filling pressure in the experimental group increased 1 minute after each application of ESWT (first application: 36.6 ± 9.4; second application: 37.4 ± 11.3; third application: 36.5 ± 11.5), statistically insignificant, respectively, decreasing to baseline 20 minutes after application (27.7 ± 8.8). The placebo group showed no significant changes from the baseline either.
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy	Placebo	Cutaneous tissue oxygen saturation	859	1062	In experimental group, cutaneous tissue oxygen saturation was increased 1 minute after the first application and until the end of the measuring period at 80 minutes after the second treatment (P < 0.05).
