Transcranial alternating current stimulation	Control	Task performance	21925	22100	Performance within the two groups was similar before and after stimulation. Thus, tACS did not alter task performance differently between groups beyond the stimulation period.
Transcranial alternating current stimulation	Control	Task performance	21925	22000	Performance within the two groups was similar before and after stimulation.
Transcranial alternating current stimulation	Control	3-Back Task	22676	22960	Hence, no effect of tACS could be found when analyzing the 3-back performance. A significant change of performance from before to after stimulation (main effect of measurement: F(1,31) = 9.835, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.241) could be demonstrated, however, which did not differ between groups
Transcranial alternating current stimulation	Control	3-Back Task	22579	22752	Neither the main effect of group nor the interaction of group with measurement were significant. Hence, no effect of tACS could be found when analyzing the 3-back performanc
Transcranial alternating current stimulation	Control	EEG amplitudes	24107	24445	This analysis revealed that amplitudes increased differently over frequencies (main effect of frequency: F(1,6) = 2.312, p = 0.035, η2 = 0.069) and that this effect is modulated by tACS (interaction of frequency and group: F(1,6) = 2.404, p = 0.029, η2 = 0.072). Thus, amplitude increases were shown to be different between the two groups
