Ketamine + Risperidone	Placebo	Smooth pursuit eye movements velocity gain	18781	19235	Both SPEM velocity gain and saccadic frequency showed an effect of velocity with worse performance at faster velocities. In addition, the ketamine-treated groups showed worse performance on both SPEM velocity gain and saccadic frequency compared with placebo. A velocity by ketamine interaction was also observed for both SPEM measures, indicating a smaller difference between ketamine and placebo in saccadic gain and frequency for the fastest velocity.
Risperidone + saline	Ketamine 	Saccadic amplitude gain	18067	18230	Reduced amplitude gain was observed for risperidone-treated groups compared with the other groups. No other significant main effects or interactions were observed.
Ketamine 	Placebo	Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale scores	20063	20233	CADSS total scores and the subscales of amnesia, and derealisation were significantly higher in the ketamine-treated groups compared with the placebo groups (all P<0.01).
Ketamine 	Placebo	Smooth pursuit saccadic frequency	842	985	Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P<0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all Pâ©¾0.07).
Risperidone + saline	Placebo	Saccadic amplitude gain	18067	18230	Reduced amplitude gain was observed for risperidone-treated groups compared with the other groups. No other significant main effects or interactions were observed.
Risperidone + saline	Placebo	Saccadic amplitude gain	18067	18165	Reduced amplitude gain was observed for risperidone-treated groups compared with the other groups.
