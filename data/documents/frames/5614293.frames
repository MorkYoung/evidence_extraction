combination of IVT and IVB	intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVT) or intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB)	The mean score of final visual acuity	9857	10082	The mean score of final visual acuity was 0.293±0.11 in the IVT group, 0.25±0.10 in the IVB group and 0.48±0.15 in the IVB+IVT group. The differences between groups, considering final visual acuity, was significant (p<0.001).
combination of IVT and IVB	intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVT) or intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB)	The average of final visual acuity	10790	11064	The average of final visual acuity was obtained as following, in the IVT group, 0.293±0.11, in the IVB group, 0.25±0.1 and in the IVT + IVB group, 0.48±0.15. The difference between the groups was statistically significant in terms of final visual acuity (p<0.001) (Table 2).
