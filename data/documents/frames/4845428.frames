MRI + (PM or DTI)	MRI + NE	levels of decompression 	23734	23934	The levels of decompression determined by MRI + (PM or DTI) in the experimental group were statistically significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group (p = 0.000) (Table 7).
experimental group	control group	surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion	-1	-1	The surgical time, blood loss, and surgical transfusion were statistically significantly less in the experimental group (p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.001, respectively). There were no differences in leg dysesthesia complications (p = 0.109) (Table 7).
