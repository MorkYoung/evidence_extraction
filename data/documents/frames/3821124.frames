Clonidine	Placebo	Recovery time on opium addicted patients 	10020	10214	Recovery time in clonidine groups of both patients with and without opium addiction was less than placebo ones which showed statistically significant difference (both P < 0.01, based on t-test).
Clonidine	Placebo	Shivering 	1430	1674	None of the patients with and without addiction in clonidine groups had shivering after the operation but in placebo groups shivering was observed and the difference between clonidine and placebo groups was statistically significant (P < 0.01).
Clonidine	Placebo	Recovery time on opium non-addicted patients 	1675	1790	Recovery time in clonidine groups of patients with and without addiction was less than placebo ones (both P < 0.01)
Clonidine	Placebo	Shivering 	1430	1673	None of the patients with and without addiction in clonidine groups had shivering after the operation but in placebo groups shivering was observed and the difference between clonidine and placebo groups was statistically significant (P < 0.01)
Clonidine	Placebo	Recovery time on opium addicted patients 	10020	10384	Recovery time in clonidine groups of both patients with and without opium addiction was less than placebo ones which showed statistically significant difference (both P < 0.01, based on t-test). However the magnitude of the difference was higher in opium addicted than non-addicted patients (P = 0.04, based on interaction analysis in two way analysis of variance)
Clonidine	Placebo	Recovery time on opium non-addicted patients 	10020	10214	Recovery time in clonidine groups of both patients with and without opium addiction was less than placebo ones which showed statistically significant difference (both P < 0.01, based on t-test).
