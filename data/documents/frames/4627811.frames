There was a significant increase in the SF-36 subscale 'physical function' after training (P = 0.004, Table 5), which did not differ between groups (time*group P = 0.11).
high-intensity interval training (HIT) for 12-weeks in patients NYHA II-III	continuous training (CT) 12-weeks inpatients NYHA II-III	maximal oxygen uptake	1205	1446	Training improved maximal workload, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) related to the predicted VO2peak, oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold, and maximal oxygen pulse (all P<0.05), whilst no differences were present between HIT and CT (N.S.).
