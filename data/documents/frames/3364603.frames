Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index	12171	12375	The mean value of L_RHI in the KBG-treatment period increased significantly, but not in the control period, and the 4-week changes between KBG-treatment and control periods showed statistical significance
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Serum nonesterified fatty acid	12386	12480	the mean values of NEFA, MDA, and sVCAM-1 in the KBG-treatment period decreased significantly,
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Malondialdehyde	803	1199	the mean value of the natural logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) increased and those of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 decreased significantly during the KBG-treatment period, but not during the control period, and 4-week changes of L_RHI, NEFA, and malondialdehyde between the 2 periods showed significance.
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1	13085	13167	the levels of MDA and sVCAM-1 in the KBG-treatment period decreased significantly.
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index	731	1199	In forty-nine (27, group A; 22, group B) patients completing all tests, the mean value of the natural logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) increased and those of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 decreased significantly during the KBG-treatment period, but not during the control period, and 4-week changes of L_RHI, NEFA, and malondialdehyde between the 2 periods showed significance.
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Malondialdehyde	731	1066	In forty-nine (27, group A; 22, group B) patients completing all tests, the mean value of the natural logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) increased and those of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 decreased significantly during the KBG-treatment period,
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1	12377	12600	Further, the mean values of NEFA, MDA, and sVCAM-1 in the KBG-treatment period decreased significantly, and 4-week changes of the former 2 parameters between KBG-treatment and control periods were statistically significant.
Keishibukuryogan 	Control	Serum nonesterified fatty acid	803	1199	the mean value of the natural logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) increased and those of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 decreased significantly during the KBG-treatment period, but not during the control period, and 4-week changes of L_RHI, NEFA, and malondialdehyde between the 2 periods showed significance.
