Vildagliptin	Placebo	Amplitude of glycemic excursion	1158	1327	CGM data showed that patients with vildagliptin add-on therapy had a significantly lower 24-h mean glucose concentration and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE).
Vildagliptin	Placebo	HbA1c	1041	1157	After 24 weeks of therapy, HbA1c values were significantly reduced at the endpoint in the vildagliptin add-on group.
Vildagliptin	Placebo	Insulin dose	13714	13925	Our data showed that the insulin dose was significantly decreased in the patients receiving vildagliptin add-on therapy compared to the patients in the placebo group (0.13 ± 0.03 vs. 0.17 ± 0.04 U/kg, P = 0.02).
Vildagliptin	Placebo	Amplitude of glycemic excursion	1179	1327	patients with vildagliptin add-on therapy had a significantly lower 24-h mean glucose concentration and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE).
Vildagliptin	Placebo	HbA1c	-1	-1	The HbA1c values were significantly reduced at the endpoint in the vildagliptin add-on group (8.5 ± 0.8% vs. 7.6 ± 0.8%, P < 0.01). However, the HbA1c values in patients who received the matched placebo therapy were unchanged from the baseline to the endpoint (8.8 ± 0.7% vs. 8.9 ± 1.3%, P > 0.05)
Vildagliptin	Placebo	Glucose concentration	1158	1327	CGM data showed that patients with vildagliptin add-on therapy had a significantly lower 24-h mean glucose concentration and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE).
Vildagliptin	Placebo	Severe hypoglycemia	1528	1591	A severe hypoglycemic episode was not observed in either group.
