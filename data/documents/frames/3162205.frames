Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft	Autograft alone	Definite postoperative complications	12726	12907	No definite postoperative complications, e.g., infection, abnormal vital signs or abnormal lab findings (including calcium and phosphorous levels), were encountered in either group.
Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft	Autograft alone	Lenke scores at 12 months	1352	1574	The control sides treated with an autograft showed significantly better Lenke scores than the study sides treated with β-CPP at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, but there was no difference between the two sides at 12 months
Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft	Autograft alone	Lenke scores at 12 months	1352	1575	The control sides treated with an autograft showed significantly better Lenke scores than the study sides treated with β-CPP at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, but there was no difference between the two sides at 12 months.
Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft	Autograft alone	Fusion rates	1576	1717	The fusion rates (confirmed by 3D-CT) were 87.0% in the β-CPP group and 89.1% in the autograft group, which were not significantly different.
Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft	Autograft alone	Mean fusion mass volume	1718	1965	The fusion mass volumes and bone absorption percentage at 12 months postoperatively were 2.49 mL (58.4%) and 1.89 mL (69.5%) for the β-CPP and autograft groups, respectively, and mean fusion mass volume was significantly higher in the β-CPP group.
