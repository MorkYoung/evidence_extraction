Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Change in daily dose of prednisolone	10923	11089	no significant differences were observed in the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission (Fig. 5), the change in daily dose of prednisolone
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Clinical remission rate	1568	1679	No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate	1568	1679	No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Disappearance of hematuria	10769	10909	However, the intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the hematuria disappearance rate between groups (Fig. 4).
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Reduction in proteinuria	1176	1679	Secondary outcomes were the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission rate, absolute changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, and the change in daily dose of prednisolone. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to MZR (n = 21) and control groups (n = 21). Nine patients in MZR group and 15 patients in the control group completed the study. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.

Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Clinical remission rate	1174	1276	. Secondary outcomes were the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission rate
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Disappearance of hematuria	10545	10899	Among patients who completed the study, the rate of hematuria disappearance was significantly higher in the MZR group than the control group at 30 months (100% vs. 53.3%, P < 0.05) and 36 months (88.9% vs. 46.7%, P < 0.05). However, the intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the hematuria disappearance rate between groups
Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	Standard treatment	Reduction in proteinuria	10430	10534	There were no significant differences in urine protein excretion between the two groups during the study
