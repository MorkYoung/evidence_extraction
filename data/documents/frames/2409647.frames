oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	The mean skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR) for all new bone events	-1	-1	The mean SMPR for all new bone events was significantly reduced with oral ibandronate 50 mg compared with placebo (P=0.004)
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	The mean skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR) for all new bone events	-1	-1	The mean SMPR for all new bone events was significantly reduced with oral ibandronate 50 mg compared with placebo (P=0.004) (Figure 1Figure 1
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	risk reduction for a skeletal event	9361	9650	Multivariate Poisson's regression analysis showed that the risk reduction for a skeletal event in the ibandronate 50 mg group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI=0.48, 0.79, P<0.0001), translating to a 38% risk reduction for ibandronate vs placebo.
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	the bone marker urinary CTx over the 96-week study period	-1	-1	Patients receiving oral ibandronate 50 mg showed a significant decrease from baseline in the bone marker urinary CTx over the 96-week study period compared with placebo (median change âˆ’77.3% and +11.0%, P<0.001) (Figure 2Figure 2
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	the number of skeletal fractures	-1	-1	There was no significant difference in the number of skeletal fractures with ibandronate compared with placebo (P=0.195).
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	the mean number of measurement periods with events per patient	-1	-1	Supportive analyses of new bone events demonstrated that the mean number of events and the mean number of measurement periods with events per patient were significantly reduced in the ibandronate group compared with placebo (P=0.008 and 0.015, respectively, Table 3 Table 3
oral ibandronate 50 mg	placebo	bone events requiring radiotherapy	-1	-1	Analysis of the individual components revealed that this effect was due primarily to significant reductions in bone events requiring radiotherapy (P<0.001) or surgery (P=0.037) (Figure 1).
