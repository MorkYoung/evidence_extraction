two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	adverse events	26623	26897	All of these were mild or moderate and included infectious diseases in four cases (malaria, tonsillitis or flu like illness), headache in two cases and musculo-skeletal problems in another two cases. None was considered related to the vaccinations. No HIV infection occured.
two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	The median titers in vaccinees who had received three HIV-DNA and two HIV-MVA immunizations followed by two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	27380	27599	All 35 (100%) vaccinees exhibited antibodies to subtype C CN54rgp140 after the first and second CN54rgp140/GLA-AF vaccination with median titers of 8100 (range 300–72900) and 24300 (range 2700 to > 72900), respectively.
two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	The concentration of CN54rgp140 antibodies	28629	29022	The concentration of CN54rgp140 antibodies increased significantly from a median of 0.861 (range 0.197–4.449 μg/ml) after the HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA vaccinations to a median of 9.866 (range 0.134–129.6 μg/ml) after the first dose of CN54rgp140/GLA-AF (p<0.001) and then increased further to a median of 17.75 μg/ml (range 0.277 to 219.8 μg/ml) after the second Env protein immunization (p<0.001).
two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	adverse events	900	1037	The vaccine was safe and well tolerated except for one episode of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that was classified as severe adverse event.
two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	ADCC-mediating antibody response	33437	33579	The magnitude of the ADCC-mediating antibody response against CM235 CRF01_AE did not differ significantly between the two time points (Fig 3).
two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations	baseline	ADCC-mediating antibody response	33895	34209	One of four volunteers who was unprimed prior to the two subtype C CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations had neutralizing activity against CM235 CRF01_AE after the second CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunization in the IMC/PBMC assay, yet none developed ADCC-mediating antibody responses after two CN54rgp140/GLA-AF immunizations.
