30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	VAS score	1569	1649	Postoperative VAS value at 18 h were significantly lower in group RD (P < 0.05).
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	required amount of diclofenac sodium injection as rescue analgesics in first 20 h of postoperative period	14267	14512	Table 4 and Figure 2 shows that group RD required less amount of diclofenac sodium injection as rescue analgesics than patients in group RC in first 20 h of postoperative period, and the difference is statistically highly significant (P < 0.01).
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	Onset of both sensory and motor block	1259	1388	Though with similar demographic profile in both groups, sensory and motor block in group RD (P < 0.05) was earlier than group RC.
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	Onset of both sensory and motor block	13323	13458	Onset of both sensory and motor block were earlier in RD group than group RC [Table 3] and they were clinically significant (P < 0.05).
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	suffered from bradycardia	14596	14694	Again group RD suffered from bradycardia, which was statistically higher (P < 0.05) than group RC.
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication	13829	14149	The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication, that is, the duration of analgesia was 821.11 min in the dexmedetomidine group, but 768.24 min in the clonidine group. This difference (about 52.87 min) was highly significant (P < 0.006) statistically as well as clinically [Table 4 and Figure 1].
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	VAS score	14514	14595	Figure 3 shows that VAS score was of much higher value in group RC than RD group.
30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 100 Î1⁄4g of dexmedetomidine (RD)	30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine + 75 Î1⁄4g clonidine (RC)	required amount of diclofenac sodium injection as rescue analgesics in first 20 h of postoperative period	1488	1567	total need for rescue analgesics was lower in group RD (P < 0.05) than group RC
