sitagliptin, 23 (0.3%)	placebo	Cases of pancreatic cancer	1166	1362	Cases of pancreatic cancer were numerically fewer with sitagliptin (9 [0.1%]) versus placebo (14 [0.2%]) (hazard ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.28–1.51], P = 0.32; 0.042 vs. 0.066 events/100 patient-years).
DPP-4i therapy	placebo	risk for acute pancreatitis	20375	20683	The overall rate of confirmed acute pancreatitis was low (0.095 events/100 patient-years) with a numerically increased but not statistically significant risk for acute pancreatitis with sitagliptin therapy (0.107/100 patient-years for sitagliptin treatment vs. 0.056/100 patient-years for placebo treatment).
DPP-4i therapy	placebo	Cases of pancreatic cancer	19702	19860	Meta-analysis for pancreatic cancer showed a nonsignificant effect of DPP-4i (risk ratio 0.54 [95% CI 0.28–1.04], P = 0.07) without evidence of heterogeneity.
DPP-4i therapy	placebo	Cases of pancreatic cancer	1166	1319	Cases of pancreatic cancer were numerically fewer with sitagliptin (9 [0.1%]) versus placebo (14 [0.2%]) (hazard ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.28–1.51], P = 0.32;
