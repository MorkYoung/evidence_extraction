Infliximab	Placebo	Endometrial thickness	-1	-1	Endometrial thickness was not affected by treatment, being at baseline and at the end of the treatment period for the infliximab group 5.2 (range 1.3?18) and 7.8 (1.9?11) mm and for the placebo group 7.7 (1.8?23) and 8.2 (3?15) mm, respectively.
Infliximab	Placebo	Pain killers intake	23427	23538	Over the whole observation period, the infliximab group had a slightly higher intake of pain killers (P < 0.01)
Infliximab	Placebo	Extend of the disease as visualized during surgery	21316	21601	During surgery, no obvious differences were observed in the extend of the disease, the macroscopic aspect of endometriosis (vascularization and sclerosis), the duration of surgery and bleeding estimates. Routine pathology (FC) also showed no obvious differences between the two groups.
Infliximab	Placebo	Tissue examination by routine pathology	21316	21601	During surgery, no obvious differences were observed in the extend of the disease, the macroscopic aspect of endometriosis (vascularization and sclerosis), the duration of surgery and bleeding estimates. Routine pathology (FC) also showed no obvious differences between the two groups.
