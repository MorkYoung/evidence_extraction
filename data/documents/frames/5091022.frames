3.2 mm drain	4.8 mm drain	Total blood suctioned after 48 hrs	966	1467	The total bleeding measured at the suction drains within 48 h was higher in Group II, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.005); in the first 24 h, there was major bleeding in Group II (mean 893 mL), with a significant difference (p = 0.004). Between 24 and 48 h, there was no statistically significant difference in both groups (p = 0.710). The total estimated bleeding was higher in Group I, with mean of 463 mL, versus 409 mL in Group II, with no statistical significance (p = 0.394).
3.2 mm drain	4.8 mm drain	Hematocrit after 72 hrs	845	965	Regarding the hematocrit, there were no differences between groups in measured periods (24, 48, and 72 h after surgery).
3.2 mm drain	4.8 mm drain	Hematocrit after 24 hrs	13806	13980	Regarding hematocrit, according to Fig. 2, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in the measured periods (24, 48, and 72 h postoperative),

3.2 mm drain	4.8 mm drain	Estimated blood loss	14606	14805	Estimated blood loss by the formula proposed by Mercuriali and Inghilleri14 (Fig. 6) was higher in Group I, with a mean of 463 mL versus Group II, 409 mL, with no statistical significance, p = 0.394.
