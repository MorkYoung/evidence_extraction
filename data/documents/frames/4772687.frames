Cal/BD aerosol foam	Cal/BD ointment	treatment success	-1	-1	By treatment end (week 4), a significantly larger proportion of patients using Cal/BD aerosol foam achieved treatment success compared with those using Cal/BD ointment (54.6% [n = 77/141] vs. 43.0% [n = 58/135]; mean difference 11.6%; odds ratio (OR) 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.8; p = 0.025; Figure 3).
Cal/BD aerosol foam at week 1 and week 4	Cal/BD ointment at week 1 and week 4	mean modified psoriasis area and severity index (mPASI) score	-1	-1	mPASI further demonstrated statistically significant improvement in disease status for patients using Cal/BD aerosol foam versus those using ointment.
Cal/BD aerosol foam at week 1 and week 4	Cal/BD ointment at week 1 and week 4	mean modified psoriasis area and severity index (mPASI) score	-1	-1	There was a significant difference in adjusted mean mPASI score between Cal/BD aerosol foam and Cal/BD ointment at week 1 (mean difference –0.7; 95% CI –1.1, –0.3; p = 0.001) and week 4 (mean difference –0.6; 95% CI –1.1, –0.2; p = 0.005; Figure 4).
