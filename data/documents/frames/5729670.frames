Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Mortality	22921	22999	No mortality was reported in either of the two groups during the study period.
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Mean blood glucose	1372	1508	The mean blood glucose in the experimental and the control group was 170.32 ± 33.46 mg/dl and 221.05 ± 49.72, respectively (P = 0.0001).
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion	22227	22535	The parameters for glycemic variability (SD of blood glucose, SD of premeal blood glucose, mean delta blood glucose, mean daily SD, and MAGE) were all significantly lower in patients in the experimental group [Table 11]. The experimental group had lower glycemic variability as compared to the control group.
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Mean blood glucose	1372	1507	The mean blood glucose in the experimental and the control group was 170.32 ± 33.46 mg/dl and 221.05 ± 49.72, respectively (P = 0.0001)
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Premeal blood glucose	22227	22535	The parameters for glycemic variability (SD of blood glucose, SD of premeal blood glucose, mean delta blood glucose, mean daily SD, and MAGE) were all significantly lower in patients in the experimental group [Table 11]. The experimental group had lower glycemic variability as compared to the control group.
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursion	1509	1616	The parameters for glycemic variability were all significantly lower in patients in the experimental group.
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Premeal blood glucose	21493	21676	The mean blood glucose and all the other blood glucose readings including fasting, prelunch, predinner, bedtime, and premeal overall were all significantly lower in experimental group
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Severe hypoglycemia 	22637	22919	The hypoglycemia event rates (hypoglycemia defined by blood glucose <70 mg/dl) were low in both the groups [Table 12]. None of the patients in our study in either of the groups developed severe hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose <50 mg/dl and/or associated with come or seizure)
Correctional insulin	Standard basal-bolus insulin	Severe hypoglycemia 	22756	22843	None of the patients in our study in either of the groups developed severe hypoglycemia
