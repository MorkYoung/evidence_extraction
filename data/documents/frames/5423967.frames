intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI)	diabetes support and education (DSE)	light touch sensation in the feet	21802	22213	In an additional post hoc analysis the data were analysed as a reading of <8 perceived pricks on either the right or the left foot. This was present in 34.5% of the participants in the DSE group and 30.4% of the participants in the ILI group (p = 0.008), suggesting that the ILI group participants may have maintained slightly better light touch sensation in the feet than did the DSE group participants.Table 1
