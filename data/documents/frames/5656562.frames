CYP3A5 Poor metabolizers 	CYP3A5 Extensive metabolizers 	Sildenafil levels	7818	8033	Based on previous evidence, and depending on the gene, the metabolizer status was defined, for example, as poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), extensive metabolizer (EM), or ultra metabolizer (UM).
CYP3A5 Poor metabolizers 	CYP3A5 Extensive metabolizers 	Sildenafil levels	15279	15571	In regards to the CYP3A5 inferred phenotype, although PM tended to have higher concentrations, particularly in the Caucasian subgroup, P values did not reach our significance corrected threshold in the overall population nor in the specific Caucasian subgroup (all P values > 0.14, Figure 3).
CYP2C9 Poor metabolizers 	CYP2C9 Extensive metabolizers 	Sildenafil levels	15157	15266	No association was observed between the CYP2C9 inferred phenotype and the sildenafil concentration:dose ratio
CYP2C9 Intermediate metabolizers 	CYP2C9 Poor metabolizers 	Sildenafil levels	15157	15278	No association was observed between the CYP2C9 inferred phenotype and the sildenafil concentration:dose ratio (Figure 2).
