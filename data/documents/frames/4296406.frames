treatment with omeprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day), pantoprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day) 	IV pantoprazole (40 mg every day) for up to 14 days	the mean of the gastric pH alteration	1553	1757	On each of the 14 trial days the mean of the gastric pH alteration was significantly higher in omeprazole and pantoprazole suspension-treated patients than in IV pantoprazole-treated patients (P < 0.001).
treatment with omeprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day), pantoprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day) 	IV pantoprazole (40 mg every day) for up to 14 days	Incidence of pneumonia	13593	13824	Sixteen (88.9%) patients from IV pantoprazole treated group, 14 (77.8%) patients from omeprazole suspension-treated group and 17 (85%) patients who had received pantoprazole suspension were diagnosed as having nosocomial pneumonia.
treatment with omeprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day), pantoprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day) 	IV pantoprazole (40 mg every day) for up to 14 days	Incidence of pneumonia	19241	19542	These findings indicate that extemporaneous preparations of omeprazole and pantoprazole oral suspension are more effective than IV pantoprazole in increasing gastric pH in critically ill-patients without no significant difference in the rate of nosocomial pneumonia between the three treatment groups.
