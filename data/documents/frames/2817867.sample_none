1	45	chemotherapy	RFA	5 - year overall survival	Furthermore, the 5-year overall survival for patients who had RFA was significantly inferior to those who had resection, even though patient characteristics and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were similar between groups.
2	119	RFA	resection	complications	More patients developed complications with resection compared to RFA (59% compared to 43%), but the difference was not statistically significant.
3	124	RFA	resection	median survival	OVERALL SURVIVAL: The median survival for patients who had resection, RFA, and resection in combination with RFA of their CRC metastases was 3.8 years (95% CI = 3.0 to 5.9 years), 2.6 years (95% CI = 1.8 to 3.3 years), and 2.3 (95% CI = 1.6 to 3.2 years), respectively.
4	124	RFA	resection , RFA	median survival	OVERALL SURVIVAL: The median survival for patients who had resection, RFA, and resection in combination with RFA of their CRC metastases was 3.8 years (95% CI = 3.0 to 5.9 years), 2.6 years (95% CI = 1.8 to 3.3 years), and 2.3 (95% CI = 1.6 to 3.2 years), respectively.
5	124	resection	resection , RFA	median survival	OVERALL SURVIVAL: The median survival for patients who had resection, RFA, and resection in combination with RFA of their CRC metastases was 3.8 years (95% CI = 3.0 to 5.9 years), 2.6 years (95% CI = 1.8 to 3.3 years), and 2.3 (95% CI = 1.6 to 3.2 years), respectively.
6	147	hepatic resection	RFA	local recurrences	Over the course of the study (mean follow-up of 46 months for patients undergoing RFA), 60% of patients who had only open RFA suffered local recurrences compared to 7% of patients who underwent hepatic resection (P < .0005).
7	184	hepatic resection	RFA	survival and recurrence	RFA was associated with worse survival and recurrence compared to hepatic resection in all analyses in this study.
