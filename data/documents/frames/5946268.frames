Supplemental Se	Control patients	10-year overall survival rate and 10-year disease free survival rate	6949	7225	The calculated 10-year overall survival rate of patients in the SeG was 55.3% compared to 42.7% in the CG (p = 0.09). The 10-year disease free survival rate was not different, i.e., a calculated 80.1% in Se-supplemented as compared to 83.2% in the control patients (p = 0.65).
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Dysphagia in patients suffering from head and neck tumors	7925	8126	A significant reduction of dysphagia during the last week of irradiation was observed in response to supplemental Se, especially in the patients with higher plasma and whole blood Se levels (p = 0.04).
Supplemental Se	Control patients	10-year overall survival rate and 10-year disease free survival rate	6950	7225	he calculated 10-year overall survival rate of patients in the SeG was 55.3% compared to 42.7% in the CG (p = 0.09). The 10-year disease free survival rate was not different, i.e., a calculated 80.1% in Se-supplemented as compared to 83.2% in the control patients (p = 0.65).
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Reduction in radiation-induced diarrhea	6780	6948	side effects were less frequent and severe in the SeG and the actuarial incidence of at least CTC 2 diarrhea was significantly reduced in the SeG as compared to the CG.
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Dysphagia in patients suffering from head and neck tumors	7692	8126	A second randomized Se supplementation study in radiation therapy was conducted with patients suffering from head and neck tumors. This study was conducted with 39 patients, of which 22 were enrolled into the SeG and 17 as controls. A significant reduction of dysphagia during the last week of irradiation was observed in response to supplemental Se, especially in the patients with higher plasma and whole blood Se levels (p = 0.04).
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Se concentrations in whole blood	6707	6779	both whole blood and plasma Se levels increased in the SeG. Importantly,
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Ageusia rate	8144	8316	oss of taste (ageusia) as a typical side effect was observed more frequently in the CG as compared to the SeG, however without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.172)
Supplemental Se	Control patients	Ageusia rate	8143	8316	loss of taste (ageusia) as a typical side effect was observed more frequently in the CG as compared to the SeG, however without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.172)
