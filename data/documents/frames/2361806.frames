Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Time to treatment failure	1068	1213	For ILF and ELF, respectively, median progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months, time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (P=0.4542)
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Overall response rates	927	1066	Overall response rates over the entire treatment period for ILF and ELF were 43 and 24%, respectively (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.97; P=0.0467)
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Time to treatment failure	1068	1270	For ILF and ELF, respectively, median progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months, time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (P=0.4542), and overall survival was 10.8 vs 8.3 months (P=0.2818).
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Clinical response rates at 14 weeks	737	925	The objective clinical response rates after 14 weeks treatment (primary end point) were 30% for ILF and 17% for ELF (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29–1.13, P=0.0766)
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Grade 3/4 digestive system toxic events	17079	17236	There were more grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxic events with ILF, notably diarrhoea, which was reported by 18% of patients compared with no reports with ELF.
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Overall survival	1068	1270	For ILF and ELF, respectively, median progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months, time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (P=0.4542), and overall survival was 10.8 vs 8.3 months (P=0.2818).
Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Clinical response rates at 14 weeks	737	926	The objective clinical response rates after 14 weeks treatment (primary end point) were 30% for ILF and 17% for ELF (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29–1.13, P=0.0766).

Irinotecan with high-dose 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ILF)	Etoposide with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (ELF)	Progression-free survival	15420	15727	Compared with ELF, the ILF regimen extended median progression-free survival, median time to treatment failure and median overall survival (Table 4). However, when the treatment groups were compared by log-rank test, there was no significant difference between the two treatments for any of these parameters
