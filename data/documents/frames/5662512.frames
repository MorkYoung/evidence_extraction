Proanthocyanidin	Casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate	Microhardness 	1362	1545	Pairwise comparisons of the groups revealed that there was no significant difference between groups C and PA, PA and CP, F and PAF, F and FCP, PAF and FCP, and PACP and FPACP (P>0.05)
Proanthocyanidin	Control	Microhardness 	12441	12816	One-way ANOVA showed significant differences among the groups (P<0.001). Pairwise comparisons of the groups revealed no significant differences between groups C and PA (P=0.972), PA and CP (P= 0.189), F and PAF (P=1.000), F and FCP (P=1.000), PAF and FCP (P=1.000), and PACP and PAFCP (P= 0.826); but significant differences were found between other groups (P<0.05; Table 1).
