Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	baseline	the extent of root coverage at 6 months	15731	15920	At six months, the extent of root coverage achieved at three months was slightly reduced in both groups, but this change was significant (P < 0.01) in group A and nonsignificant in group B.
Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF	keratinized tissue	1819	2026	The width of keratinized tissue was also significantly (P < 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in group B (2.30 ± 1.06 mm) than in group A (1.21 ± 0.67 mm
Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF	keratinized tissue	17908	18179	At six months there was a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the width of KT in both the groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the membrane group (2.30 ± 1.06) than in the non-membrane (1.21 ± 0.67) group at the six month follow-up [Table 4].
Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF	depth reduction	15921	16221	Both treatments resulted in significant greater recession depth reduction (P < 0.001), amounting to an average 1.30 ± 0.63 mm in group A and 1.82 ± 0.49 mm in group B at the six-month follow-up, but the reduction was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for group B than group A [Table 1] [Figures 8–15].
Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF	probing depth changes	1507	1615	he probing depth changes were significant (P < 0.01) for both groups, but the difference was nonsignificant.
Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)	Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF	probing depth changes	16567	16744	At the six-month follow-up, the probing depth changes were significant (P < 0.01) for both the treatments and the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant [Table 2].
