perioperative oral extended-release tapentadol	extended-release oxycodone/naloxone	Incidence of constipation	-1	-1	The incidence of constipation was 35% in the tapentadol vs. 30% in the oxycodone/naloxone group (p = 0.33).
perioperative oral extended-release tapentadol	extended-release oxycodone/naloxone	Pain intensity during exercise in the first 24h of post operatory	1578	1797	Mean maximum pain intensity during exercise in the first 24 h after surgery was 3.8 ± 1.9 (tapentadol) and 3.8 ± 2.1 (oxycodone/naloxone). Statistically tapentadol was non-inferior but not superior to oxycodone/naloxone
