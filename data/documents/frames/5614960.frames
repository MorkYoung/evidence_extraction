Implementation intention condition	Control	Perceived pain	21667	21902	In the final 10% of the task, implementation intention participants (M = 8.2, SD = 2.5) reported significantly more intense pain than control participants (M = 6.8, SD = 2.7), t(60) = 2.09, p = 0.041, g = 0.38 and W = 326.5, p = 0.031.
Implementation intention condition	Control	Task commitment	19214	19521	Participants in the implementation intention condition (M = 6.0, SD = 0.7) reported lower task commitment than participants in the control condition (M = 6.3, SD = 0.6) after having completed the task, and this difference approached significance, t(60) = 1.87, p = 0.066, g = 0.34, and W = 602.5, p = 0.079.
Implementation intention condition	Control	Perceived exertion	1679	1915	Compared to the control condition, participants in the implementation intention condition reported substantially greater increases in RPE during the second half of the task and reached higher total values of RPE before task termination.
Implementation intention condition	Control	Time to failure	19570	19850	Descriptively, participants in the implementation intention condition (M = 8.5 min, SD = 4.0) performed the endurance task about 1 min longer than control participants (M = 7.5 min, SD = 3.0), but this difference was not significant, t(60) = 1.10, p = 0.274 and W = 408, p = 0.326
Implementation intention condition	Control	Perceived exertion	20903	21131	In the final 10% of the task, implementation intention participants (M = 9.4, SD = 1.7) reported significantly higher RPE than control participants (M = 8.2, SD = 2.5), t(56.8) = 2.09, p = 0.026, g = 0.41 and W = 318, p = 0.020.
Implementation intention condition	Control	Perceived pain	21197	21356	We found a significant main effect of Time-to-Failure, F(9, 463.29) = 296.19, p < 0.001, indicating that perceptions of pain increased over the endurance task.
Implementation intention condition	Control	Time to failure	1437	1543	No differences emerged between implementation intention and control participants regarding time to failure
