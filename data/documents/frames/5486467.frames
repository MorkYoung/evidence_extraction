PA21	Placebo	Decrease in serum phosphorus levels	1537	1785	PA21 was an effective and safe treatment that decreased serum phosphorus levels starting at 1 week of treatment when administered as one 250-mg tablet three times/day. PA21 demonstrated a dose-dependent phosphorus lowering effect up to 3000 mg/day.
PA21	placebo	Time course of mean serum phosphorus levels	14113	14351	Time course of mean serum phosphorus levels (full analysis set). The mean serum phosphorus levels were significantly higher in all the PA21 groups in all the time-points after administering the PA21 dose (all P < 0.001, one-sample t test)
PA21	placebo	Cumulative achievement rates of target serum phosphorus levels	14580	14726	The cumulative achievement rates were significantly higher in all the PA21 groups than in the placebo group (all * P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test)
PA21	placebo	Cumulative achievement rates of target serum phosphorus levels	-1	-1	The cumulative achievement rates for target serum phosphorus level (≤6 mg/dL) at each time-point are shown in Fig. 4. The cumulative achievement rates were significantly higher in all the PA21 groups than in the placebo group (all P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test).Fig. 4
PA21	Placebo	Decrease in serum phosphorus levels	914	1289	The change in serum phosphorus level was significantly greater in each PA21 group than in the placebo group (analysis of covariance: P < 0.001 for all groups). A dose-dependent change in serum phosphorus levels was observed in the PA21 groups. A notable decrease in mean serum phosphorus levels to the target level of ≤6 mg/dL was shown starting at Week 1 in all PA21 groups.
PA21	placebo	Time course of mean serum phosphorus levels	914	1073	The change in serum phosphorus level was significantly greater in each PA21 group than in the placebo group (analysis of covariance: P < 0.001 for all groups).
