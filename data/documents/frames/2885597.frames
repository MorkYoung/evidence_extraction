fenofibrate plus UDCA	UDCA monotherapy	total cholesterol	774	927	Significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in the combination treatment group.
fenofibrate plus UDCA	UDCA monotherapy	alanine aminotranferase	928	1150	The serum activities of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotranferase also decreased in this group compared with baseline (-32.6%; p=0.012, -44%; p=0.031 and -16.9%; p=0.029, respectively)
fenofibrate plus UDCA	UDCA monotherapy	triglycerides	8038	8171	The addition of fenofibrate to UDCA resulted in significant decreases in the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-C
fenofibrate plus UDCA	UDCA monotherapy	triglycerides	516	927	Ten patients (57.2Â±13.3 years old) with PBC and persistent elevations of liver enzymes after treatment with UDCA (600 mg/day) were randomized to continue UDCA (4 patients) or to receive micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day) plus UDCA (6 patients) for 8 weeks. Significant reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in the combination treatment group.

fenofibrate plus UDCA	UDCA monotherapy	gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase	928	1283	The serum activities of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotranferase also decreased in this group compared with baseline (-32.6%; p=0.012, -44%; p=0.031 and -16.9%; p=0.029, respectively). In contrast, no significant alterations in liver enzymes or lipid profile were observed in patients who continued UDCA monotherapy.
