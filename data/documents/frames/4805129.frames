IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (1000 mg)	Oral iron 	Haemoglobin increase from baseline	-1	-1	the difference estimate for A1 versus B was 0.27, 95% CI: 0.015; 0.53, P < 0.001, and for A2 versus B, it was 0.17, 95% CI: âˆ’0.055; 0.39, P < 0.001.
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (1000 mg)	Oral iron 	Iron concentration	18314	18502	There was a statistically significant larger increase in serum iron concentration from baseline to Week 1 and Week 2 in Group A compared with Group B (Week 1: P < 0.001; Week 2: P = 0.003)
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (500 mg)	Oral iron 	Serum-ferritin	18732	18956	There was a statistically significant larger increase in serum-ferritin concentration and TSAT, and larger decrease in TIBC, from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 in Group A compared with Group B (P < 0.001 for serum ferritin
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (500 mg)	Oral iron 	Iron concentration	18314	18513	There was a statistically significant larger increase in serum iron concentration from baseline to Week 1 and Week 2 in Group A compared with Group B (Week 1: P < 0.001; Week 2: P = 0.003) (Table 4).
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (1000 mg)	Oral iron 	Haemoglobin increase from baseline	1131	1330	Iron isomaltoside 1000 was both non-inferior to oral iron at Week 4 (P < 0.001) and sustained a superior increase in haemoglobin from Week 3 until the end of the study at Week 8 (P = 0.009 at Week 3)
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (500 mg)	Oral iron 	Iron concentration	18314	18502	There was a statistically significant larger increase in serum iron concentration from baseline to Week 1 and Week 2 in Group A compared with Group B (Week 1: P < 0.001; Week 2: P = 0.003)
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (500 mg)	Oral iron 	Serum-ferritin	1432	1536	Serum-ferritin and transferrin saturation concentrations were also significantly increased with IV iron.
IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (500 mg)	Oral iron 	Iron concentration	18514	18688	Similar results were observed when Group A1 was compared with Group B (Supplementary Table S1) and when Group A2 was compared with Group B at Week 2 (Supplementary Table S2).
