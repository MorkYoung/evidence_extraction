L-DOPA and rivastigmine	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	1321	1463	As predicted, L-DOPA and rivastigmine resulted in enhanced PAS-induced LTP in the DLPFC and dextromethorphan inhibited it compared to placebo.
L-DOPA and rivastigmine	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	22166	22470	Further, post hoc pairwise comparisons against placebo (PAS-induced LTP = 1.25, SD = 0.14), with a Bonferroni correction, revealed that LTP was significantly increased after the intake of L-DOPA (PAS-induced LTP = 1.64, SD = 0.37, p = 0.004) or rivastigmine (PAS-induced LTP = 1.63, SD = 0.40, p = 0.009)
baclofen	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	22583	22692	there was no change after the intake of baclofen (PAS-induced LTP = 1.15, SD = 0.52, p = 0.54; Figures 2, 3).
Dextromethorphan	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	22471	22569	and decreased after the intake of dextromethorphan (PAS-induced LTP = 0.95, SD = 0.19, p = 0.007).
baclofen	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	1464	1553	In contrast, baclofen did not significantly suppress PAS-induced LTP compared to placebo.
Dextromethorphan	placebo	PAS-induced LTP	1321	1463	As predicted, L-DOPA and rivastigmine resulted in enhanced PAS-induced LTP in the DLPFC and dextromethorphan inhibited it compared to placebo.
