midazolam (Group 1)	clonidine (Group 2)	consumption of propofol	10654	10922	A significant propofol sparing effect was noted with the use of midazolam (P < 0.001) and clonidine (P < 0.001). Though propofol consumption was less clinically with midazolam premedication compared with clonidine, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.761).
clonidine (Group 2)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	consumption of propofol	10472	10605	Mean dosage of propofol used in mg/kg were 78.57 ± 22.15 in Group 1, 80.14 ± 20.81 in Group 2 and 109.43 ± 20.14 in Group 3 [Table 2]
midazolam (Group 1)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	consumption of propofol	1512	1640	A significant reduction in consumption of propofol with the use of midazolam (P < 0.001) and clonidine (P < 0.001) was observed.
clonidine (Group 2)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	consumption of propofol	1512	1640	A significant reduction in consumption of propofol with the use of midazolam (P < 0.001) and clonidine (P < 0.001) was observed.
midazolam (Group 1)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	consumption of propofol	1512	1639	A significant reduction in consumption of propofol with the use of midazolam (P < 0.001) and clonidine (P < 0.001) was observed
midazolam (Group 1)	clonidine (Group 2)	consumption of propofol	10774	10921	propofol consumption was less clinically with midazolam premedication compared with clonidine, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.761)
midazolam (Group 1)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	complain of mild pain	12179	12317	Majority of subjects complained of mild pain in all the three groups showing no statistically significant intergroup difference (P > 0.05)
clonidine (Group 2)	normal saline (Group 3) (control)	complain of mild pain	12179	12318	Majority of subjects complained of mild pain in all the three groups showing no statistically significant intergroup difference (P > 0.05).
