GnRH agonist	control	implantation rate (IR)	-1	-1	Implantation rate, n (%) <TAB> 104/381 (27) <TAB> 92/386 (23) <TAB> 1.2 (0.9–1.7) <TAB> 0.27
GnRH agonist	control	Ongoing pregnancy (OP) rate	1224	1343	Similarly, the OP rate was 37% in the treatment group and 31% in the control group [OR 1.3 (95% CI 0.8–2.0), P < 0.23].
GnRH agonist	control	live birth (LB) rate	1344	1453	The LB rate was 36% in the treatment group and 31% in the control group [OR: 1.3 (95% CI 0.8–2.0), P < 0.27].
GnRH agonist	control	follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P)	939	1072	serum concentrations of FSH, LH, E2, and P on day OPU + 7 were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group,
GnRH agonist	control	implantation rate (IR)	1073	1223	the IR was not statistically different between the treatment group (27%) and the control group (23%) [odds ratio (OR) 1.2 (95% CI 0.9–1.7), P < 0.27].
GnRH agonist	control	follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P)	930	1071	Although serum concentrations of FSH, LH, E2, and P on day OPU + 7 were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group
