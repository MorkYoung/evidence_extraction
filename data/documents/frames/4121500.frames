Group L - loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg for 10 minutes	group H - 1.0 μg/kg	oral dryness, tachycardia, excessive bradycardia and use of atropine and ephedrine	8742	8879	Incidence of oral dryness, tachycardia, excessive bradycardia and use of atropine and ephedrine did not show any significant differences.
L received a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg 	group H - 1.0 μg/kg	Bispectral index (BIS) after 10 minutes interval	1061	1184	Between two groups, BIS values showed a significant differences only at T10, BIS of group H was lower than that of group L.
Group L - loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg for 10 minutes	group H - 1.0 μg/kg	heart rate	1313	1397	Other vital signs and complications showed a minimal differences between two groups.
Group L - loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg for 10 minutes	group H - 1.0 μg/kg	heart rate	8126	8296	Throughout this study, heart rate decreased significantly rather than T0 value in the both groups. But, there were no significant differences between two groups (Fig. 2).

Group L - loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg for 10 minutes	group H - 1.0 μg/kg	bradycardia, hypoxemia, hypotension and hypertension	8600	8740	There were no significant differences between two groups in the incidence of bradycardia, hypoxemia, hypotension and hypertension (Table 3).
