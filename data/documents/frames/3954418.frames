women with higher baseline cotinine levels	baseline	odds of cessation at 1 month	908	1200	At 1 month, odds of cessation were greater among those who completed full time education at >16 years of age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.24–2.67, p = .002) but they were lower in women with higher baseline cotinine levels (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90–0.95, p < .001).
women with higher baseline cotinine levels	baseline	odds of cessation at 1 month	13287	13469	Participants who had a higher baseline cotinine (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91–0.96, p < .001 for a 10ng/ml increase) had significantly lower odds of cessation at 1 month after quit date.
women with a higher baseline cotinine level 	baseline	odds of cessation at delivery	17049	17358	In the final multivariable model, women who continued school beyond the compulsory minimum age (16 years) were more likely to stop smoking (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.16–3.07, p = .010) and women with a higher baseline cotinine level were less likely to achieve cessation (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92–0.99, p < .010).
