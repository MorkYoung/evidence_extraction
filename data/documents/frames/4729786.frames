negative training (NT) (pull negative, push positive pictures)	positive training (PT) (vice versa)	the three-way interaction of probe location, picture type, and group	-1	-1	Because of the similar effects observed for trained and untrained pictures, the three-way interaction of probe location, picture type, and group was not significant, F(1, 139) = .10, p > .7, Î·p2 = .001.
negative training (pull negative, push positive pictures)	positive training (vice versa)	mood scales, stress scales	26343	26456	The analyses revealed neither an immediate training effect on the mood scales nor on the stress scales (p > .398)

Because of the similar effects observed for trained and untrained pictures, the three-way interaction of probe location, picture type, and group was not significant, F(1, 139) = .10, p > .7, ηp2 = .001.

PT groups (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	sham-training (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	compatibility effect	50995	51331	Participants who received the positivity training showed an increase in their compatibility effect after the training, and thus a stronger positivity bias. This was true despite the fact that both dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants showed a positive bias before the training already. No such change was found in the control group.
PT groups (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	sham-training (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	main effect of training on the stress ratings	47940	48090	participants in the training group showed lower scores on the stress subscale than those in the control group (M = 2.8, SD = 1.1 vs. M = 4.1, SD = .9)
dysphoric	non-dysphoric	compatibility effect	42705	42954	The group of dysphoric individuals did not significantly differ from the group of non-dysphoric individuals on the compatibility effect prior to the training (dysphoric: M = 92, SD = 139; non-dysphoric: M = 45, SD = 99; t(59) = 1.55, p > .1, d = .39
PT groups (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	sham-training (dysphoric, non-dysphoric)	tension	49518	49743	Although this interaction effect fell short of statistical significance, it is compatible with our finding that the training differentially affected emotional vulnerability to stress in dysphoric and non-dysphoric individuals
