control group	baseline	Salivary TF	9462	9573	In the control group, there was no statistically significant difference of TF in 3 different measurement means.
hyaluronic acid (HA)	control	Swelling	10807	10911	3rd day outcomes of orotragus and mentotragus measurements showed more swelling in the HA group (p<0.05)
hyaluronic acid (HA)	control	bleeding time	10482	10592	Bleeding time was longer in HA group than in the control group. (7.17±١.٣٦ versus ٥.٦٤±١.٤٦ minutes, p<٠.05 ).
hyaluronic acid (HA)	control	bleeding time	10375	10592	The mean ± SD of bleeding time in HA group showed statistically significant difference from control group. Bleeding time was longer in HA group than in the control group. (7.17±١.٣٦ versus ٥.٦٤±١.٤٦ minutes, p<٠.05 ).
hyaluronic acid (HA)	control	Swelling	10799	10921	However 3rd day outcomes of orotragus and mentotragus measurements showed more swelling in the HA group (p<0.05)(Table 3).
hyaluronic acid (HA)	baseline	Salivary TF	9574	9692	Salivary TF was significantly lesser after 1 week in HA group in One-Way ANOVA for Repeated Measurement test (p<0,05).
control group	baseline	Salivary TF	9462	9572	In the control group, there was no statistically significant difference of TF in 3 different measurement means
