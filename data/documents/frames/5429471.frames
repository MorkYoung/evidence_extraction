No irrigant	Smear Clear, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) and saline	bond strength	1291	1398	The control group showed the highest bond strength with significant differences with other groups (P<0.05).
saline	chlorhexidine (CHX)	bond strength	10830	10917	Other pairwise comparisons did not show statistically significant differences (P>0.05).
saline	Smear Clear	bond strength	10676	10776	. Also, significant differences were noted in bond strength between saline and Smear Clear (P=0.007)
saline	Smear Clear	bond strength	10678	10829	Also, significant differences were noted in bond strength between saline and Smear Clear (P=0.007) and saline and sodium hypochlorite (P=0.001) groups.
saline	chlorhexidine (CHX)	bond strength	1291	1494	The control group showed the highest bond strength with significant differences with other groups (P<0.05). Among the experimental groups, the saline group had no significant difference with CHX (P=0.09)
saline	sodium hypochlorite	bond strength	17667	17909	In the current study, the push-out bond strength of the MTA group exposed to saline was the highest. Immersion in Smear Clear, CHX and NaOCl irrigants decreased the bond strength of MTA to dentin following the first 10 minutes of its setting.
saline	sodium hypochlorite	bond strength	10678	10829	Also, significant differences were noted in bond strength between saline and Smear Clear (P=0.007) and saline and sodium hypochlorite (P=0.001) groups.
