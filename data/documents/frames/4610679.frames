Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Mortality rate (after 8 years)	2139	2343	the estimated proportion alive was 77.9% in the intervention and 72.8% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%–8.5%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference)
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Influenza vaccinations	1978	2088	66% compared to 59% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09–1.66, p = 0.005)
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Mortality rate (after 8 years)	2090	2344	At 8 y, based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9% in the intervention and 72.8% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%–8.5%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference).
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Influenza vaccinations	1672	1800	At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Physical activity	1883	1972	70% compared to 62% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.16–1.77, p = 0.001)
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Influenza vaccinations	1978	2089	66% compared to 59% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09–1.66, p = 0.005).
Health risk assessment (HRA)	No HRA	Physical activity	1672	1973	At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group (based on z-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example, 70% compared to 62% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.16–1.77, p = 0.001),
