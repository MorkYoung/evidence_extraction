robotic-assisted navigation (Hansen Sensei® X)	standard navigation	mean LGE encirclement at 6 months follow-up	1360	1571	At 6 months follow-up, arrhythmia-free patients had an almost similar mean LGE encirclement (robotic 64%, standard 60%, P = 0.45) but in recurrences, LGE was higher in the robotic group (43% vs. 30%, P = 0.001).
robotic-assisted navigation (Hansen Sensei® X)	standard navigation	mean circumferential extent obtained by a combination of LGE&T2 signal overlay	13014	13193	On the early scans, mean circumferential extent obtained by a combination of LGE&T2 signal overlay was 94 ± 6% in the robotic group vs. 88% ± 10% (P = 0.03) in the standard group.
robotic-assisted navigation (Hansen Sensei® X)	standard navigation	Late gadolinium enhancement 	1215	1359	Late gadolinium enhancement remained the predominant signal with 56% encirclement in the robotic group vs. 45% in the standard group (P = 0.04).
