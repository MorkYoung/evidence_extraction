high-risk group	low-risk group	advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN)	1324	1447	The high-risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low-risk group (1.1% vs. 4.0%, P < .001).
high-risk group	low-risk group	advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN)	1448	1680	The discrimination performance of the present model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (AUC = 0.678, P < .001) and Schroy's CAN index (AUC = 0.672, P < .001).
final model	advanced CRN (ACN) index	discrimination performance using AUC (Area under the receiver operating curve) for high risk patients	35670	35833	The discrimination performance of the developed model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the ACN index (P < .001) or APCS (P < .001).
final model	Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (APCS)	discrimination performance using AUC (Area under the receiver operating curve) for high risk patients	35670	35833	The discrimination performance of the developed model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the ACN index (P < .001) or APCS (P < .001).
final model	advanced CRN (ACN) index	discrimination performance using AUC (Area under the receiver operating curve) for high risk patients	35281	35833	In the validation set, the discrimination performance of the final model was compared with that of the advanced CRN (ACN) index [14] and Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (APCS) [12] using the AUC (Fig 7). The AUC of the final model was 0.716 (95% CI, 0.691–0.741), whereas that of the ACN index was 0.672 (95% CI, 0.645–0.699), and that of the APCS was 0.678 (95% CI, 0.651–0.705). The discrimination performance of the developed model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the ACN index (P < .001) or APCS (P < .001).
final model	Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (APCS)	discrimination performance using AUC (Area under the receiver operating curve) for high risk patients	1222	1680	The developed model had good discrimination (AUC = 0.726) and was internally validated (AUC = 0.713). The high-risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low-risk group (1.1% vs. 4.0%, P < .001). The discrimination performance of the present model for high-risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (AUC = 0.678, P < .001) and Schroy's CAN index (AUC = 0.672, P < .001).
