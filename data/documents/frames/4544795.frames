BITT 	BoNT-A and control	Baseline characteristics	21460	21538	Overall, there were no significant differences between the groups at baseline.
BITT	No-BITT	ABILHAND-Kids logit units' score at 12 and 18 weeks	23361	23557	The children who received BITT scored significantly better at the ABILHAND-Kids logit units' score at 12 and 18 weeks (BITT from 1.301 to 2.264 and 2.190 and no-BITT from 1.092 to 1.173 and 0.796)
BoNT-A and BoNT-A + BITT	no-BoNT-A and BITT-only	Grasp finger score	25376	25637	The grasp finger score of the sandwich-making task differed significantly at 6 weeks comparing BoNT-A to no-BoNT-A (1.18 to 1.88 versus 1.69 to 1.60, p 0.011) and comparing BoNT-A + BITT to BITT-only (1.78 to 1.84 versus 1.76 to 1.63, p 0.020) favouring BoNT-A.
BITT 	BoNT-A and control	AHA unit score	22814	22928	With the AHA, our primary outcome measurement, no significant differences between the groups could be demonstrated
BITT 	BoNT-A and control	Baseline characteristics	21010	21537	characteristics and outcome measures at baseline of all children and treatment groups are depicted. The children in the control group and less in the BoNT-A-only group were clearly younger. Hand function impairment (Zancolli grade) was worst in the control group and in the BoNT-A-only group bimanual performance i.e., the MACS was worst. Children in the control group scored relatively low on the AHA units and the ABILHAND-Kids logit units' score. Overall, there were no significant differences between the groups at baseline
BITT	No-BITT	ABILHAND-Kids logit units' score at 24 weeks	23361	23628	The children who received BITT scored significantly better at the ABILHAND-Kids logit units' score at 12 and 18 weeks (BITT from 1.301 to 2.264 and 2.190 and no-BITT from 1.092 to 1.173 and 0.796); and not significantly better at 24 weeks (BITT 2.230, no BITT 1.114).
