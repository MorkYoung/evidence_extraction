Atorvastatin	Control	Mild to borderline airway responsiveness	11464	11699	Changes in airway responsiveness categories (e.g. from mild to borderline airway responsiveness) were not significant in atorvastatin group and placebo group (p-value= 0.131 for atorvastatin group and p value = 0.305 for placebo group)
Atorvastatin	Control	Moderate to severe airway responsiveness	909	1163	Changes in airway responsiveness categories (moderate to severe, mild, borderline, normal) after the intervention were not significant in atorvastatin group as in placebo group (p-value= 0.131 for atorvastatin group and p-value = 0.305 for placebo group)
Atorvastatin	Control	Peak expiratory flow rate	11956	12083	There were no significant difference between the alterations of PEFR, FEV1 and FEV1% in neither placebo nor atorvastatin group.
Atorvastatin	Control	Methacholine solution number which caused FEV1 decrease >20%	11701	11850	Changes in methacholine solution number which caused greater than 20% decrease in FEV1 were not significant between groups, either (p-value = 0.089).
Atorvastatin	Control	Mild to borderline airway responsiveness	909	1164	Changes in airway responsiveness categories (moderate to severe, mild, borderline, normal) after the intervention were not significant in atorvastatin group as in placebo group (p-value= 0.131 for atorvastatin group and p-value = 0.305 for placebo group).
Atorvastatin	Control	Methacholine solution number which caused FEV1 decrease >20%	1171	1351	changes in methacholine solution number (different concentrations of methacholine) which caused at least 20% decrease in FEV1 were not significant between groups (p-value = 0.089).
Atorvastatin	Control	Moderate to severe airway responsiveness	11464	11699	Changes in airway responsiveness categories (e.g. from mild to borderline airway responsiveness) were not significant in atorvastatin group and placebo group (p-value= 0.131 for atorvastatin group and p value = 0.305 for placebo group)
