Bifidobacterium lactis	Control	Monocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	t consumption of Bi-07 improved the phagocytic activity of monocytes (P < 0·001)
Galacto-oligosaccharides	Control	Monocytes and granulocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	The supplementations did not change the percentages of monocytes and granulocytes engaged in phagocytosis compared with maltodextrin
Bifidobacterium lactis	Galacto-oligosaccharides	Monocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	Phagocytic activity of monocytes in the probiotic group was higher than in the maltodextrin (P < 0·001) or prebiotic groups (P < 0·001)
Bifidobacterium lactis	Control	Monocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	Phagocytic activity of monocytes in the probiotic group was higher than in the maltodextrin (P < 0·001) or prebiotic groups (P < 0·001)
Bifidobacterium lactis	Galacto-oligosaccharides	Monocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	there was a higher percentage of phagocytosing monocytes in the probiotic group compared with the prebiotic (P = 0·005) group
Galacto-oligosaccharides	Control	Monocytes and granulocytes engaged in phagocytosis	-1	-1	The supplementations did not change the percentages of monocytes and granulocytes engaged in phagocytosis compared with maltodextrin (Fig. 2(a) and 2(b)); however, there was a higher percentage of phagocytosing monocytes in the probiotic group compared with the prebiotic (P = 0·005) group (Fig. 2(a))
