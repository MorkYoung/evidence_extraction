rivaroxaban or apixaban or dabigatran 	control (warfarin)	heparin dosages required to produce an ACT 15 min after the initial bolus that was identical to the control (110U/kg)	1474	1567	The NOAC groups required significantly larger doses of total heparin than the warfarin group.
rivaroxaban or apixaban or dabigatran 	control (warfarin)	heparin dosages required to produce an ACT 15 min after the initial bolus that was identical to the control (110U/kg)	1646	1843	The results of the comparison with warfarin (the control) indicated that dosages of 120 or 130 U/kg for dabigatran, and 130 U/kg for rivaroxaban and apixaban, were adequate initial heparin dosages.
the warfarin or dabigatran 	the rivaroxaban or apixaban 	activated clotting time (ACT)	-1	-1	The baseline ACTs in the control and dabigatran groups (151 ± 17 and 156 ± 15 s, respectively) were significantly longer than those in the rivaroxaban (135 ± 12 s) and apixaban (132 ± 17 s) groups (Fig. 2).
the warfarin or dabigatran 	the rivaroxaban or apixaban 	activated clotting time (ACT)	1027	1187	Baseline ACTs were longer in the warfarin (152 ± 16 s) and dabigatran (153 ± 13 s) groups than in the rivaroxaban (134 ± 13 s) and apixaban (133 ± 20 s) groups.
rivaroxaban or apixaban or dabigatran 	control (warfarin)	heparin dosages required to produce an ACT 15 min after the initial bolus that was identical to the control (110U/kg)	1189	1473	he initial bolus heparin dosages required to produce an ACT 15 min after the initial bolus that was identical to the control (333 ± 32 s) were 120 U/kg (318 ± 29 s) and 130 U/kg (339 ± 43 s) for dabigatran, 130 U/kg (314 ± 31 s) for rivaroxaban and 130 U/kg (317 ± 39 s) for apixaban.
rivaroxaban or apixaban or dabigatran 	control (warfarin)	protamine usage for haemostasis	17492	17689	No significant differences in protamine usage for haemostasis were found among the control and three NOAC groups (control, 13 ± 20; dabigatran, 26 ± 23; rivaroxaban, 25 ± 25; apixaban, 28 ± 28 mg).
