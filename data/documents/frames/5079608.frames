High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	loss of glycemic control - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	18222	18491	Failure was not associated with lower adherence to taking medication. Among those subjects who failed therapy, 62.5% had at least an 80% adherence to study medication on average compared with 50.3% in those who did not fail therapy by the end of the study (P = 0.0018).
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	oral disposition index (oDI) - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	1593	1728	. Longitudinally, participants with high adherence had significantly greater insulin sensitivity and oDI than those with low adherence.
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	significant depressive symptoms at baseline - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	1390	1531	A greater percentage of participants with low adherence had clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline (18% vs. 12%, P = 0.0415).
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	Adherence to medication - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	-1	-1	Adherence to medication significantly dropped over time (P < 0.0001), but there were no differences among treatment groups.
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	loss of glycemic control - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	1532	1594	No adherence threshold predicted the loss of glycemic control.
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	insulin sensitivity - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	18880	19003	≥80% medication adherence was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2A) (P = 0.0012) and higher oDI (P = 0.0248)
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	loss of glycemic control - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	22238	22365	With regard to the TODAY study primary outcome, we did not find an adherence threshold that predicted loss of glycemic control.
High adherence; taking ≥80% of medication	Low adherence; taking <80% of medication	oral disposition index (oDI) - 10–17 years old with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and ≥80% adherence to metformin therapy for ≥8 weeks	18880	19003	≥80% medication adherence was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2A) (P = 0.0012) and higher oDI (P = 0.0248)
