Zinc	Placebo	Hemoglobin after 18 months	13373	13688	In linear regression models including both MV and Zn treatment, MV treatment was associated with an increase in Hb of 0.2 g/dL (p ≤ .01) at 12 months and 0.3 g/dL (p ≤ .001) at 18 months. No differences in Hb values between infants treated with Zn and those with placebo or Zn + MV therapy were observed at any age.
