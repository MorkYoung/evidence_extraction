Low Ang-2 + bevacizumab	High Ang-2 + bevacizumab	Overall survival	14292	14471	Median OS in the entire population (Figure 2) was longer in patients with low compared with high Ang-2 levels (13.7 months vs 10.0 months, HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.93; P=0.0055)
Low Ang-2 	High Ang-2 	Liver metastasis	17025	17157	Logistic regression analysis confirmed that Ang-2 levels were strongly correlated with the frequency of liver metastasis at any time
Low Ang-2 	High Ang-2 	Liver metastasis	16779	17169	In non-Asian patients, the frequency of liver metastasis in the high vs low Ang-2 group was 45% and 27%, respectively. In Asian patients, the frequency of liver metastasis at baseline in the high vs low Ang-2 group was 37% and 23%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that Ang-2 levels were strongly correlated with the frequency of liver metastasis at any time (Figure 4).
