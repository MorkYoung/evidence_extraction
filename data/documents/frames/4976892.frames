DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine	Control	Signal intensities against EnvA at week 36	18351	18557	We found a significant difference in signal intensities against EnvA in the vaccinated arm (p = 0.0088; RM ANOVA) especially at week 36 (89% signal increase; p = 0.0054; Dunnett's multiple comparisons test)
DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine	Control	HIV-specific antibody response	1103	1273	We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency.
