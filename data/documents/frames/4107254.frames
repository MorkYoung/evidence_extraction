centers admitting ≥ 200 patients/year	centers admitting less than 200 patients/year	interested in joining randomized trials evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis	12509	12672	Centers admitting ≥ 200 per year were more interested in joining randomized trials evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis (70.67 vs. 45; p = 0.039),
centers admitting ≥ 200 patients/year	centers admitting less than 200 patients/year	New oral anticoagulants administration	12106	12277	New oral anticoagulants were more frequently (214/156 vs. 5/20) used in centers admitting less than 200 patients per year, which was statistically significant (p = 0.046).
centers with stroke unit	centers without stroke unit	Dextrans administration	11607	11697	Dextrans were less frequently used in centers with a stroke unit (6.6% vs. 13%, p = 0.05).
centers with stroke unit	centers without stroke unit	willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients	1299	1491	Centers admitting ≥ 200 patients/year (70.7% vs. 45%; p = 0.039), and those with stroke units (95 vs. 20; p = 0.031) were more willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods.
centers admitting ≥ 200 patients/year	centers admitting less than 200 patients/year	interested in joining randomized trials evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis	11997	12746	Additionally we compared the centers admitting < 200 patients/year with those admitting ≥ 200 patients/year. New oral anticoagulants were more frequently (214/156 vs. 5/20) used in centers admitting less than 200 patients per year, which was statistically significant (p = 0.046). There were no other statistical differences between centers admitting ≥ 200 and < 200 patients per year in terms of using other methods of prophylaxis or being willing to participate in a trial evaluating those methods (p > 0.05). Centers admitting ≥ 200 per year were more interested in joining randomized trials evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis (70.67 vs. 45; p = 0.039), but no statistical differences in terms of particular methods were found.
centers with stroke unit	centers without stroke unit	willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients	11698	11884	The centers with a stroke unit were also more willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients (95/132 vs. 20/38; p = 0.031), b
