early surgery <24 hours	late surgery 24-72 hours	mean motor score improvement - cases with incomplete TSCI (traumatic spinal cord injury)	1089	1221	For incomplete TSCI, the mean motor score improved from 77 (±22) to 92 (±12) in early, and from 68 (±22) to 82 (±16) in late surgery
early surgery <24 hours	late surgery 24-72 hours	Mean length of hospital	13538	13643	Mean length of hospital stay was 7±7.13 days for early, and 9.7±8.28 for late surgery (p>0.05) (Table 1).
early surgery <24 hours	late surgery 24-72 hours	no motor improvement - cases with complete TSCI (traumatic spinal cord injury)	13834	13947	For cases with complete TSCI, no improvement of mean ASIA motor score was observed in either group over 12 months
early surgery <24 hours	late surgery 24-72 hours	mean motor score improvement - cases with incomplete TSCI (traumatic spinal cord injury)	13949	14246	For incomplete TSCI, both groups showed improvement on follow-up visits (Figure 3). In the early surgery group, the mean motor score improved from 77(±22) on preoperative examination, to 92(±12) on 12-month follow-up visit. In the late surgery group, a change from 68(±22) to 82(±16) was observed.
