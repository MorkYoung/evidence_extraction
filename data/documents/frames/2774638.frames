white women	black women	obtained calcium from dairy 	12658	12764	White women obtained more calcium (630 [423] mg) from dairy than did black women (424 [373] mg, P < .004).
calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ)	24-hour recall	Estimation of underreported calcium as daily calcium intake increased	1156	1290	As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ.
white women	black women	difference in mean (SD) dairy calcium	12918	13227	Calcium from grains primarily came from fortified foods. Dairy was also the primary calcium source when the 24-hour recall data were analyzed, and a significant difference in mean (SD) dairy calcium intake between racial groups was found (243 [273] mg for black women, 444 [360] mg for white women, P < .001).
calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ)	24-hour recall	Estimation of total daily calcium intake	1014	1155	The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001).
white women	black women	difference in mean (SD) dairy calcium	12975	13227	Dairy was also the primary calcium source when the 24-hour recall data were analyzed, and a significant difference in mean (SD) dairy calcium intake between racial groups was found (243 [273] mg for black women, 444 [360] mg for white women, P < .001).
