Drug-eluting balloon + bare metal stent	Zotarolimus-eluting stent	Minimal luminal diameter	19597	19949	After the index PCI, there was significantly decreased minimal luminal diameter and less acute gain in the patients treated with DEB + BMS compared with those treated with ZES. The LL, thus the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the lesions treated with DEB + BMS than in those treated with ZES (0.50 ± 0.46 mm vs. 0.21 ± 0.44 mm; P < 0.001)
Drug-eluting balloon + bare metal stent	Zotarolimus-eluting stent	Late luminal loss	1067	1214	When comparing the DEB + BMS results with the ZES ones, LL was 0.50 ± 0.46 mm in DEB + BMS patients vs. 0.21 ± 0.44 mm in ZES patients (P < 0.001).
