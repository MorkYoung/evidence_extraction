nalbuphine hydrochloride in addition to levobupivacaine	normal saline in addition to levobupivacaine	time before rescue analgesic	1448	1589	time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in Group LN (P < 0.05) than Group LC
nalbuphine + levobupivacaine	levobupivacaine + saline	block duration	1411	1590	sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in Group LN (P < 0.05) than Group LC.
nalbuphine hydrochloride in addition to levobupivacaine	normal saline in addition to levobupivacaine	onset of both sensory and motor blocks	1341	1410	similar demographic profile and block (sensory and motor) onset time,
nalbuphine hydrochloride in addition to levobupivacaine	normal saline in addition to levobupivacaine	sensory and motor block duration	1411	1589	sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in Group LN (P < 0.05) than Group LC
nalbuphine hydrochloride	levobupivacaine + normal saline	Postoperative lower VAS scale	1591	1669	Postoperative VAS value at 24 h was significantly lower in Group LN (P < 0.05)
nalbuphine hydrochloride in addition to levobupivacaine	normal saline in addition to levobupivacaine	sensory and motor block duration	1411	1590	sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in Group LN (P < 0.05) than Group LC.
nalbuphine hydrochloride	levobupivacaine + normal saline	Postoperative lower VAS scale	1591	1807	Postoperative VAS value at 24 h was significantly lower in Group LN (P < 0.05). Intraoperative hemodynamics was comparable between two groups, and no any appreciable side effect was noted throughout the study period.
nalbuphine + levobupivacaine	levobupivacaine + saline	block duration	13224	13399	Table 4 and Figure 1 show that sensory and motor block durations were both clinically and statistically greater in the group receiving nalbuphine (LN) (P < 0.05) than Group LC
nalbuphine hydrochloride in addition to levobupivacaine	normal saline in addition to levobupivacaine	onset of both sensory and motor blocks	13070	13214	The onset of both sensory and motor blocks was statistically comparable between two groups [Table 3] and was clinically insignificant (P > 0.05)
