α-MSH	controls	Urine flow	15225	15352	During ten hours follow-up, urine output was significantly lower in the α-MSH group compared to the controls (Figure 2, p<0.05)
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)	control group	primary dysfunction after kidney transplant	1176	1290	α-MSH treatment reduced urine flow and impaired recovery of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to controls.
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)	control group	short-term graft function	1625	1780	in a porcine experimental model α-MSH did not reduce renal inflammation and did not improve short-term graft function following DBD kidney transplantation.
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)	control group	primary dysfunction after kidney transplant	15523	15693	At ten hours post-reperfusion, GFR of α-MSH treated animals was significantly lower compared to controls (Figure 3B; 8.2±5.7−13.3 ml/min vs. 14.3±10.1−19 ml/min; p<0.05).
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)	control group	inflammation after kidney transplant	1409	1465	α-MSH did not affect expression of inflammatory markers.
α-MSH	controls	Urine flow	-1	-1	Urine flow was significantly lower in the α-MSH group compared to controls during ten hours follow-up.
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)	control group	short-term graft function	1619	1780	Thus, in a porcine experimental model α-MSH did not reduce renal inflammation and did not improve short-term graft function following DBD kidney transplantation.
