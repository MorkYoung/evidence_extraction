consumed 200 ml/day of probiotic soy milk containing Lactobacillus planetarium A7 for 8 weeks	consumed 200 ml/day of soy milk for 8 weeks	systolic and diastolic BP	1357	1550	Although soy milk did not have any effect on BP, probiotic soymilk significantly decreased systolic (14.7 ± 0.48 vs. 13.05 ± 0.16, P = 0.001) and diastolic BP (10 ± 0.7 vs. 9.1 ± 1, P = 0.031).
consumed 200 ml/day of probiotic soy milk containing Lactobacillus planetarium A7 for 8 weeks	consumed 200 ml/day of soy milk for 8 weeks	BMI and waist to hip ratio	13229	13661	There were not any significant differences in terms of BMI (P = 0.920) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) (P = 0.610) at the beginning of study between two groups, but after intervention in probiotic soy milk a significant within group reduction was found in BMI (P < 0.010) and WHR (P < 0.050). But we did not find a significant difference between two groups after adjusting by baseline values, confounding factors with ANCOVA (Table 3).
consumed 200 ml/day of probiotic soy milk containing Lactobacillus planetarium A7 for 8 weeks	consumed 200 ml/day of soy milk for 8 weeks	systolic and diastolic BP	13795	14103	However, probiotic soy milk significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P < 0.050) even after adjusting by cofounding factors and baseline values with ANCOVA (P < 0.001), but systolic and diastolic BP didn't show any significant changes in soy milk group (P = 0.120 and 0.670, respectively).
consumed 200 ml/day of probiotic soy milk containing Lactobacillus planetarium A7 for 8 weeks	consumed 200 ml/day of soy milk for 8 weeks	BMI and waist to hip ratio	1141	1356	we failed to find any significant changes between probiotic soy milk and soy milk in term of body mass index (26.65 ± 0.68 vs. 26.33 ± 0.74, P = 0.300) and waist to hip ratio (1.49 ± 0.08 vs. 1.54 ± 0.1, P = 0.170).
