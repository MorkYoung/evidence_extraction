Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Heart rate	798	931	Participants ran farther, and with higher HRs, with self-selected entertainment compared to the two nature-based environment designs.
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Anxiety levels	19512	19711	There was no main effect of designs on reported feelings of anxiety, F (2, 58) = 0.190, p > 0.05, ƞp2 = 0.047, which showed that participants reported a similar level of anxiety across three designs.
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Happiness	1064	1173	Happiness increased during the two nature-based environment designs compared with self-selected entertainment
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Feeling of anger	20740	20933	There was no main effect for condition on reported feelings of anger, F (2, 58) = 0.190, p > 0.05, ƞp2 = 0.047, which indicated that people report a similar level of anger across three designs.
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Anxiety levels	932	1062	Participants attained lowered anger, dejection, anxiety and increased excitement post exercise in all of the designed environments
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Heart rate	17692	17918	Participants exercising with self-selected entertainment (Mdn = 149.11 bmp) achieved a higher HR than in the dynamic image condition (Mdn = 140.52 bmp, p < 0.05), and in the static image condition (Mdn = 142.03 bmp, p < 0.05).
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Distance ran	17371	17621	Distance run was influenced by the designs, F (29) = 10.572, p < 0.05, pƞ2 = 0.2 with participants in the self-selected entertainment condition (3066.8 ± 688.5 m) running longer distances than the static image condition (2767.2 ± 662.6 m) (p < 0.05).
Self-selected entertainment	Nature-based images	Happiness	18835	19080	The post hoc analysis indicated that participants felt happier in the dynamic image condition (1.958 ± 0.114), p < 0.05 and in the static image condition (1.987 ± 0.147), p < 0.05, than in the self-selected entertainment condition (1.713 ± 0.142
