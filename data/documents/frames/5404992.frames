Starting Early support group	Control	Ever practicing floor tummy time 	17315	17539	The intervention group was more likely to ever practice floor tummy time (40.7% vs. 24.1%, p<.001, OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.44–3.23) and to practice tummy time mostly on the floor (11.8% vs. 5.2%, p=.02, OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.20–4.98).
Starting Early support group	Control	Tummy time practice	17169	17303	The intervention group was more likely to practice tummy time (86.4% vs. 78.9%, p=.04, OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04–2.80) compared to controls

Starting Early support group	Control	Tummy time practice	17169	17314	The intervention group was more likely to practice tummy time (86.4% vs. 78.9%, p=.04, OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04–2.80) compared to controls (Table 4).
Starting Early support group	Control	Use of an infant car seat when not traveling	17960	18163	. Use of individual movement restricting devices was not different except for less use of an infant car seat when not traveling among intervention mothers (9.5% vs. 16.4%, p=.04, OR .54, 95% CI .30–.95).
Starting Early support group	Control	Ever practicing floor tummy time 	935	1380	Infant activity: 82.6% ever practiced tummy time; 32.0% practiced tummy time on the floor; 34.4% reported unrestrained floor time; 56.4% reported >1 hour/day in movement restricting devices. Inadequate health literacy was associated with reduced tummy time and unrestrained floor time. The intervention group reported more floor tummy time (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.44–3.23) and unrestrained floor time (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14–2.49) compared to controls.
Starting Early support group	Control	Practicing tummy time mostly on the floor	892	1380	456 mothers completed 3-month assessments. Infant activity: 82.6% ever practiced tummy time; 32.0% practiced tummy time on the floor; 34.4% reported unrestrained floor time; 56.4% reported >1 hour/day in movement restricting devices. Inadequate health literacy was associated with reduced tummy time and unrestrained floor time. The intervention group reported more floor tummy time (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.44–3.23) and unrestrained floor time (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14–2.49) compared to controls.
Starting Early support group	Control	Overall time in movement restricted devices	17833	17950	No differences were found between the intervention and control groups for overall time in movement restricted devices
Starting Early support group	Control	Use of an infant car seat when not traveling	17962	18163	Use of individual movement restricting devices was not different except for less use of an infant car seat when not traveling among intervention mothers (9.5% vs. 16.4%, p=.04, OR .54, 95% CI .30–.95).
