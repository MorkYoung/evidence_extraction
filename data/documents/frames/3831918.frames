pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 70 mmHg	pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 0 mmHg	pulse wave velocit (PWV), elastic modulus (Ep), forward expansion wave that decelerates flow and reduces pressure (W2), negative area (NA), and (RC) reflection coefficient 	18617	18805	Post hoc pair-wise comparisons revealed significantly higher values for these parameters during the 70-mmHg compression condition compared with the 0-mmHg compression condition (P < 0.05).
pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 70 mmHg	pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 0 mmHg	retrograde shear	1202	1300	Cuff inflation resulted in stepwise increases in retrograde shear rate (P < 0.05 for main effect).

pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 70 mmHg	pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 0 mmHg	retrograde shear	16949	17124	There were significant differences in retrograde shear rate, diastolic antegrade shear rate, and consequently mean shear rate across conditions (Table 3 and Fig. 1, P < 0.05).
pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 70 mmHg	pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 0 mmHg	diastolic antegrade and mean shear	17306	17466	whereas diastolic antegrade and mean shear were lower during the 70-mmHg compression condition compared to the 0-mmHg compression condition (Table 3, P < 0.05).
