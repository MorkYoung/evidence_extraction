95 dB sound	65 dB sound	Rate of error	1667	1739	increase in sound pressure level increased the rate of error (P < 0.05).
20 min exposure time	40 min exposure time	Rate of error	14094	14259	In calculating the rate of errors in the test for co-ordination of the hands with increase in the exposure time, no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05),
20 min exposure time	40 min exposure time	Rate of error	14094	14258	In calculating the rate of errors in the test for co-ordination of the hands with increase in the exposure time, no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05)
95 dB sound	65 dB sound	Rate of error	1661	1739	Also, increase in sound pressure level increased the rate of error (P < 0.05).
95 dB sound	65 dB sound	Speed of work	1311	1452	The results of this study showed that increasing sound pressure level from 65 to 95 dB in network 'A' increased the speed of work (P < 0.05).
