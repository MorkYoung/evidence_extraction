Bupivacaine (Group I)	Bupivacaine plus buprenorphine (Group II)	Analgesia duration	1409	1491	Median duration of analgesia was 16 h in group I and 20 h in group II (P = 0.002).
Bupivacaine (Group I)	Bupivacaine plus buprenorphine (Group II)	Visual Analog Score for post-operative pain	12161	12540	The pain scores, both VAS and DVAS, were low in both the groups; however, the number of analgesic demands and total analgesic consumed in group II was significantly low (P = 0.007). The AUC that represents the composite value for VAS and DVAS pain scores distributed over a period of 24 h was significantly low in group II, 9, than in group I (P = 0.047 and 0.017), respectively.
Bupivacaine (Group I)	Bupivacaine plus buprenorphine (Group II)	Demographic characteristics	1356	1408	Demographic data were comparable between the groups.
Bupivacaine (Group I)	Bupivacaine plus buprenorphine (Group II)	Analgesia duration	10392	10531	The median duration of analgesia was 16 (12–16) h in group I and 20 (16–24) h in group II (P = 0.002), which was statistically significant.
Bupivacaine (Group I)	Bupivacaine plus buprenorphine (Group II)	Visual Analog Score for post-operative pain	1492	1562	The maximum median VAS was 4 in group I and 2 in group II (P = 0.002).
