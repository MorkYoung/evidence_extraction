Baduanjin exercise	control	the results of sit-and-reach test	853	1031	By comparing the physical fitness indices, it was found that the increase of the results of sit-and-reach test in the intervention group had statistical significance (P = 0.001).
Baduanjin exercise	control	skinfold thicknesses at lower corner of scapula, triceps brachii, and abdomen,	660	852	Compared with the control group, the skinfold thicknesses decreased at lower corner of scapula, triceps brachii, and abdomen, with a statistical significance (P < 0.001; P = 0.005; P = 0.003).
Baduanjin exercise	control	the body weight and body mass index (BMI)	16383	16547	Compared with the control group, the body weight and body mass index (BMI) dropped in the intervention group, but the difference was of no statistical significance.
Baduanjin exercise	control	the results of sit-and-reach test	16752	17085	By comparing the physical fitness indices of the subjects, it was found that the results of sit-and-reach test in the intervention group were increased significantly. However, the control group showed no such changes. The increase of the results of sit-and-reach test in the intervention group had statistical significance (Table 6).
