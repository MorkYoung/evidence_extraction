received intraoperative application of a fibrin sealant following inguino-femoral lymph node dissection	received only inguino-femoral lymph node dissection	the time to drain removal	1035	1244	Thirty patients were then randomized; the median time to drain removal in the control group (n = 14) was 30 days (range, 13–74) compared to 29 days (range, 11–45) in the fibrin sealant group (n = 16; P = 0.6).
received intraoperative application of a fibrin sealant following inguino-femoral lymph node dissection	received only inguino-femoral lymph node dissection	the time to drain removal	19071	19348	Postoperatively, there was no statistically significant difference in the time to drain removal between the two groups: the fibrin sealant group required drains for a median of 31 days (range, 11–45 days), compared to 26 days (range, 13–74 days) in the control group (P = 0.6).
