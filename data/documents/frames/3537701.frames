continuous US (1 MHz &1.5 W/cm2) plus exercise	placebo US plus exercise	Lumbar range of motion (ROM) as well as holding time during the Sorensen test and median frequency slope of all measured paravertebral muscles 	1761	1941	Lumbar ROM as well as holding time during the Sorensen test and median frequency slope of all measured paravertebral muscles did not change significantly in either group (P > .05).
continuous US (1 MHz &1.5 W/cm2) plus exercise , placebo US plus exercise	baseline	functional disability, measured by Functional Rating Index	1656	1760	Analysis showed that both groups had improved regarding function (FRI) and global pain (VAS) (P < .001).
continuous US (1 MHz &1.5 W/cm2) plus exercise , placebo US plus exercise	baseline	functional disability, measured by Functional Rating Index	22460	22642	Bonferroni post-hoc test revealed that FRI scores had improved significantly after 10 treatment sessions (p < .001) and over time after one month follow-up in both groups (p < .001).
continuous US (1 MHz &1.5 W/cm2) plus exercise	placebo US plus exercise	Improvement in function and lumbar ROM as well as endurance time	1942	2081	Improvement in function and lumbar ROM as well as endurance time were significantly greater in the group receiving continuous US (P < .05).
