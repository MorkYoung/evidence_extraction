Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)	control	The elasticity of the major vessels, i.e., the movement of vessel wall between the systole and diastole, as well as blood velocity within these vessels	-1	-1	The elasticity of the major vessels, i.e., the movement of vessel wall between the systole and diastole, as well as blood velocity within these vessels were significantly better in CKD mice treated with HCQ. *P < 0.05 compared with CKD placebo mice.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)	control	aorta wall thicknesses	15371	15573	The vessel wall thickness was significantly lower among mice treated with HCQ compared to those that were not treated with HCQ (Fig 2), both in mice with normal renal function as well as those with CKD.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)	control	aorta wall thicknesses	1277	1425	HCQ reduced the area of aortic atherosclerosis on en face examination by approximately 60% in HCQ treated groups compared to the non-treated groups.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)	control	aorta wall thicknesses	1171	1276	Therapy with HCQ significantly reduced the severity of atherosclerosis in CKD mice and sham treated mice.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)	control	aorta wall thicknesses	14991	15248	We also measured the vascular wall thickness at pre-specified locations at their origin through the M-mode echo examination on AUE at the aortic arch and branching of major vessels (e.g. common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and innominate artery).
