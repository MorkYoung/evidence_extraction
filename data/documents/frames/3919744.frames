Exercises with whole-body vibration (Group I)	Exercises with whole-body vibration (Groups II and III) 	Amplitude parameters	13085	13602	To establish the impacts of different vibration frequency and amplitude parameters, test groups I-III were compared with each other. The Mann Whitney U test did not show a significant influence of vibration frequency and amplitude on the path length of the COP and rambling and trembling paths (p>0.05) between the pre-test measurements and those made directly after the first session of whole-body vibration, immediately after the last set of exercises of the 4-week whole-body vibration training and one week after.
