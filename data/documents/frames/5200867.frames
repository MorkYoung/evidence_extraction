Hidden X suture 	Crossed mattress suture	Keratinized tissue amount	1567	1751	It was demonstrated that the amount of keratinized tissue (KT) preserved on the buccal side was significantly greater in the hidden X suture group 4 months after the procedure (P<0.05)

Hidden X suture 	Crossed mattress suture	Mucogingival junction pushing to buccal side	14880	15182	The MGJ line shifted to the lingual side immediately after the application of the X suture by 1.56±0.90 mm, while the application of the hidden X suture slightly pushed the MGJ line to the buccal side by 0.25±0.66 mm (Table 2). The difference between the groups was statistically significant (P=0.003).
Hidden X suture 	Crossed mattress suture	Keratinized tissue amount	1593	1752	he amount of keratinized tissue (KT) preserved on the buccal side was significantly greater in the hidden X suture group 4 months after the procedure (P<0.05).

Hidden X suture 	Crossed mattress suture	Keratinized tissue width reduction	15183	15400	At 4 months, the width of the facial KT decreased in comparison to before the placement of sutures in both groups, but this reduction was different between the 2 groups to a statistically significant extent (P=0.007).
