Transbond XT self-etching primer + direct illumination	Control	Microleakage at gingival vs incisal margin	1036	1349	All groups showed greater microleakage at the gingival in comparison to the incisal margin and the differences were significant among groups with transillumination (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed in the microleakage scores at the gingival and incisal margins in any of the interfaces (P>0.05).
Transbond XT self-etching primer + transillumination.	Control	Microleakage at gingival vs incisal margin	1036	1210	All groups showed greater microleakage at the gingival in comparison to the incisal margin and the differences were significant among groups with transillumination (P<0.001).
Transbond XT self-etching primer + transillumination.	Control	Microleakage at gingival vs incisal margin	12486	12744	All groups showed microleakage at the incisal and gingival margins; but in comparison between conventional and transillumination groups, significant differences were observed only between incisal and gingival margins in the transillumination group (P<0.001).
Acid etching + Transbond XT primer + transillumination	Control	Microleakage at gingival vs incisal margin	1036	1210	All groups showed greater microleakage at the gingival in comparison to the incisal margin and the differences were significant among groups with transillumination (P<0.001).
Acid etching + Transbond XT primer + transillumination	Control	Microleakage at gingival vs incisal margin	12859	13165	When direct illumination and transillumination were compared as the two methods of curing, the amount of microleakage was significantly higher at the gingival margins compared to the incisal margins in both interfaces in the transillumination group irrespective of the method of enamel preparation (P<0.05)
