Dexmedetomidine	Normal saline (control group)	Scores of visual space, executive function, attention, and delayed memory	1703	1985	both MoCA and ANT results revealed that the visual space and executive function scores, attention scores, delayed memory scores, targeted network efficiency and executive control network efficiency in dexmedetomidine group were obviously higher than those in control group (P<0.01).
Dexmedetomidine	Normal saline (control group)	Targeted network efficiency and control network efficiency	12069	12347	The targeted network efficiency and control network efficiency in control group and dexmedetomidine group were obviously decreased compared with those in normal group (P<0.01), and they were obviously higher in dexmedetomidine group than those in control group (P<0.01, P<0.05).
Dexmedetomidine	Normal saline (control group)	Levels of NGF	1326	1440	The concentrations of serum S100B and NGF in dexmedetomidine group was lower than those in control group (P<0.01).
Dexmedetomidine	Normal saline (control group)	Levels of BDNF	1441	1693	The results of western blotting showed that the levels of serum BDNF in control group and dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than that in normal group (P<0.01), and it was higher in dexmedetomidine group than that in control group (P<0.01).
