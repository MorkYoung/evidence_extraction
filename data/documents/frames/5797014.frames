three-tumor marker classifier	CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 alone	the prognostic value of CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4 combined on gastric cancer	2493	2655	As demonstrated in previous literature, when used as a combination, these markers had the ability to increase the sensitivity and accuracy for survival prediction
three-tumor marker classifier	CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 alone	the prognostic value of CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4 combined on gastric cancer	9694	9915	Surprisingly, the AUCs of the three-marker classifier were 0.618 (p<0.001; 95% CI: 0.577, 0.658 for Training set) and 0.625 (p<0.001; 95% CI: 0.584, 0.666 for Validation), higher than any other individuals or combinations
