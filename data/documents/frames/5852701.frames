Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Appetite score	14733	14950	Average appetite scores across each day and for each intervention (SITcombine and RABcombine) are shown in Figure 3. Regular activity breaks did not significantly change appetite response compared to prolonged sitting
Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Appetite area under the curve at day 2	1099	1284	Appetite AUC did not differ between interventions (standardised effect of RAB compared to SIT: Day 1: 0.11; 95% CI: −0.28, 0.06; p = 0.212; Day 2: 0.04; 95% CI: −0.15, 0.24; p = 0.648).
Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Appetite area under the curve at day 2	1097	1284	. Appetite AUC did not differ between interventions (standardised effect of RAB compared to SIT: Day 1: 0.11; 95% CI: −0.28, 0.06; p = 0.212; Day 2: 0.04; 95% CI: −0.15, 0.24; p = 0.648).
Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Appetite score	15311	15495	The mean appetite score prior to the ad libitum lunch, and the mean change in appetite scores before and after the ad libitum lunch, did not significantly differ between interventions.
Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Appetite area under the curve at day 1	1099	1284	Appetite AUC did not differ between interventions (standardised effect of RAB compared to SIT: Day 1: 0.11; 95% CI: −0.28, 0.06; p = 0.212; Day 2: 0.04; 95% CI: −0.15, 0.24; p = 0.648).
Regular activity breaks	Prolonged sitting	Food consumed 	15118	15299	Quantity of food consumed at the ad libitum meal at the end of Day 2 did not differ significantly between RABcombine and SITcombine (mean difference 17 g; 95%CI: −12, 46; p = 0.253)
