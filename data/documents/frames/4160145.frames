Dosing titration IGF0T	Conventional dosing	Dose-sparing for idiopathic short stature	9874	10233	Among the three different treatment groups, the respective mean ± SE values for the ΔHSDS/GH dose ratios in GHD and ISS children were highest in the IGF0T group (48·1 ± 4·4 and 32·5 ± 2·8, respectively), with significant differences compared to both the conventional dosing group (30·3 ± 6·6 and 21·3 ± 3·5, respectively; P = 0·02 and P = 0·005, respectively)
Dosing titration IGF0T	IGF-I target of +2 SDs	Dose-sparing for GH deficiency	1309	1665	GH dosing titrated to an IGF-I target of 0 SDS was the most dose-sparing treatment regimen for GHD or ISS children (mean±SE ΔHSDS/GH dose ratios 48·1 ± 4·4 and 32·5 ± 2·8, respectively) compared with conventional dosing (30·3 ± 6·6 and 21·3 ± 3·5, respectively; P = 0·02, P = 0·005) and IGF2T (32·7 ± 4·8 and 16·3 ± 2·8, respectively; P = 0·02, P < 0·0001)
Dosing titration IGF0T	Conventional dosing	Dose-sparing for GH deficiency	8737	8952	The respective mean ± SE values for ΔHSDS in GHD and ISS children were significantly greater for the IGF2T group than for the IGF0T (P < 0·001) and conventional dosing groups (P = 0·001 and P < 0·001, respectively).
