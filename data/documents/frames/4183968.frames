Weight-loss intervention	Control group	Hyperactivation of the reward system for high-calorie food cues	841	1260	Compared to controls, intervention participants achieved significant weight loss (−6.3±1.0 kg versus +2.1±1.1 kg, P<0.001) and had increased activation for LC food images with a composition consistent with that recommended in the behavioral intervention at 6 months versus baseline in the right ventral putamen (P=0.04), decreased activation for HC images of typically consumed foods in the left dorsal putamen (P=0.01)
Weight-loss intervention	Control group	Loss of weight	841	963	Compared to controls, intervention participants achieved significant weight loss (−6.3±1.0 kg versus +2.1±1.1 kg, P<0.001)
Weight-loss intervention	Control group	Hyperactivation of the reward system for low-calorie food cues	20687	20867	However, in contrast to that study, which showed only a decrease in activation for HC foods, our intervention participants also had an absolute increase in activation for LC foods.
Weight-loss intervention	Control group	Loss of weight	15870	16012	Subjects randomized to the behavioral intervention achieved significant weight loss versus controls (−6.3±1.0 kg versus +2.1±1.1 kg, P<0.001).
