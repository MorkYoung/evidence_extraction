a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	caregiving self‐efficacy	-1	-1	Univariate tests revealed a significant time‐by‐condition interaction for SE‐Respite scores (F(1, 64) = 4.43, p ≤ .05, ηp 2 = .07) and that approached significance for SE‐Behavior Management scores (F(1, 64) = 3.61, p = .06, ηp 2 = .05), with relatively greater increases in caregiving self‐efficacy at post‐intervention for participants in the behavioral coaching condition.
a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	Upset following behavior problems	23588	23844	The multivariate Condition × Time statistic was significant (Wilk's F(1, 63) = 4.29, p ≤ .05, ηp <NEWLINE>2 = .06) with greater post‐intervention reductions in upset for participants in the behavioral coaching condition; Cohen's d = 0.50 represents a medium effect.
a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	caregiving self‐efficacy	1365	1520	Caregiving self‐efficacy scores for obtaining respite and for managing patient behavioral disturbances were significantly higher in the coaching condition.
a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	negative mood and anxiety	-1	-1	Univariate tests revealed a significant time‐by‐condition interaction for Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Negative Affect scores (F(1, 64) = 6.92, p ≤ .05, ηp 2 = .10) and MAACL anxiety scores (F(1, 64) = 6.34, p ≤ .05, ηp 2 = .09), with lower levels of negative mood and anxiety at post‐intervention for participants in the behavioral coaching condition.
a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	Caregiving status	26017	26226	The two intervention conditions did not differ in caregiving status changes, either immediately post‐intervention (X <NEWLINE>2(2, N = 74) = 1.70, p = .43) or 6 months post‐intervention (X <NEWLINE>2(2, N = 73) = 0.22, p = .90)
a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation	baseline	Upset following behavior problems	1002	1250	For those providing in‐home care at post‐treatment, depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, and negative mood states were statistically lower in the behavioral coaching condition than in the basic education and support condition.
