Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	All responses, excluding 'watchful waiting'	-1	-1	Using a direct test for statistical interaction, only the outcome of "all responses other than 'watchful waiting'â€? had no statistical interaction to the year of the study (p = 0.86).
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year	2790	2888	, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	Generated alerts	26509	26604	No difference was observed between study generated alerts and those generated by their systems.
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	All responses, excluding 'watchful waiting'	28202	28339	However, when the term for "watchful waiting" is excluded from public health response, the results were not significant (Table 5).Table 5
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	Alert response during the first year	27129	27290	The effect of the intervention was more pronounced in year 1 with large LPHAs in the intervention group showing fewer responses to the alerts than control LPHAs.
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	Generated alerts	2693	2888	Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process, no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1.
Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol	Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes	Alert response during the first year	29691	29969	Our intervention significantly decreased the number of responses in intervention versus control LPHAs in the first year but less in the second year of the study. In the first year, the intervention LPHAs were significantly less likely to report the findings to external agencies
