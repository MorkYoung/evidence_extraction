Flush frequency every 24 hours	Flush frequency every 6 hours	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	1108	1269	PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were also not significantly different for the frequency intervention (5.06 [24 hour] versus 7.34 [6 hour], p = 0.05, log-rank).
Flush frequency every 24 hours	Flush frequency every 6 hours	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	-1	-1	The incidence rate of PIVC failure in patients assigned to 24 hour flushing was 5.1 per 1000 hours compared with 7.3 per 1000 hours in those assigned to 6 hour flushing (p = 0.054, log-rank, Table 2 and Fig. 2).
0.9 % sodium chloride 10 mL flush	0.9 % sodium chloride 3 mL flush	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	958	1269	PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were not significantly different for the volume intervention (4.84 [3 mL] versus 7.44 [10 mL], p = 0.06, log-rank). PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were also not significantly different for the frequency intervention (5.06 [24 hour] versus 7.34 [6 hour], p = 0.05, log-rank).
Flush frequency	Flush volume	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	-1	-1	There was no significant interaction between the two study interventions (p = 0.21, Cox, Table 3); i.e. the results for comparison of the two volumes were not affected by the frequency, and the results for comparison between the two frequencies were also not affected by the volume.
Flush frequency every 24 hours	Flush frequency every 6 hours	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	15832	15968	The overall PIVC failure rate was 46 % or 6.13/1000 device hours, with occlusion and phlebitis the most common reasons for PIVC failure.
Flush frequency	Flush volume	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	925	1269	PIVC average dwell was 3.1 days. PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were not significantly different for the volume intervention (4.84 [3 mL] versus 7.44 [10 mL], p = 0.06, log-rank). PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were also not significantly different for the frequency intervention (5.06 [24 hour] versus 7.34 [6 hour], p = 0.05, log-rank).
0.9 % sodium chloride 10 mL flush	0.9 % sodium chloride 3 mL flush	Peripheral intravenous catheter failure rates per 1000 hours	958	1107	PIVC failure rates per 1000 hours were not significantly different for the volume intervention (4.84 [3 mL] versus 7.44 [10 mL], p = 0.06, log-rank).
