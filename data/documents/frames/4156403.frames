Randomized CT scan	Control	PLCO thyroid cancer risk in men	1586	1805	In PLCO, randomization to cancer screening compared with usual care was associated with a significant decrease in thyroid cancer risk for men (HR  = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49–0.95) but not women (HR  = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66–1.26)
Randomized CT scan	Control	PLCO thyroid cancer risk in women	1586	1806	In PLCO, randomization to cancer screening compared with usual care was associated with a significant decrease in thyroid cancer risk for men (HR  = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49–0.95) but not women (HR  = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66–1.26).

Randomized CT scan	Control	NLST thyroid cancer risk	16619	16745	We observed a non-significant increase (HR  = 1.61; 95% CI: 0.96–2.71) in thyroid cancer risk for the intervention arm in NLST
Randomized CT scan	Control	NLST thyroid cancer risk	1239	1380	In NLST, randomization to lung CT scan was associated with a non-significant increase in thyroid cancer risk (HR  = 1.61; 95% CI: 0.96–2.71).
