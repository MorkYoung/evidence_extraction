Home-based approach	Hospital-based approach	Waiting time	18377	18642	The waiting time of patients with AHI ≥ 15/hr who were started on CPAP treatment from the first clinic consultation to the diagnostic sleep test, autoCPAP titration, and CPAP treatment was 189.6, 148.8 and 145.0 days shorter in group A than in group B respectively.
Home-based approach	Hospital-based approach	Waiting time	1191	1615	The waiting time of patients with AHI ≥ 15/hr who were started on CPAP treatment from the first clinic consultation to the diagnostic sleep test, autoCPAP titration, and CPAP treatment was 189.6, 148.8 and 145.0 days shorter in group A than group B respectively. Home-based approach is non-inferior to hospital-based approach in managing patients with suspected OSAS, with shorter waiting time, and substantial cost savings.
Home-based approach	Hospital-based approach	Waiting time	18643	18874	The much longer waiting time for PSG and autoCPAP titration in the hospital setting was due to the limited number of hospital beds designated for sleep medicine service whereas the home-based approach offered much more flexibility.
Home-based approach	Hospital-based approach	Mean costs per patient	16971	17239	Following modified ITT analysis, the mean (SD) costs for the patients in group A (n = 86) and group B (n = 86) were HK$8479 (989) and HK$22,248 (2407) respectively. The mean difference between groups was HK$-13,769 per patient with 95% CI. (−14324, −13213), p < 0.001.
Home-based approach	Hospital-based approach	Mean costs per patient	959	1190	The mean costs for the patients in group A and group B were HK$8479(989) and HK$22,248(2407) respectively. The mean difference between groups was HK$-13,769(USD 1770 equivalent) per patient with 95% CI. (−14324, −13213), p < 0.001.
