dulaglutide (1.5 or 0.75 mg)	sitagliptin 100 mg	Gastrointestinal adverse events	1469	1662	Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with dulaglutide 1.5 and 0.75 mg versus sitagliptin (nausea 17 and 15% vs 7%, diarrhoea 16 and 12% vs 6%, vomiting 14 and 8% vs 4% respectively)
dulaglutide (1.5 or 0.75 mg)	sitagliptin 100 mg	mean HbA1c changes	15815	16098	The LS mean HbA1c changes were superior with dulaglutide 1.5 mg [LS mean difference (95% confidence interval) −0.67% (−0.84, −0.50) or −7.32 mmol/mol (−9.18, −5.47)] and dulaglutide 0.75 mg [−0.39% (−0.56, −0.22) or −4.26 mmol/mol (−6.12, −2.40)] versus sitagliptin (p < 0.001, both)
dulaglutide (1.5 or 0.75 mg)	sitagliptin 100 mg	decrease from baseline in mean fasting plasma glucose concentration	17338	17634	The decrease from baseline in mean fasting plasma glucose concentration was significantly greater in both dulaglutide arms throughout the 104‐week treatment period and at final endpoint (104 week LS mean ± s.e.: −2.0 ± 0.2, −1.4 ± 0.2, and −0.5 ± 0.2 mmol/l, respectively; p < 0.001) (Figure 2D).
