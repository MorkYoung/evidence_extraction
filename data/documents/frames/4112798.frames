Erlotinib 	Placebo 	Neurological progression-free survival	1123	1208	Median nPFS was 1.6 months in both arms; nPFS HR 0.95 (95% CI = 0.59 to1.54; P = .84)
Erlotinib 	Placebo 	Overall survival	1210	1338	Median overall survival (OS) was 2.9 and 3.4 months in the placebo and erlotinib arms; HR 0.95 (95% CI = 0.58 to 1.55; P = .83).
Erlotinib 	Placebo 	Grade 3/4 adverse event 	1502	1588	Grade 3/4 adverse event rates were similar between the two groups (70.0% in each arm),
Erlotinib 	Placebo 	Grade 3/4 adverse event 	1502	1587	Grade 3/4 adverse event rates were similar between the two groups (70.0% in each arm)
Erlotinib 	Placebo 	Neurological progression-free survival	14427	14619	The unadjusted HR for neurological PFS was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.62 to1.58; P = .97), which became 0.95 (95% CI = 0.59 to 1.54; P = .84) after allowing for the randomization stratification factors.
