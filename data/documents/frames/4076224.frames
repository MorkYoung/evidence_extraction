Risk assessment 	Risk assessment + a nasal flow monitor	Risk of being identified with any sleep disorder		22966	23204	The RA+ group (79%, 136/173) had a significantly higher rate of being identified as being 'at risk' of having any sleep disorder and being referred as per protocol compared to the RAO group (54%, 82/152, OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.7–6.3 p<0.0001).

Risk assessment 	Risk assessment + a nasal flow monitor	Risk of obstructive sleep apnea	1340	1520	The proportion of screened participants identified as being at risk of OSA was significantly higher in the RA+ group (36% in RAO vs. 66% in RA+, OR 3.4, 95% CI (1.8–6.5), p<0.001).
