stainless steel posts	Cast metal post - control group	mean load	8071	8195	The difference in mean load between cast metal and stainless steel was also found to be statistically significant (P < 0.01)
carbon fiber post	Cast metal post - control group	mean load	7494	7660	From the results of the analysis, we observe that there was a significant difference between the posts with respect to the mean load (F = 20.34, P < 0.001) [Table 1].
all the prefabricated posts	Cast metal post - control group	bond strength	1244	1349	The bond strength of all the prefabricated posts was significantly lower than the conventional cast post.
prefabricated stainless steel post	carbon fiber posts, glass fiber posts	Among the prefabricated posts highest bond strength	1244	1348	The bond strength of all the prefabricated posts was significantly lower than the conventional cast post
glass fiber posts	Cast metal post - control group	mean load	7896	8069	A highly significant difference in the mean load between cast metal and carbon fiber (P < 0.001) as well as between cast metal and glass fiber posts (P < 0.001) was observed
prefabricated stainless steel post	carbon fiber posts, glass fiber posts	Among the prefabricated posts highest bond strength	1350	1601	Among the prefabricated posts highest bond strength was obtained for prefabricated stainless steel post and lowest for carbon fiber posts. There was no significant difference in the mean bond strength obtained for stainless steel and glass fiber post.
carbon fiber post	Cast metal post - control group	mean load	7896	8196	A highly significant difference in the mean load between cast metal and carbon fiber (P < 0.001) as well as between cast metal and glass fiber posts (P < 0.001) was observed. The difference in mean load between cast metal and stainless steel was also found to be statistically significant (P < 0.01).
