Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo 	Baseline characteristics	16269	16439	There were no baseline differences between the children who had received neonatal VAS or placebo, continued to live in the study area and were met at follow-up (Table 1).
Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo	Mortality rates in children who did not receive FU-VAS	21283	21450	Neonatal VAS versus placebo had no significant effect on mortality in the second and third year of life in children who had received no FU-VAS (group C versus group D)
Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo	Mortality rates after FU-VAS	18647	18824	After FU-VAS, mortality was significantly lower for children who had received neonatal VAS (group A) than for children who had received placebo (group B) (MRR: 0.54 (0.31–0.94))
Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo	Mortality rates after FU-VAS	18647	18845	After FU-VAS, mortality was significantly lower for children who had received neonatal VAS (group A) than for children who had received placebo (group B) (MRR: 0.54 (0.31–0.94)) (Table 2, Figure 2).
Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo	Mortality rates in children who did not receive FU-VAS	1416	1572	Among children who had not received FU-VAS, mortality in the second and third year of life did not differ according to reception of neonatal VAS or placebo.
Vitamin A supplementation (VAS)	Placebo 	Baseline characteristics	16269	16639	There were no baseline differences between the children who had received neonatal VAS or placebo, continued to live in the study area and were met at follow-up (Table 1). There were no differences between the children met at follow-up (groups A and B) and those not met (parts of groups C and D) with regard to treatment, sex or anthropometric measurements at enrolment.
