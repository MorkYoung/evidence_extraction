Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio	15337	15433	The ratio between active MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (MMP-9/TIMP-1) was statistically lower in the BS group
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio	15337	15564	The ratio between active MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (MMP-9/TIMP-1) was statistically lower in the BS group (Figure 1). This was due to a lower plasmatic level of active MMP-9 and a higher plasmatic concentration of TIMP-1 in the BS group
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	IL-6	15226	15274	IL-6 and IL-8 increased similarly in both groups
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	Bicarbonate 	17008	17070	HCO3 - and BE valves were significantly lower in the UBS group
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin	17286	17398	the NGAL urinary concentration in the BS group were statistically lower compared to the value found in UBS group
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	IL-10	1571	1670	The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	IL-6	15226	15325	IL-6 and IL-8 increased similarly in both groups (Table 3), whilst IL-10 was higher in the BS group
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	IL-8	15226	15274	IL-6 and IL-8 increased similarly in both groups
Balanced solutions	Unbalanced solutions	IL-8	15226	15325	IL-6 and IL-8 increased similarly in both groups (Table 3), whilst IL-10 was higher in the BS group
