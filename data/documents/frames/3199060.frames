Motion-based controllers	Traditional controllers	Energy expenditure	537	810	An interaction was found such that in one pair, motion control (mean [SD] 0.96 [0.20] kcal · kg−1 · hr−1) produced 0.10 kcal · kg−1 · hr−1 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.17) greater energy expenditure than traditional control (0.86 [0.17] kcal · kg−1 · hr−1, P =  .048)
Motion-based controllers	Traditional controllers	Enjoyment by playing Resident evil	14387	14566	The motion-controlled Resident Evil game produced a 1.39 (95% CI 0.84–1.95) point higher enjoyment rating (on a scale of 1–7) than the traditionally controlled Resident Evil game.
Motion-based controllers	Traditional controllers	Baseline characteristics	12207	12294	There were no significant differences between groups on any sociodemographic variables.
