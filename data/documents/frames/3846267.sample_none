0	71	MMC	Acid	Percent incidence of dry cavity	Percent incidence of dry cavity for the MMC and Acid group was 8 and 6% respectively.
1	75	acetic acid	topical MMC	involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity	In the third phase of treatment of topical MMC only 7 patients (28%) had involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity and this is less than 25% involvement but the percentage of patients in acetic acid group that involved in more than 25% mastoid involvement was 17 patients (68%), which was again statistically signi- ficant (P<0.05).
2	75	acetic acid	topical MMC	mastoid involvement	In the third phase of treatment of topical MMC only 7 patients (28%) had involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity and this is less than 25% involvement but the percentage of patients in acetic acid group that involved in more than 25% mastoid involvement was 17 patients (68%), which was again statistically signi- ficant (P<0.05).
3	76	MMC	acetic acid	incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue	After three months of follow up, the final result of using topical MMC and acetic acid was evaluated and the incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue was 92% in MMC group whereas it was 24% in Acid group, which was statistically significant (P<0.05).
4	76	MMC	Acid	incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue	After three months of follow up, the final result of using topical MMC and acetic acid was evaluated and the incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue was 92% in MMC group whereas it was 24% in Acid group, which was statistically significant (P<0.05).
5	76	acetic acid	Acid	incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue	After three months of follow up, the final result of using topical MMC and acetic acid was evaluated and the incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue was 92% in MMC group whereas it was 24% in Acid group, which was statistically significant (P<0.05).
6	77	MMC	Acid	percentage of patients with 25 % involvement mastoid cavity with granulation	At the same time the percentage of patients with 25% involvement mastoid cavity with granulation was 8% in the MMC group (two patients) and 19 patients (76%) in Acid group, which was again statistically significant difference.
7	99	MMC	Acid acetic	number of patient with dry cavity	Although the number of patient with dry cavity with less than 25% was more in MMC group at third week of evaluation, but it was not statistically significant but in final evaluation it become 72% in compared to 20% in Acid acetic group that is statistically significant.
