patients with minimal-risk	remainder of the cohort	pre-test probability of obstructive CAD	9203	9479	In comparison with the remainder of the cohort, patients with minimal-risk were less likely to have symptoms of typical angina (24.1% vs 42.6%, p < 0.001) and had lower pre-test probability of obstructive CAD as determined from the CADC risk score (30.0% vs 47.0%, p < 0.001).
PROMISE minimal-risk tool	CADC model	discrimination	1266	1388	The PROMISE minimal-risk tool improved discrimination compared with the CADC model (c-statistic 0.785 vs 0.730, p < 0.001)
patients with minimal-risk	remainder of the cohort	symptoms of typical angina	9251	9357	patients with minimal-risk were less likely to have symptoms of typical angina (24.1% vs 42.6%, p < 0.001)
PROMISE minimal-risk tool	CADC model	discrimination	1266	1495	The PROMISE minimal-risk tool improved discrimination compared with the CADC model (c-statistic 0.785 vs 0.730, p < 0.001) and was improved further following re-estimation of covariate coefficients (c-statistic 0.805, p < 0.001).
PROMISE minimal-risk tool	CADC model	Goodness-of-fit	-1	-1	Goodness-of-fit was not demonstrated for either established CADC model (χ2 1010.1, HL p < 0.001) or the PROMISE minimal-risk risk tool (χ2 197.6, HL p < 0.001)
patients with minimal-risk	remainder of the cohort	symptoms of typical angina	9203	9357	In comparison with the remainder of the cohort, patients with minimal-risk were less likely to have symptoms of typical angina (24.1% vs 42.6%, p < 0.001)
