Kinesio taping 	Control	Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire improvement 	1268	1569	Pain intensity and RMDQ scores improved significantly in both groups at 5 days compared with baseline. Considering the degree of treatment effect (the change from baseline to day 5), the Kinesio taping group was significantly superior than the control group in all outcome measures (for all, P<0.001).
Kinesio taping 	Control	Pain intensity at rest	11034	11442	In both groups, all the outcome measures (pain intensity during rest, pain intensity during movement, and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) were significantly reduced at day 5 compared with baseline (for all P<0.001). Nevertheless, considering the change data from baseline to day 5, the Kinesio tape group was significantly superior than the control group in all the outcome measures (for all P<0.001)
