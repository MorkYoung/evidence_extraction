Head-middle (HM): the swimmer looked downward at 90 degrees to the swimming direction, in a neutral position. The swimmer's ears were covered by the forearms, which were fully extended over the head or Head-down (HD): the swimmer looked backwards, and his ears were below the forearms, which were fully extended over the head.	Head-up (HU): the swimmer looked directly forward, and his ears were above the forearms and fully extended over the head.	passive drag	12804	13004	Regarding the swimmer's head position, passive drag was found to be significantly lower in the LA condition (with the arms in front of the head) for the HD and HM than the HU at all speeds (Figure 2).
