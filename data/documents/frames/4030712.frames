Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation	Placebo	Serum 25(OH)D levels	11229	11370	Serum 25(OH)D levels increased markedly in both active treatment groups when compared to the placebo group across all kidney function groups.
Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation	Placebo	Serum 25(OH)D levels	11229	11369	Serum 25(OH)D levels increased markedly in both active treatment groups when compared to the placebo group across all kidney function groups
Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation	Placebo	Baseline characteristics (except age and intact PTH level)	10539	10997	At baseline, age and intact PTH level were the only two characteristics with significant differences across the 3-eGFR groups (as specified in Table 1). The remaining baseline characteristics, which included body mass index, daily calcium intake, daily vitamin D3 intake, serum calcium level, serum phosphorus level, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level, serum 25(OH)D level, and radius BMD, were not significantly different among the 3 eGFR groups
Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation	Placebo	Rate of bone mineral density loss	1052	1249	Analysis of variance demonstrated an overall treatment effect on distal radius BMD (p = 0.005), with the active treatment groups showing a lower rate of BMD loss when compared to the placebo group.
