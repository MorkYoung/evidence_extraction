The groups did not differ significantly in MADRS scores at either the one-week follow-up (F = 0.03 p = 0.87) or the one-month follow-up (F = 0.59 p = 0.45). At the six-month follow-up, there was a trend for the ultrabrief-pulse group to show lower depression scores relative to the brief-pulse group (F = 3.71, p = 0.07); however, data was only available for a subset of participants (n = 35).
