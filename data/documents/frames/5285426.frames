Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Sexual function scores in females	15728	15901	Overall, there was no statistical difference between the mean change of scores from baseline between the two groups in any of the FSF components or the FSF composite scores.
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Baseline rectal cancer diagnosis	12974	13040	patients in the robotic group had lower rectal cancers (p = 0.032)
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Sexual function scores in females	1295	1412	In females, there was no difference between the two groups in any of the components of urological or sexual function.
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Male sexual function scores	14156	14505	Mean scores deteriorated across all component of MSF in the laparoscopic group but none in the robotic group. Statistical comparison of the mean change of MSF scores from baseline revealed favourable outcomes for the robotic group across all four components of MSF as shown in Table 4. Composite MSF score change was also better in the robotic group
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Urological function scores in females	1295	1412	In females, there was no difference between the two groups in any of the components of urological or sexual function.
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Baseline rectal cancer diagnosis	12888	13165	The baseline characteristics of the two groups were broadly comparable. Nevertheless, patients in the robotic group had lower rectal cancers (p = 0.032) and were more likely to receive long-course pre-operative radiotherapy (p = 0.012) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.030).
Robotic surgery	Laparoscopic surgery	Male sexual function scores	1174	1294	Composite male urological and sexual function score changes from baseline were better in the robotic cohort (p < 0.001).
