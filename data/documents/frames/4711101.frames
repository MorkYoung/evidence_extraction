Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Blood loss 	1388	1552	Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group.
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Range of motion	16864	17009	No differences in range of motion between groups were found at the different time points (two-way ANOVA, F(1) = 0.73; p = 0.12) (Table 3).Table 3
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Rotational alignment of the femur	1702	1923	There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Flexion/extension of the femur	1702	2018	There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Range of motion	16864	16991	No differences in range of motion between groups were found at the different time points (two-way ANOVA, F(1) = 0.73; p = 0.12)
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Surgery time	1388	1552	Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group.
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Pain	1162	1302	Patients in the MIS group (3.97 ± 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 ± 1.43) p = 0.003
Mini-midvastus	Standard approach	Flexion/extension of the femur	1702	1923	There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component
