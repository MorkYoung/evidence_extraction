MSD, 100 mg l?dopa plus 25 mg carbidopa	placebo (starch)	The BP of the GABA ligand	9027	9280	The BP of the GABA ligand decreased significantly with l‐dopa in the medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate and right insula regions (by 18%, t = −3.63 P = 0.0054, and 18%, t = 3.85 P = 0039, respectively), with no significant effect in the other regions.
MSD, 100 mg l?dopa plus 25 mg carbidopa	placebo (starch)	mean decrease in [11C]Ro15?4513 BP	-1	-1	r. For a composite gray matter region, a one?sample t?test showed that l?dopa was associated with an 11% mean decrease in [11C]Ro15?4513 BP (t = ?2.29, 9 degrees of freedom, P = 0.048). There was a highly significant effect of regions (linear mixed model, P = 0.000049).
