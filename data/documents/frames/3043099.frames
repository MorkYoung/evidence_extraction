Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Glucose area under the curve	-1	-1	Glucose AUC was not different between ethnicities pre or post intervention and did not change after the intervention.
Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Insulin area under the curve	1211	1336	Pre intervention IAUC was 28% higher (p<0.05) in MA (IAUC pre  =  2298 μU*180 min/mL) than in NHW (IAUC = 1795 μU*180 min/mL)
Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Improvement in Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and small dense LDL particles concentrations	1621	1828	Plasma cholesterol and TG concentrations significantly improved in both groups, but concentrations of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and small dense LDL particles significantly improved only in the NHW.
Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Insulin area under the curve	1338	1555	Following the intervention, there was a significant reduction in IAUC in MA (29%) and NHW (32%), however, the IAUC remained higher (p<0.05) for MA (post  = 1635 μU*180 min/mL) than for NHW (post = 1211 μU*180 min/mL).
Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Improvement in Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and small dense LDL particles concentrations	1705	1828	concentrations of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and small dense LDL particles significantly improved only in the NHW.
Mexican Americans	NonHispanic whites	Glucose area under the curve	25083	25212	The pre-intervention IVGTT revealed no significant differences in glucose area under the curve between ethnic groups ( <NEWLINE>Figure 1 <NEWLINE>)
