120% LT and 80% LT	control	glucose level	922	1109	Glucose decreased 22.7 mg/dL (95%CI=10.3 to 35, P=0.001) at the 45 min post-exercise recovery period for 80%LT and decreased 31.2 mg/dL (95%CI=18.1 to 44.4, P<0.001) for 120%LT (P=0.004).
80%LT	control	insulin	20497	20848	t insulin decreased at the 15th and 45th min of post-exercise recovery in 80%LT (P=0.001) and CON (P≤0.04) compared to rest in the same session. Furthermore, the 80%LT session decreased more than CON at the 15th min of post-exercise recovery (P=0.03), and insulin decreased more at the 45th min in 80%LT (P=0.002) and 120%LT (P=0.004) compared to CON.
80%LT	control	insulin	20189	20847	Regarding insulin, the main effects of time (F(1.3, 12.8)=36.9, P<0.001, partial η2=0.79) and condition (F(2, 20)=7.8, P=0.003, partial η2=0.44) were significant. The condition × time interaction was also insignificant (F(2.2, 21.8)=1.6, P=0.223, partial η2=0.14). Bonferroni's post hoc analysis revealed that insulin decreased at the 15th and 45th min of post-exercise recovery in 80%LT (P=0.001) and CON (P≤0.04) compared to rest in the same session. Furthermore, the 80%LT session decreased more than CON at the 15th min of post-exercise recovery (P=0.03), and insulin decreased more at the 45th min in 80%LT (P=0.002) and 120%LT (P=0.004) compared to CON
120% LT and 80% LT	control	glucose level	765	1107	Both exercise sessions elicited a parallel decrease in glucose level during exercise (P≤0.002), with a greater decrease being observed for 120%LT (P=0.005). Glucose decreased 22.7 mg/dL (95%CI=10.3 to 35, P=0.001) at the 45 min post-exercise recovery period for 80%LT and decreased 31.2 mg/dL (95%CI=18.1 to 44.4, P<0.001) for 120%LT (P=0.004
80% LT	control	bradykinin	1188	1258	Bradykinin increased at 45 min post-exercise only for 80%LT (P=0.013),
