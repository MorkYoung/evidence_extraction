0	10	rifaximin	probiotic VSL # 3	prostatitis	Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP plus IBS.
1	57	rifaximin	VSL # 3	positive sperm culture	Table 2 Number and percentage (in parentheses) of patients with bacteriologically cured CBP who had a positive sperm culture after treatment with rifaximin (200 mg, 2 tablets bid for 7 days a month) and VSL#3 (450Ã—10 9  CFU per day) 
2	63	placebo - controlled	probiotic cocktail VSL # 3	bloating , flatulence , and colonic transit	Two separate placebo-controlled studies reported improvement in bloating, flatulence, and colonic transit in response to the probiotic cocktail VSL#3, which comprises eight different bacterial strains including Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.2930 An increase in the peripheral antiinflammatory (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-12) cytokine ratio was associated with probiotic administration and symptom improvement.31 In contrast, two other studies with Lactobacillus did not report any benefit.1415  In this study, performed on a selected group of patients with a clinical history positive for IBS and CBP cured with antibiotics and resulting in a bacteriological eradication, we evaluated the protective role of long-term treatment with rifaximin and VSL#3 on the evolution of prostatitis toward more complicated forms of MAGI.
