Add-on lithium	Placebo	Response rate improvement 	-1	-1	Between-group differences in response and remission rates were significant in favor of add-on lithium (p = 0.005, both).
Add-on lithium	Placebo	Clinical Global Impressions for Bipolar Disorder-Severity of Illness	15929	16121	Add-on lithium was associated with significantly greater LS mean reductions in CGI-BP-S (mean difference, −0.24, p = 0.017) and CGI-BP-C (mean difference, −0.20; p =0.020) than add-on placebo.
