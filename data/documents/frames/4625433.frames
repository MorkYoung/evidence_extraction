tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	Concentration of glycerol	1194	1264	, accumulation of lactate to 116 % and glycerol to 190 % was observed.
tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	Concentration of lactate	13766	13889	Concentration of lactate increased significantly during reperfusion of 30–60 min up to 116 % (3.9 ± 0.8 mmol/L; p < 0.001).
tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	L/P ratio	14329	14417	L/P ratio increased significantly 79 % (107 ± 33.3; p < 0.001) after period of ischemia,
tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	Concentration of glycerol	14068	14267	Concentration of glycerol also increased dramatically at beginning of reperfusion to 190 % (244.7 ± 12.5 μmol/L; p < 0.001) and stayed significant increased during 180 min of reperfusion (p < 0.001).
tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	Concentration of lactate	13766	13887	Concentration of lactate increased significantly during reperfusion of 30–60 min up to 116 % (3.9 ± 0.8 mmol/L; p < 0.001
tourniquet group	non-tourniquet group	L/P ratio	14329	14416	L/P ratio increased significantly 79 % (107 ± 33.3; p < 0.001) after period of ischemia
