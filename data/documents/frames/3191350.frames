High-maintenance demand training	Low-maintenance demand	Error rate	32038	32313	Although both groups (high and low demand) increased performance in posttest in contrast to the pretest, the high-maintenance demand trainings lead to significant less error rates in posttest compared to the low-maintenance demand trainings (F = 10.96, η2 = 0.06, p = 0.001).
High-maintenance demand training	Low-maintenance demand	Performance	31687	32037	The main effect of Maintenance demand F(1,168) = 4.90, MSE = 163.30, η2 = 0.03, p = 0.03 and its interaction with Session F(1,168) = 4.98, MSE = 65.67, η2 = 0.03, p = 0.03 reached significance, indicating performance improvement in the high-maintenance demand training group compared to the low-maintenance demand conditions from pretest to posttest.
High-maintenance demand training	Low-maintenance demand	Performance	39128	39313	High demand training in the switching component resulted in better performance improvement in posttest than training with low demand in this component (F = 10.39, η2 = 0.06, p = 0.002).
