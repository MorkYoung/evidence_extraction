Inravenous ertapenem, 1 g once a day	Intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam, 3.375 g every 6 hours	obstetric/postpartum infection or gynecologic/postoperative infection	922	1237	At the primary efficacy endpoint 2–4 weeks post therapy, 93.9% of patients <NEWLINE>who received ertapenem and 91.5% of those who received piperacillin–tazobactam were cured (95% <NEWLINE>confidence interval for the difference, adjusting for strata, –4% to 8.8%), indicating that cure rates for both <NEWLINE>treatment groups were equivalent.
Inravenous ertapenem, 1 g once a day	Intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam, 3.375 g every 6 hours	obstetric/postpartum infection or gynecologic/postoperative infection	-1	-1	In a multicenter, double-blind study, 412 women with acute pelvic infection were assigned to one of two strata, namely obstetric/postpartum infection or gynecologic/postoperative infection, and were then randomized to ertapenem, 1 g once a day, or piperacillin?tazobactam, 3.375 g every 6 hours, both administered intravenously.

Cure rates for both treatment groups were also similar when compared by stratum and severity of infection.
