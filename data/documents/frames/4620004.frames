Motivational interviewing 	Standard practice	High density lipoprotein 	21065	21219	As it occurred with the other lipid parameters, no significant differences were found in HDL-cholesterol levels between the groups (F = 0.048; p = 0.826).
Motivational interviewing 	Standard practice	High density lipoprotein 	20863	21219	Conversely, no significant differences were observed in HDL-cholesterol levels after the intervention when assessed globally (MD = 0.28; 95 % CI: −2.26 to 1.69 mg/dl; Friedman test = 3.591; p = 0.309). As it occurred with the other lipid parameters, no significant differences were found in HDL-cholesterol levels between the groups (F = 0.048; p = 0.826).
Motivational interviewing 	Standard practice	Total cholesterol	-1	-1	The mean level of cholesterol dropped significantly in the two groups during the follow-up period (mean difference -MD- = −19.60; 95 % 95 % CI: −15.33 to −23.87 mg/dl; Friedman test = 91.756; p < 0.001), with no differences between the two groups (F = 0.021; p = 0.996).
Motivational interviewing 	Standard practice	Waist circumference	22487	22686	As to waist circumference, we observed a significant reduction in the total sample (MD = −0.100 to −1.607 cm; Friedman = 47.086; p < 0.001), with no differences between groups (F = 0.927; p = 0.449).
