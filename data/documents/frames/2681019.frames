Red wine	Control	Adiponectin in women	785	876	Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, P < 0.05)
Ethanol solution	Control	Adiponectin in men	7325	7531	Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, P < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, P < 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, P < 0.04).
Red wine	Control	Adiponectin in women	7325	7531	Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, P < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, P < 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, P < 0.04).
Ethanol solution	Control	Adiponectin in men	785	1061	Among women, adiponectin significantly increased after consuming red wine (29.8%, P < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, P < 0.05) and consuming beer (16.1%, P < 0.05). De-alcoholized beverages had no substantial effect on adiponectin concentrations.
Beer	Control	Adiponectin in men	7325	7531	Among females, adiponectin significantly increased after intervention with red wine (29.8%, P < 0.05) and increased among men after ethanol solution (17.4%, P < 0.05) and beer consumption (16.1%, P < 0.04).
