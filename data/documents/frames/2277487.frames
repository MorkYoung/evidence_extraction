Perioperative chemotherapy + surgery	Surgery alone	Progression-free survival	20341	20756	When the usual definition of progression-free survival was used to compare treatments in all 364 randomised patients (ie, those not operated or not resected were not penalised as events until further disease progression or death), the HR was 0·76 (0·59–0·98, p=0·023) corresponding to a 7·3% increase in the rate of progression-free survival at 3 years from 28·6% (21·7–35·8) to 37·9% (30·5–45·3) with chemotherapy.
Perioperative chemotherapy + surgery	Surgery alone	Reversible postoperative complication	18446	18556	Reversible postoperative complications occurred more often after chemotherapy than after surgery alone (p=0·04
Perioperative chemotherapy + surgery	Surgery alone	Reversible postoperative complication	18446	18566	Reversible postoperative complications occurred more often after chemotherapy than after surgery alone (p=0·04; table 3)
