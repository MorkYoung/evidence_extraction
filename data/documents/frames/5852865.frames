Diacetate esters of macular carotenoids	Lutein	Macular pigment optical density	11308	11441	Using two-tailed Student's t-test, we found a significant difference when comparing the change in MPOD for the two groups (p=0.0287).
Diacetate esters of macular carotenoids	Lutein	Macular pigment optical density	480	965	In this study, we compared the changes in macular pigment over a 24-week supplementation period for two groups of 24 subjects each assigned to either of two supplement formulations, 20 mg/day of lutein or 20 mg equivalent free carotenoids of a combination of diacetate esters of the macular carotenoids. The latter group responded with a larger increase (0.0666 ± 0.0481) in macular pigment optical density than the former group (0.0398 ± 0.0430), driven largely by the older subjects.
Diacetate esters of macular carotenoids	Lutein	Macular pigment increase when baseline is high	1023	1230	There was a general trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for those subjects whose baseline value was high. However, the trend was only significant (p < 0.05) for subjects in the diacetate group
