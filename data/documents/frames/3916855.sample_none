0	8	vitamin A	placebo	reduction in serum ferritin level	The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).
1	8	vitamin A	placebo	increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation	The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group (p < 0.01).
2	150	vitamin A	placebo	except TIBC	The changes of all indices except TIBC were found to be significantly higher among children allocated to vitamin A group than those allocated to placebo group (p < 0.01).
3	153	vitamin A	placebo	SF levels	There was a reduction in the SF levels at three months by 1.50 Î¼g/L of baseline levels in the vitamin A group and this change was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that in the placebo group.
4	154	vitamin A	placebo	mean changes ( reduction ) in TIBC	Similarly, the mean changes (reduction) in TIBC was higher in the vitamin A group than the placebo group but this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
5	158	placebo	vitamin A - supplemented	prevalence of anaemia	Similarly, vitamin A-supplemented children showed a reduction in the prevalence of anaemia by 20.0% over the prevalence at baseline compared to 14.4% among those in the placebo group.
6	194	placebo	vitamin A - supplemented	levels of Hb , SI and TS	Although the levels of Hb, SI and TS were significantly higher in both groups when compared with baseline assessment, our findings clearly indicated that the changes in Hb and other iron status indices after three months were significantly higher in the vitamin A-supplemented children compared to placebo-supplemented children (p < 0.01).
7	194	placebo	vitamin A - supplemented	changes in Hb and other iron status indices	Although the levels of Hb, SI and TS were significantly higher in both groups when compared with baseline assessment, our findings clearly indicated that the changes in Hb and other iron status indices after three months were significantly higher in the vitamin A-supplemented children compared to placebo-supplemented children (p < 0.01).
8	195	vitamin A	placebo	levels of SF and TIBC	In accordance to the general effect, levels of SF and TIBC after three months were significantly lower than baseline measurements among children in the vitamin A group compared with children in the placebo group.
