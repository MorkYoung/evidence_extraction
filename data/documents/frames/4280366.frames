Robotic-assisted gait training	Conventional overground training	Ambulatory motor index	9808	9896	The RAGT group showed more improvement in the AMI with borderline significance (p=0.06).
Robotic-assisted gait training	Conventional overground training	Ambulation ability gain	10199	10372	Patients in the RAGT group showed significant greater gain (from 3 [IQR, 0-14] to 11 [IQR, 0-19]) compared to controls in the WISCI-II (from 4 [IQR, 0-16] to 9 [IQR, 0-20]).
Robotic-assisted gait training	Conventional overground training	Ambulation ability gain	10082	10372	Each group achieved a significant improvement in ambulation ability based on SCIM3-M and WISCI-II (Table 2, Fig. 3). Patients in the RAGT group showed significant greater gain (from 3 [IQR, 0-14] to 11 [IQR, 0-19]) compared to controls in the WISCI-II (from 4 [IQR, 0-16] to 9 [IQR, 0-20]).
Robotic-assisted gait training	Conventional overground training	Ambulatory motor index	9808	10080	The RAGT group showed more improvement in the AMI with borderline significance (p=0.06). The AMI improved from 21 (interquartile range [IQR], 10-30) to 25 (IQR, 15-30) in the RAGT group, which was improved from 23 (IQR, 13-30) to 26 (IQR, 16-30) in the conventional group.
