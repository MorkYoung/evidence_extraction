amitriptyline	placebo pill	GASE-AD (antidepressant-specific side effects)	-1	-1	the amitriptyline group reported significantly more side effects (see Table 2 and Fig. 3a).
amitriptyline	placebo pill	medication-attributed, antidepressant-specific side effect score	19651	19960	We found that the amitriptyline group's medication-attributed, antidepressant-specific side effect score was significantly higher after the acquisition phase (p ≤ .001; g = 1.75; CI 1.02–2.49) and after the evocation night (p = .008; g = 0.88; CI 0.22–1.54) than the placebo group's (see Table 2 and Fig. 3b).
amitriptyline	placebo pill	GASE-AD (antidepressant-specific side effects)	1478	1721	After evocation, participants who underwent the conditioning procedure with amitriptyline reported significantly more antidepressant-specific side effects than those who never received amitriptyline, even though both groups received a placebo.
amitriptyline	placebo pill	GASE-generic (generic side effects)	21232	21582	We observed no differences between the groups in either the GASE-generic or GASE-generic-MA (multivariate analyses: group effect F (2, 36) = 1.89, p = .166; time effect F (4, 34) = 2.83, p = .040; group × time interaction effect F (4, 34) = 2.19, p = .091; univariate analyses regarding GASE-generic-MA: time effect F (0.60, 22.20) = 5.43, p = .027).
