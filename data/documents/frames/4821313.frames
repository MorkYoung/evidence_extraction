Cr. and significant decrease in eGFR calculated by MDRD formula in (group 1) when we compare their levels prior to contrast administration with their levels 48 hr after the intervention (S. Cr: 2.32 ± 0.41 vs. 2.42 ± 0.48) and (eGFR by MDRD: 30.22 ± 6.07 vs, 28.97 ± 6.57). Regarding group 2, the results of our study showed no statistical difference in S. Cr. and eGFR calculated by MDRD 48 hr post-procedure (S. Cr: 2.26 ± 0.47 vs. 2.26 ± 0.49) and (eGFR by MDRD: 30.97 ± 7.13 vs. 31.06 ± 7.41).
