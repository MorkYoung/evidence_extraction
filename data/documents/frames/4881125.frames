Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Follow-up negative ETI scores	24813	25044	There were significant differences between groups in follow-up positive ETI scores, F (1, 38) = 8.24, p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.18 (observed power = 0.80), but not for follow-up negative ETI scores, F (1, 38) = 1.39, p = 0.25, ηp2 = 0.04.
Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Anxiety 	24087	24186	Self-affirmation was associated with lower post-manipulation state anxiety compared to the control.
Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Follow-up positive ETI scores	24813	25161	There were significant differences between groups in follow-up positive ETI scores, F (1, 38) = 8.24, p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.18 (observed power = 0.80), but not for follow-up negative ETI scores, F (1, 38) = 1.39, p = 0.25, ηp2 = 0.04. Self-affirmation was associated with higher positive emotions towards teaching at follow-up compared to the control.
Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Self-efficacy	23988	24086	There was no significant effect for self-efficacy scores, F (1, 39) = 0.25, p = 0.62, ηp2 = 0.006.

Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Follow-up positive ETI scores	19123	19669	An adapted version of Trigwell's [26] 20-item Emotions in Teaching Inventory (ETI) was used to measure domain-specific work stress. Participants were asked to provide their level of agreement with 10 statements measuring positive emotions towards teaching (motivation, pride, confidence, satisfaction, and happiness) and 10 statements measuring negative emotions towards teaching (anxiety, embarrassment, frustration, boredom, and annoyance). Responses were recorded on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5).
Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Anxiety 	812	936	Teachers who created work-related self-affirming implementation intentions reported an immediate reduction in state anxiety.
Work-related self-affirming implementation intention	Control	Anxiety 	23843	23987	There was a significant difference between conditions in state anxiety scores, F (1, 39) = 24.29, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.38 (observed power = 0.99).
