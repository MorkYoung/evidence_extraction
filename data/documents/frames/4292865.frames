E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Evident bleeding	1222	1590	The complications occurred in 20 (11.2%) patients from the E-mode group: pancreatitis in 6 (3.4%) and endoscopically evident bleeding in 14 (7.8%). In contrast, the complications occurred in 25 (13.8%) patients from the C-mode group: pancreatitis in 7 (3.9%) and endoscopically evident bleeding in 18 (9.9%), although these findings were not statistically significant.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Amylase levels	17659	17975	The median serum total amylase levels after EST was 122 IU/L (range, 29 to 7280 IU/L) and 153 IU/L (range, 18 to 6986 IU/L) in the E-mode group and the conventional blended C-mode group, respectively. Thus, there was no significant clinical difference of the serum total amylase levels after EST between both groups.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Perforation	17151	17187	No patients experienced perforation.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Evident bleeding	16619	16892	There were 14 (7.8%) patients with endoscopically evident bleeding in the E-mode group versus 18 (9.9%) patients with endoscopically evident bleeding in the conventional blended C-mode group. The frequency of endoscopically evident bleeding was not significantly different.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Amylase levels	17860	17975	Thus, there was no significant clinical difference of the serum total amylase levels after EST between both groups.

In contrast, the complications occurred in 25 (13.8%) patients from the C-mode group: pancreatitis in 7 (3.9%) and endoscopically evident bleeding in 18 (9.9%), although these findings were not statistically significant.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Pancreatitis	16318	16618	There were 6 (3.4%) patients with pancreatitis in the E-mode group (5 mild and 1 moderate pancreatitis) versus 7 (3.9%) patients with pancreatitis (7 mild pancreatitis) in the conventional blended C-mode group. There was no significant difference of the frequency of pancreatitis between both groups.
E-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	C-mode Endoscopic sphincterotomy	Hemorrhage 	16893	17034	There was no case of clinically evident hemorrhage in either group at the time of EST, 24 hours after EST, or within 7 days of randomization.
