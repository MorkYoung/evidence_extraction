higher adherence to energy goals	lesser adherence to energy goals	weight loss, first 6 months	1343	1495	In the first six months, adherence to attendance, self-monitoring and the energy goal were significantly associated with greater weight loss (P < 0.05).
higher adherence to fat gram goal	lesser adherence to fat gram goal	weight loss, first 6 months	23693	23840	However, no significant difference in weight loss was observed between those who were adherent and those who were not adherent to the fat gram goal
more frequent self monitoring	less frequent monitoring	weight loss, first 6 months	1343	1495	In the first six months, adherence to attendance, self-monitoring and the energy goal were significantly associated with greater weight loss (P < 0.05).
higher adherence to energy goals	lesser adherence to energy goals	weight loss, first 6 months	23328	23681	In the first six months, the mean weight loss from baseline was − 9.42 ± 5.93% (−8.81 ± 5.96 kg). Using univariate regression models controlling for the effect of time, we found greater weight loss was significantly associated with greater attendance, more frequent self-monitoring, and higher adherence to exercise and energy goals (P for all < 0.0001)
more frequent self monitoring	less frequent monitoring	weight loss, first 6 months	23328	23681	In the first six months, the mean weight loss from baseline was − 9.42 ± 5.93% (−8.81 ± 5.96 kg). Using univariate regression models controlling for the effect of time, we found greater weight loss was significantly associated with greater attendance, more frequent self-monitoring, and higher adherence to exercise and energy goals (P for all < 0.0001)
