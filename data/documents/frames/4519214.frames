Training with visual functions	Control group	Visual search performance	971	1120	The results of this experiment proved that an 8-week long perceptual training program significantly differentiated the plot of visual detecting time.
Training with visual functions	Control group	Visual detection time	1685	1783	Our study suggests that 8-week training of visual functions can improve visual search performance.
Training with visual functions	Control group	Visual detection time	971	1303	The results of this experiment proved that an 8-week long perceptual training program significantly differentiated the plot of visual detecting time. For the visual detecting time changes, the first factor, Group, was significant as a main effect (F(1,22)=6.49, p<0.05) as well as the second factor, Training (F(3,66)=5.06, p<0.01).
Training with visual functions	Control group	Visual search performance	12781	13562	Perceptual training significantly differentiated the plot of changes in visual detection time when the experimental and control groups were compared. ANOVA contrast analysis indicated a differential effect between the experimental and control groups after two months of perceptual training (Sig_2: F(1.22)=13.10, p<0.01) and 4 weeks following the research accomplishment (Sig_c: F(1.22)=7.29, p<0.05). ANOVA contrast analysis also indicated significant intra-group differences among the experimental subjects after one month of perceptual training ((Sig_0 vs Sig_1: (F(1.22)=5.97, p<0.05)) and (Sig_1 vs Sig_2: (F(1.22)=6.38, p<0.05)). The visual detection time improved during and after training stimulation in comparison to the baseline (Sig_0 vs. Sig_2: F(1.22)=24.44, p<0.001).
