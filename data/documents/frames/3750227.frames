Enalapril	Olmesartan	Hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L	1545	1693	The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol/L did not differ between treatments: 37% for olmesartan and 40% for enalapril.
Enalapril	Olmesartan	Microalbuminuria decrease	1884	1985	The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients)
Enalapril	Olmesartan	Microalbuminuria decrease	1884	2012	The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar (23% in olmesartan and 29% in enalapril patients) in the 4 weeks time point.
Enalapril	Olmesartan	Urinary potassium	2131	2207	There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion.
Enalapril	Olmesartan	Glomerular filtration rate increase 	1694	1883	The mean e-GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml/mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study.
Enalapril	Olmesartan	Urinary potassium	22355	22652	Furthermore, among those terminating the study there were no significant differences in urinary potassium with respect to baseline values (79.6 ± 9.4 vs. 81.1 ± 8.1 mmol/L for olmesartan and 81.7 ± 15.2 vs. 62.7 ± 6.5 mmol/L for enalapril) or appreciable changes in daily urine sodium elimination.
