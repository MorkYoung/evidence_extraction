cohort B, the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5 with top blastocysts and with non-top blastocysts 	control	live birth rates (LBR)	2155	2373	In cohort B, LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % (hCG) and 48.4 % (control), with non-top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % (hCG) and 35.0 % (control). The differences between the groups were statistically not significant.
