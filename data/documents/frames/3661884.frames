the static stretching (SSG) or passive interval (PIG)	baseline	flexibility of joints	1641	1762	Both groups showed significant increases in flexibility but in different joints (SSGpre vs. SSGpost; PIGpre vs. PIGpost).
the static stretching (SSG) 	passive interval (PIG)	strength in the exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR)	1573	1640	No differences were found between the groups (SSGpost vs. PIGpost).
the static stretching (SSG) or passive interval (PIG)	baseline	strength in the exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR)	1098	1415	Both groups showed significant increases in strength (SSGpre vs. SSGpost; PIGpre vs. PIGpost) in the same exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR). Specifically, in the SSG group, the parameters for LE were (p = 0.0015 and ES = 2.28 - Large), and the parameters for LR were (p = 0.002 and ES = 1.95 - Large).
the static stretching (SSG) 	passive interval (PIG)	cortisol secretion or growth hormone concentration	2390	2495	Hormonal profiles showed no significant differences in cortisol secretion or growth hormone concentration
the static stretching (SSG) 	passive interval (PIG)	strength in the exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR)	1098	1640	Both groups showed significant increases in strength (SSGpre vs. SSGpost; PIGpre vs. PIGpost) in the same exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR). Specifically, in the SSG group, the parameters for LE were (p = 0.0015 and ES = 2.28 - Large), and the parameters for LR were (p = 0.002 and ES = 1.95 - Large). Moreover, in the PIG group, the parameters for LE were (p = 0.009 and ES = 1.95 - Large), and the parameters for LR were (p = 0.0001 and ES = 2.88 - Large). No differences were found between the groups (SSGpost vs. PIGpost).
the static stretching (SSG) or passive interval (PIG)	baseline	flexibility of joints	1641	2229	Both groups showed significant increases in flexibility but in different joints (SSGpre vs. SSGpost; PIGpre vs. PIGpost). In the SSG group, only three joints showed significant increases in flexibility: shoulder extension (p = 0.004 and ES = 1.76 - Large), torso flexion (p = 0.002 and ES = 2.36 - Large), and hip flexion (p = 0.001 and ES = 1.79 -Large). In the PIG group, only three joints showed increases in flexibility: horizontal shoulder abduction (p = 0.003 and ES = 2.07 - Large), hip flexion (p = 0.001 and ES = 2.39 – Large), and hip extension (p = 0.02 and ES = 1.79 - Large).
the static stretching (SSG) 	passive interval (PIG)	cortisol secretion or growth hormone concentration	15862	15981	The results showed no significant differences in the concentration of cortisol and growth hormone (Table 4 – p > 0.05).
the static stretching (SSG) or passive interval (PIG)	baseline	strength in the exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR)	1098	1254	Both groups showed significant increases in strength (SSGpre vs. SSGpost; PIGpre vs. PIGpost) in the same exercises for leg extension (LE) and Low Row (LR).
