Group K, 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine was injected intravenously,	Group N, the same volume (5 mL) of normal saline was injected	the incidence of POM	1467	1568	Overall, the incidence of POM in Group K was significantly less, when compared with Group N (P<0.05),
Group K, 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine was injected intravenously,	Group N, the same volume (5 mL) of normal saline was injected	Postoperative myalgia (POM)	1467	1629	Overall, the incidence of POM in Group K was significantly less, when compared with Group N (P<0.05), but both groups were comparable based on the grade 2 of POM.
Group K, 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine was injected intravenously,	Group N, the same volume (5 mL) of normal saline was injected	Changes in heart rate after induction and intubation	11889	12091	Changes in heart rate after induction and intubation between the two groups were compared and repeated measures of variance analysis showed no significant difference in the two groups (P>0.05; Table 3).
