flavonoid-rich blueberry drink	matched placebo	differences at baseline between groups for IQ	17257	17437	There were no significant differences at baseline between groups for IQ (Ravens: WBB group, M = 26.78, SD = 4.31; Placebo group, M = 26.55, SD = 5. 98; F(1,47) = 0.024, p = 0.878),
flavonoid-rich blueberry drink	matched placebo	reduction in negative affect (NA) 2 h after consuming	16693	17121	After consuming both placebo and WBB drinks, the participants reported a reduction in NA (pre: M = 13.17, SD = 2.67 and post: M = 12.19, SD = 2.49; Figure 1b). This may be explained by postprandial blood glucose effects due to the matched sugar content of both drinks. There was no significant main effect of Drink on NA (F(1,20) = 0.67, p = 0.42) and no significant Drink x Session interaction on NA (F(1,20) = 0.51, p = 0.49).
flavonoid-rich blueberry drink	matched placebo	positive affect (PA)	15835	15988	there was a significant increase in PA after consuming the WBB drink (pre: M = 22.76, SD = 9.01 and post: M = 29.48, SD = 8.60; t(20) = âˆ’4.68, p < 0.001)
