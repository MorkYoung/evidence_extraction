VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Quality of life improvement 	33156	33478	Patients in the LD group reported the greatest degree of improvement at the 90 day, 6 and 9 month visits. At 90 days, only 17.6% (3/17) of patients in the P group were much or very much improved whereas 48.4% (15/31) of patients in the LD group and 30.6% (11/36) of patients in the HD group were much or very much improved
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Urinalysis abnormalities 	21438	21567	There were no significant abnormalities in the urinalysis, hematology, and clinical chemistry results across all treatment groups
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Urinalysis abnormalities 	21438	21585	There were no significant abnormalities in the urinalysis, hematology, and clinical chemistry results across all treatment groups (data not shown).
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Significant adverse events	758	820	There were no significant adverse events attributable to VM202
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	≥50% reduction in mean pain	864	1211	Patients receiving 8 mg VM202 per leg improved the most in all efficacy measures including a significant (P = 0.03) reduction at 3 months in the mean pain score and continued but not statistically significant reductions in pain at 6 and 9 months. Of these patients, 48.4% experienced a ≥50% reduction in pain compared to 17.6% of placebo patients.
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Quality of life improvement 	28234	28700	Patients in the LD group experienced an overall improvement, in general, in quality of life due to a reduction in pain. This included improvements in some or all of the following: activity, mood, walking ability, ability to work, relationship with other people, sleep, and overall enjoyment of life. Improvements achieved statistical significance in the LD group compared to P group at both 3 and 6 months (−45.29%, P = 0.046, and −37.90%, P = 0.046, respectively) (
VM202 plasmid (16mg)	Placebo	≥50% reduction in mean pain	27037	27272	patients in the LD group had nearly threefold more responders than Placebo (P = 0.06; P: 17.6% responders, LD: 48.4% responders). Patients in the HD group had 27.8% responders which was not statistically significant compared to Placebo
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Significant adverse events	758	821	There were no significant adverse events attributable to VM202.
VM202 plasmid (8mg)	Placebo	Hematology abnormalities 	21438	21567	There were no significant abnormalities in the urinalysis, hematology, and clinical chemistry results across all treatment groups
