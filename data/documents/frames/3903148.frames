high altitude	near sea level	respiratory disturbance index	18658	18853	Compared with baseline, the respiratory disturbance index (figure 3A) was very likely higher on the first nights at altitude and almost certainly higher after 1 and 2 weeks at altitude (table 2).
high altitude	near sea level	REM Sleep after 1 week	17306	17400	After a week at altitude, deep sleep (figure 2C) and REM sleep (figure 2D) were possibly lower
high altitude	near sea level	Deep Sleep after 1 week	17306	17400	After a week at altitude, deep sleep (figure 2C) and REM sleep (figure 2D) were possibly lower
high altitude	near sea level	stage N2 sleep after 1 week	17406	17467	stage N2 sleep was possibly higher than on the baseline night
