aromatase inhibitors (AIs) - letrozole	tamoxifen	overall response rate	750	836	The overall response rate (ORR) was 55% for letrozole and 36% for tamoxifen (P < 0.001
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) - letrozole	tamoxifen	reducing tumor proliferation	1716	1876	Furthermore, when analyzed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, letrozole was significantly more effective than tamoxifen in reducing tumor proliferation (P = 0.0009).
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) - letrozole	tamoxifen	numbers of breast-conserving surgery	839	959	Significantly more letrozole-treated patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (45 vs. 35%, respectively; P = 0.022).
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) - letrozole	tamoxifen	numbers of breast-conserving surgery	12042	12225	The proportion of patients able to undergo breast-conserving surgery was significantly higher in the letrozole group than in the tamoxifen group (45 vs. 35%, respectively; P = 0.022).
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) - letrozole	tamoxifen	overall response rate	11371	11438	The ORR was 55% for letrozole versus 36% for tamoxifen (P < 0.001).
