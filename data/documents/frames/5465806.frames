Plant sterols (PS)	placebo	individual biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation	1454	1580	The intake of PS did not significantly change the individual biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation.
Plant sterols (PS)	placebo	The z-scores for endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation	1581	1781	The z-scores for endothelial dysfunction (−0·02; 95 % CI −0·15, 0·11) and low-grade inflammation (−0·04; 95 % CI −0·16, 0·07) were also not significantly changed after PS intake compared with placebo.
Plant sterols (PS)	placebo	The z-scores for endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation	-1	-1	In agreement, the z-score for low-grade inflammation was not changed after PS intake v. placebo (log z-score: −0·04 (95 % CI −0·16, 0·07)). Table 2.
