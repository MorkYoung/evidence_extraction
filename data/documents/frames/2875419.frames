glargine	detemir	frequency of insulin doses	6800	6914	Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower for glargine: 43.5 ± 29.0 versus 76.5 ± 50.5 units/day (P < 0.001
detemir	glargine	number of patients with A1C <7%	-1	-1	27.5 and 25.6% of patients reached the primary outcome with glargine and detemir, respectively, demonstrating the noninferiority of glargine. Improvements in A1C were ?1.46 ± 1.09% for glargine and ?1.54 ± 1.11% for detemir (P = 0.149), with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% (P = 0.254)
glargine	detemir	frequency of insulin doses	6801	6903	nsulin doses, however, were significantly lower for glargine: 43.5 ± 29.0 versus 76.5 ± 50.5 units/day
detemir	glargine	number of patients with A1C <7%	-1	-1	Improvements in A1C were ?1.46 � 1.09% for glargine and ?1.54 � 1.11% for detemir (P = 0.149), with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% (P = 0.254) but more detemir-treated patients reaching A1C <6.5% (P = 0.017).
glargine	detemir	frequency of insulin doses	6800	6925	Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower for glargine: 43.5 ± 29.0 versus 76.5 ± 50.5 units/day (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1B)
glargine	detemir	Weight Gain	1101	1170	Weight gain was higher for glargine (difference: 0.77 kg, P < 0.001).
detemir	glargine	improved A1C	-1	-1	Improvements in A1C were ?1.46 � 1.09% for glargine and ?1.54 � 1.11% for detemir (P = 0.149), with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% (P = 0.254) but more detemir-treated patients reaching A1C <6.5% (P = 0.017).
detemir	glargine	number of patients with A1C <7%	5988	6219	The proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% were also similar (44.1 and 47.8%, respectively, P = 0.254), but significantly fewer glargine- than detemir-treated patients reached A1C <6.5% (16.5 and 22.7%, respectively, P = 0.017).
detemir	glargine	number of patients with A1C <7%	937	1003	with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C <7% (P = 0.254)
detemir	glargine	Hypoglycemia	1070	1100	Hypoglycemia risk was similar.
detemir	glargine	drop-out rate	9638	9798	Detemir-treated patients had less weight gain and more often achieved A1C <6.5%, but the drop-out rate and daily insulin doses were lower in the glargine group.
glargine	detemir	frequency of insulin doses	8014	8322	Moreover, trial data suggest that, although insulin doses are indeed higher in patients using detemir twice- versus once-daily, once-daily detemir doses are still higher than once-daily NPH and glargine doses (3,10,11). At present there is no clear explanation for the increased dose requirements for detemir
