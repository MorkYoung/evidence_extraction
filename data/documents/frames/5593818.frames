JinqiJiangtang tablets (JQJT tablets, a traditional Chinese patent medicine)	placebo	mean age	-1	-1	The distributions of the demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups were reasonably well-balanced, except that the mean age in the placebo group was younger than that in the JQJT tablets group (53.49 ± 8.85 vs. 55.49 ± 8.61, P = 0.036).Table 1
