methylprednisolone	serratiopeptidase	trismus	12097	12402	statistical significance was observed between group I and II (P<0.001) i.e. resolution of trismus was better in group II than in group I. (Un paired t–test) This attests to the probable fact that serratiopeptidase is better than methylprednisolone in resolving trismus post-operatively ( Table 3, Fig. 3).
methylprednisolone	serratiopeptidase	post-operative pain	11274	11488	These observations indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups (p<0.05), suggesting that pain control efficacy in group I was better than in group II (Chi-square test) ( Table 2, Fig. 2).
methylprednisolone	serratiopeptidase	trismus	12095	12382	, statistical significance was observed between group I and II (P<0.001) i.e. resolution of trismus was better in group II than in group I. (Un paired t–test) This attests to the probable fact that serratiopeptidase is better than methylprednisolone in resolving trismus post-operatively
