Esmolol group	Control group	Heart rate	981	1216	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05)
Esmolol group	Control group	Mean arterial pressure after the surgery	1229	1363	the mean arterial pressure, which was higher in the esmolol group compared with the control group at 5 and 12 h post-surgery (P<0.05).
Esmolol group	Control group	Central venous pressure	981	1217	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05),
Esmolol group	Control group	Cardiac troponin I during the preoperative period	1373	1536	the serum level of cardiac troponin I was higher in patients of the control group compared with those of the esmolol group during the preoperative period (P<0.05).
Esmolol group	Control group	Serum levels of CK	14459	14883	The serum levels of CK (Fig. 2B) did not show any significant difference between the two groups at four of the five time points (baseline, before aortic cannulation, before aortic cross-clamp and 120 min after the release of aortic cross-clamp); however, the levels were significantly higher in the esmolol group compared with the control group (esmolol group, 125.67±30.81 IU/ml; control group, 89.67±23.31 IU/ml; P=0.002).
Esmolol group	Control group	Central venous pressure	981	1216	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05)
Esmolol group	Control group	Heart rate	981	1217	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05),
Esmolol group	Control group	Mean arterial pressure after the surgery	981	1363	No significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, including the central venous pressure and heart rate, were detected between patients in the two groups during the perioperative period or within the first 12 h post-surgery (P>0.05), except for the mean arterial pressure, which was higher in the esmolol group compared with the control group at 5 and 12 h post-surgery (P<0.05).
Esmolol group	Control group	Cardiac troponin I during the preoperative period	1364	1536	However, the serum level of cardiac troponin I was higher in patients of the control group compared with those of the esmolol group during the preoperative period (P<0.05).
