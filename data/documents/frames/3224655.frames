routine	routine + NIV	6 minute walking distance	18192	18301	The 6-minute walking distance increased significantly in the NIV group (232 ± 151 m to 282 ± 146 m, P = 0.01)
routine pharmacological treatment	routine treatment and NIV	lung function	18511	19475	Patients actively treated with NIV developed a more inhomogeneous redistribution of mass flow than control patients (Figure 6). Subsequent analysis indicated that in NIV-treated patients who improved their blood gases, mass flow was redistributed towards areas with higher vessel density and less emphysema, indicating that flow was redistributed towards areas with better perfusion. There was a highly significant correlation between the percentage increase in mass flow towards lobes with a blood vessel density of >9% and the increase in PaO2 (Figure 7). This phenomenon can explain the increase in oxygenation seen in the NIV group as a consequence of improved ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) match. The lowering of the PaCO2 in the NIV group (PaCO2 at baseline 55.4 mmHg, PaCO2 after 6 months of NIV 44.5 mmHg, difference 10.9 mmHg, P = 0.007) can be explained by increased alveolar ventilation by recruitment of the previously occluded peripheral, small airways.
routine pharmacological treatment	routine + NIV	FEV1	1298	1354	In both groups there was a nonsignificant change in FEV1
routine	routine + NIV	paco2	1445	1577	PaCO2 dropped significantly only in the NIV group (NIV: 55.4 [7.7] → 44.5 [4.70], P = 0.0076; control: 52.4 [6.0] → 47.6 [8.2], NS).
routine pharmacological treatment	routine + NIV	FEV1	17846	18031	In both groups there was a nonsignificant change in FEV1 (NIV group 29.5 [standard deviation (SD) ±9.0] to 38.5 [SD ± 14.6] %pred; control group 30.5 [SD ± 5.1] to 36.8 [SD ± 8.7] mmHg)
