Although the proportion resolving among the foals with larger lesions (ie, ≥27 mm) was lower for the GaM‐treated foals than the CLR‐treated foals, this difference was not significant (Table 2).

One foal (a GaM‐treated foal) was euthanized because it developed colic, underwent celiotomy, and was found to have a septic mesenteric lymphadenitis caused by R. equi, and a mesenteric rent with small intestinal entrapment; necropsy revealed chronic, focal granulomatous pneumonia and subacute, multifocal hepatitis attributed to R equi on the basis of microbiologic culture; this foal had been treated for 15 days. One of the CLR/rifampin‐treated foals was anesthetized for an orthopedic surgical procedure; this foal died during anesthesia, and death was attributed to respiratory failure resulting from bilateral necrotizing granulomatous pneumonia caused by R. equi infection; this foal had been treated for 2 days.
