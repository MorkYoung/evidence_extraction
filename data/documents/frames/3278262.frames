Packaging Instructions	Control	performing successfully two of the seven MOCUS items	13534	13665	As can be seen in Table 2, those who read the packaging instructions performed significantly better on two of the seven MOCUS items
Packaging Instructions	Control	the mean MOCUS score	13019	13405	the mean MOCUS score among those in the Packaging Instructions Group was higher than that in the Control Group. This difference was modest and amounted to an average of approximately one-third of a MOCUS item better performance for the Packaging Instructions Group (ie, approximately one-quarter of a standard deviation) and was non-significant (F[1, 203] = 2.90, P = 0.09, η2 = 0.014).
