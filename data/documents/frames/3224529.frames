neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA)	pressure support ventilation (PSV)	episodes of central apnea and ineffective efforts	1843	2016	There were large differences in ineffective efforts (24 ± 23 per hour of sleep in PSV, and 0 during NAVA) and episodes of central apnea (10.5 ± 11 in PSV vs. 0 during NAVA).
neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA)	pressure support ventilation (PSV)	episodes of central apnea and ineffective efforts	17502	17779	The mean index of sleep apneas (number of apneas per hour of sleep) was 10.5 ± 11 apneas during PSV and 0 during NAVA (p = 0.005) and ineffective efforts (number of ineffective efforts per hour of sleep) was 24 ± 23 ineffective efforts during PSV and 0 during NAVA (p = 0.001).
neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA)	pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Proportions of REM sleep duration	1560	1842	Proportions of REM sleep duration were different in the two ventilatory modes (4.5% (range, 3-11%) in PSV and 16.5% (range, 13-29%) during NAVA (p = 0.001)), as well as the fragmentation index, with 40 ± 20 arousals and awakenings per hour in PSV and 16 ± 9 during NAVA (p = 0.001).
