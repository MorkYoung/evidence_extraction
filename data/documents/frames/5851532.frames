Self-collected vaginal specimens	Provider-collected cervical swabs	Positive Predictive Value or Negative Predictive Value	37696	37895	No statistically significant differences in Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value by randomization order, current hormone use, longer duration of hormone use.
Self-collected vaginal specimens	Provider-collected cervical swabs	Positive Predictive Value or Negative Predictive Value	38651	38846	There were no statistically significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or NPV for provider-collected cervical vs. self-collected vaginal hrHPV DNA specimens by randomization order.
Self-collected vaginal specimens	Provider-collected cervical swabs	Sensitivity and specificity	35567	35902	Compared to provider-collected cervical specimens (gold standard), hrHPV DNA hybridization assay via self-collected vaginal specimen had a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI: 0.52, 0.91) and a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI: 0.96, 1.00). There was substantial concordance between the sampling methods (Îº = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.92; p<0.0001).
