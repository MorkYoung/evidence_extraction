olanzapine	placebo	sleep efficiency 	-1	-1	Two two-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed an increase in TST (trend for main effect of treatment, F[1,23]?=?3.69, p?=?0.067) and sleep efficiency (main effect of treatment, F[1,23]?=?5.10, p?=?0.034)
olanzapine	placebo	Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item (HDRS-17)	28195	28386	Two-way repeated ANOVA showed no significant differences between olanzapine and placebo treatment for MARDS or HDRS scores (F[1,23] = 1.09, p = .306; F[1,23] = 0.269, p = .609, respectively).
olanzapine	placebo	Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Spatial Span (SSP), and Reaction Time (RTI) tasks	2389	2503	There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo-treated participants in SWM, SSP or RTI tasks.
olanzapine	placebo	sleep efficiency 	1901	2104	A significant improvement in olanzapine-treated participants over placebo-treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep latency.
olanzapine	placebo	awake time	-1	-1	ut by Day 28â€“31, olanzapine treatment was significantly decreasing amount of awake time participants experienced (t23?=?2.26, p?=?0.003).
olanzapine	placebo	awake time	26551	26876	As well as an increase in TST, olanzapine treated participants experienced significantly fewer awakenings (Table  <NEWLINE>2) and less overall time awake compared to treatment with placebo (2-way repeated measures ANOVA; main effect of treatment, number of awakenings, F[1,23] = 10.0, p = 0.004; awake time, F[1,23] = 4.8, p = 0.037).
