droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Improvement in symptom-impact subscore	1052	1183	Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for "standing a long time."
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP), mean supine systolic BP	1184	1331	Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001).
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	adverse events	1552	1626	No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Improvement Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ)	919	1050	Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in "dizziness/lightheadedness.
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP), mean supine systolic BP	14222	14441	From randomization to end of study, standing systolic BP increased by a mean (SD) of 11.2 (22.9) mm Hg in droxidopa recipients vs 3.9 (16.3) in placebo recipients, a difference of 7.3 mm Hg (95% CI 1.1–13.5; p < 0.001).
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Improvement Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ)	779	918	From randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003).
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	Improvement in symptom-impact subscore	13780	14032	For symptom-impact composite score, mean (SD) change was −1.98 (2.31) vs −0.92 (1.82) units, favoring droxidopa by 1.06 units (95% CI 0.41–1.71; p = 0.003), with statistically significant differences from placebo on all symptom-impact items (figure 2).
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	systolic BP while supine	14817	15100	From randomization to end of study, systolic BP while supine increased by 7.6 (19.2) mm Hg in droxidopa recipients vs 0.8 (14.5) in placebo recipients, a difference of 6.8 mm Hg (95% CI 1.53–12.07; p < 0.001), to mean (SD) values of 133.7 (23.3) and 125.9 (22.2) mm Hg, respectively.
droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily)	placebo	adverse events	16515	16819	During double-blind treatment, 15 droxidopa (18.5% of 81) and 12 placebo (14.8% of 81) recipients reported AEs (see table e-3), most frequently headache (in 7.4% of droxidopa and no placebo recipients), dizziness (in 3.7% vs 1.2%), fatigue (2.5% vs 2.5%), syncope (2.5% vs 1.2%), and falls (0.0% vs 3.7%)
