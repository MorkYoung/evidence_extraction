mirabegron (50 and 100 mg)	placebo	mean volume voided/micturition, mean level of urgency, mean number of urgency episodesand mean number of urgency incontinence episodes/24 h	26790	27236	Both 50 and 100 mg mirabegron doses were associated with statistically significant improvements from baseline to Final Visit compared with placebo for the key secondary efficacy end-points of mean volume voided/micturition (p < 0.05 for all comparisons; Table 2), mean level of urgency, mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4)/24 h and mean number of urgency incontinence episodes/24 h (p < 0.05 for all comparisons; Table 2 and Figure 5).
mirabegron (50 and 100 mg)	placebo	the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analogue Scale (TS-VAS)	28808	29206	In health-related quality of life outcomes, mirabegron 50 and 100 mg was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the TS-VAS score at Final Visit compared with placebo (p < 0.05; Table 2). The adjusted mean (95% CI) changes from baseline to Final Visit were 1.25 (1.08, 1.42), 2.01 (1.84, 2.19) and 2.33 (2.11, 2.55) for the placebo, mirabegron 50 and 100 mg groups, respectively.

mirabegron (50 and 100 mg)	placebo	the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h and the mean number of micturitions/24 h	-1	-1	Mirabegron at doses of 50 and 100 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline to Final Visit compared with placebo in reducing the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h and the mean number of micturitions/24 h (p < 0.05 for all comparisons; Table 2 and Figures 3 and 4, respectively). The adjusted mean (95% CI) change from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes/24 h was ?1.10 (?1.23, ?0.97), ?1.49 (?1.63, ?1.36) and ?1.50 (?1.67, ?1.34) in the placebo, mirabegron 50 and 100 mg groups, respectively, and ?1.20 (?1.34, ?1.06), ?1.75 (?1.89, ?1.61), ?1.74 (?1.91, ?1.56) for the adjusted mean change from baseline to Final Visit in the mean number of micturitions/24.
mirabegron (50 and 100 mg)	placebo	mean number of nocturia episodes/24 h	27238	27577	Significant improvements were also evident in the pooled efficacy analysis with respect to the change from baseline to Final Visit (95% CI) in the mean number of nocturia episodes/24 h in the mirabegron 50 mg [−0.55 (−0.62, −0.49)] and mirabegron 100 mg groups [−0.54 (−0.62, −0.46)] vs. placebo [−0.42 (−0.48, −0.35)] (p < 0.05; Table 2).
