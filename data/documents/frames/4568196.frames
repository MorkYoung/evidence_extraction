hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL), hypocaloric diet enriched with legumes (HDEL)	baseline	high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) after 3 weeks	1101	1208	Both hypocaloric diets reduced hs-CRP in 3 weeks and returned it to basal values after 6 weeks (P = 0.004).
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL)	baseline	total cholesterol (TC)	1209	1295	HDWL significantly reduced WHR [P = 0.010 (3.2%)] and increased TC [P < 0.001 (6.3%)].
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL), hypocaloric diet enriched with legumes (HDEL)	baseline	high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) after 3 weeks	23347	23453	both hypocaloric diets reduced hs-CRP in 3 weeks and returned it to basal values after 6 weeks (P = 0.004)
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL), hypocaloric diet enriched with legumes (HDEL)	baseline	high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) after 3 weeks	17338	17416	both HDEL and HDWL significantly reduced the hs-CRP level in the first 3 weeks
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL), hypocaloric diet enriched with legumes (HDEL)	baseline	high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) after 6 weeks	16656	16906	Time effect: Both HDEL and HDWL significantly reduced the hs-CRP level in the first 3 weeks and returned it to basal levels in the subsequent 3 weeks (P = 0.004) but this significant effect disappeared after controlling of WC and/or weight reduction.
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL)	baseline	total cholesterol (TC)	17186	17257	HDWL significantly increased TC in 6 weeks as much as 6.3% (P = 0.000);
hypocaloric diet without legumes (HDWL)	baseline	low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)	17262	17332	HDWL marginally increased LDL-C in the first 3 weeks (8.4%, P = 0.060)
hypocaloric diet enriched with legumes (HDEL)	baseline	total antioxidant capacity (TAC)	1296	1428	Despite the significant effect of HDEL on increasing TAC in 3 weeks [P = 0.050 (4%)], the level of TAC remained the same in 6 weeks.
