1	52	pramlintide / insulin	placebo / insulin	increments of glucose and glucagon	Compared with placebo/insulin, all three pramlintide/insulin ratios produced marked and statistically equivalent reductions of increments of glucose and glucagon in the first hour, with levels subsequently increasing.
2	55	glucagon	placebo	AUC0 – 3 h	Reductions of AUC0–3 h for glucagon for the 6, 9 and 12 mcg/U were 57, 59 and 55% (Table 1; all doses vs placebo: p < 0.05).
