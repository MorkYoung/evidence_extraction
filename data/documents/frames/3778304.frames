Critical weight loss	No critical weight loss	5-year disease-specific survival rate	1315	1488	The 5-year OS and DSS rates for patients with critical WL during radiotherapy were 62% and 82%, compared with 70% and 89% for patients without critical WL (P=0.01; P=0.001).
Critical weight loss	No critical weight loss	5-year overall survival rate	1315	1488	The 5-year OS and DSS rates for patients with critical WL during radiotherapy were 62% and 82%, compared with 70% and 89% for patients without critical WL (P=0.01; P=0.001).
Critical weight loss	No critical weight loss	5-year overall survival rate	878	1114	Before radiotherapy, 70% of patients had no WL, 16% had ⩽5% WL, 9% had >5–10% WL, and 5% had >10% WL. Five-year OS and DSS rates for these groups were 71%, 59%, 47%, and 42% (P<0.001), and 86%, 86%, 81%, and 71%, respectively (P<0.001).

Critical weight loss	No critical weight loss	5-year overall survival rate	14775	14959	Patients with critical weight loss had lower 5-year overall survival rates than patients without critical weight loss during radiotherapy (survival rates: 62% vs 70% log rank: P=0.01).
Critical weight loss	No critical weight loss	5-year disease-specific survival rate	15080	15262	The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for patients with critical weight loss was 82%, compared with 89% for patients without critical weight loss (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.3; P=0.001
