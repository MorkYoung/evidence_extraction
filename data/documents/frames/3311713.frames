EX exercise treatment for the regain (+50% of weight lost) phase	NOEX no-exercise treatment for the regain (+50% of weight lost) phase	Decrease in lumbar spine mineral density (BMD)	18390	18963	Weight loss had no effect on bone area of the total body (Baseline= 1987 ± 33 cm2; Post-weight loss= 1970 ± 34 cm2), lumbar spine (Baseline= 57.1 ± 1.7 cm2; Post-weight loss= 57.3 ± 1.4 cm2) and total hip (Baseline= 31.1 ± 0.7 cm2; Post-weight loss= 31.2 ± 0.7 cm2). There were no differences in weight-loss-associated changes in total hip or lumbar spine BMD between participants who were subsequently randomized to the EX and NOEX groups during weight regain (Total hip BMD: EX= −1.8 ± 0.6% vs. NOEX= −2.2 ± 1.0%; Lumbar spine BMD: EX= −1.2 ± 0.6% vs. NOEX= −1.1 ± 1.0%).
