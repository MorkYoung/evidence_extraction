Motivational interviewing through self-determination theory sessions	Standard education session	Sedentary behavior and agility test	1269	1699	Four months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= − 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=− 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group.
