Daily prednisone 	Placebo	Insulin concentration 	19505	19635	Increases from baseline in both glucose and insulin concentrations at 0.5 h were observed for all prednisone doses and for placebo
Daily prednisone 	Placebo	Insulin concentration 	19705	19872	After 6 days of prednisone treatment, the changes from baseline in both glucose and insulin concentrations relative to placebo were not significant at most time points
Daily prednisone 	Placebo	Osteocalcin	1467	1641	Daily doses of prednisone up to 60 mg resulted in dose- and time-dependent decreases in plasma osteocalcin, plasma P1NP, serum cortisol, and absolute blood eosinophil counts.
Daily prednisone 	Placebo	Urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen	18876	18995	A significant increase in uNTX normalized for uCr (uNTX/uCr) versus placebo was observed with prednisone 60 mg by Day 2
Daily prednisone 	Placebo	Procollagen type 1 N-propeptide	-1	-1	P1NP was significantly reduced versus placebo with prednisone doses â‰¥20 mg on Day 1 (Fig. 3c). P1NP levels increased slightly relative to placebo on Day 2, and then decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner until Day 8
