Word-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Depressive symptoms 	17090	17282	face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo ABM [Figure 2A; F(2,56) = 3.7, p = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [Figure 2B; F(2,56) < 1, p = .4].
Face-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Anxious symptoms 	18036	18428	Symptoms of anxiety, measured using the trait subscale of the STAI displayed the same specific effect of positive face ABM as that seen for the BDI [Figures 2E, F; F(2,112) = 3.3, p = .05] with the beneficial effect again occurring during follow-up [F(1,28) = 5.2, p = .03] and being driven by a significant reduction of anxious symptoms in the positive face ABM group [t(15) = 2.4, p = .03].
Word-based attentional bias modification	Face-based attentional bias modification	Attentional Function	19325	19702	Positive relative to placebo bias modification produced a differential effect on attentional bias (Figure 4), as measured by the word based visual-probe task [ABM type × time; F(2,112) = 3.1, p = .05]. However, unlike the previous results, this effect did not significantly differ between the face- and word-trained groups [ABM type × ABM stimuli × time; F(2,112) < 1, p = .9].
Face-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Depressive symptoms 	17051	17282	As can be seen from Figure 2 positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo ABM [Figure 2A; F(2,56) = 3.7, p = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [Figure 2B; F(2,56) < 1, p = .4].
Word-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Difference of cortisol on waking and the highest level of following samples	18736	18868	face-based ABM influenced the CAR [Figure 3A; F(2,54) = 4, p = .02], whereas word-based ABM did not [Figure 3B; F(2,52) < 1, p = .8]
Word-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Difference of cortisol on waking and the highest level of following samples	1273	1544	Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response). This effect occurred during the month following completion of bias modification. Word-based modification did not influence the outcome measures.
Word-based attentional bias modification	Placebo	Depressive symptoms 	17051	17282	As can be seen from Figure 2 positive, face-based ABM lead to a reduction of symptoms compared with placebo ABM [Figure 2A; F(2,56) = 3.7, p = .03], whereas word based ABM had no significant effect [Figure 2B; F(2,56) < 1, p = .4].
