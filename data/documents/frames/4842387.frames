BrainPower Advanced capsules 	placebo	audio/visual memory, abstract thinking, memory retrieval, and combined total function test scores	26637	27140	Both the BrainPower Advanced and the placebo groups produced significant improvements (129%–150%) (P < 0.01, each) of the subtests and combined total scores in the older adults, with the BrainPower Advanced group producing better improvements (1.50-, 1.35-, 1.43-, and 1.29-fold relative to the baseline values of audio/visual memory, abstract thinking, memory retrieval, and combined total function test scores) than the placebo group (1.35-, 1.27-, 1.13-, and 1.27-fold, resp.) (Tables 6(a) and 6(b)).
BrainPower Advanced capsules	placebo	Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss (SML)	1230	1420	Advanced intervention, however, improved a greater proportion of the severe SML (29.5%)(13/44) (P < 0.01) and SAD (34.9%)(15/43)(P < 0.01) than placebo (5.1% (2/39) and 13.5% (5/37), resp.).
BrainPower Advanced capsules	placebo	Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss (SML)	22161	22298	Ridit scoring test shows a significant and differential reduction in the SML (mean ± s.d. = 0.418 ± 0.236 versus 0.575 ± 0.299, P < 0.01)
BrainPower Advanced capsules	placebo	combined total scores of the memory function	27142	27416	Ridit scoring test showed that the improvement in the combined total scores of the memory function subtests was significantly better after the BrainPower Advanced intervention (mean = 0.56 ± 0.287) than after the placebo intervention (0.445 ± 0.276) (P < 0.05) (Table 6(c)).
