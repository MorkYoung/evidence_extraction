Cyclophosphamide	Control	IL�6	1217	1323	The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL‐6 after vaccinations,
Cyclophosphamide	Control	IFN�γ spot numbers	15005	15307	The numbers of wells positive for IFN‐γ spots among total wells examined were 16 of 93 (17%) or 16 of 105 (15%) wells in pre‐vaccination PBMC, 23 of 78 (29%) or 20 of 93 (22%) at the 6th vaccination, and 31 of 58 (58%) or 20 of 44 (45%) at the 12th vaccination in the PPV/CPA or PPV alone, respectively
Cyclophosphamide	Control	IL�6	21433	21533	There was a significant difference in plasma IL‐6 between both arms at 12th vaccination (P = 0.006).
Cyclophosphamide	Control	Progression�free survival 	968	1216	The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression‐free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.
Cyclophosphamide	Control	IFN�γ spot numbers	15760	15953	Although not statistically significant (P = 0.334), the increase of IFN‐γ spot numbers per well in the PPV/CPA tended to be greater than that in the PPV alone at the 12th vaccination (Fig. 2a).
Cyclophosphamide	Control	Progression�free survival 	17164	17365	Median PFS time was 6.1 or 2.9 months in the PPV/CPA or PPV alone, respectively (HR 0.427; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.224–0.813; P = 0.008 by log‐rank test and P < 0.001 by Fleming‐Harrington test)
Cyclophosphamide	Control	IL�6	21304	21432	plasma IL‐6 values significantly increased after PPV in the PPV alone (6th, P = 0.010; 12th, P = 0.006), but not in the PPV/CPA.
Cyclophosphamide	Control	Overall survival 	968	1216	The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression‐free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.
Cyclophosphamide	Control	Peptide�specific IgG	16408	16528	However, there were no significant differences in peptide‐specific IgG levels before and after PPV between the two arms.
Cyclophosphamide	Control	IFN�γ spot numbers	15760	15918	Although not statistically significant (P = 0.334), the increase of IFN‐γ spot numbers per well in the PPV/CPA tended to be greater than that in the PPV alone
