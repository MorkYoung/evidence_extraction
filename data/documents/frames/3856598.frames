cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) - bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC)	Control mice	survival	1160	1215	BMDMC therapy led to improved survival in the CLP group
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) - bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC)	Control mice	interleukin-1β	1160	1355	BMDMC therapy led to improved survival in the CLP group, reduced lung elastance, alveolar collapse, tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity, collagen fiber content, and interleukin-1β

cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) - bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC)	Control mice	survival	1160	1516	BMDMC therapy led to improved survival in the CLP group, reduced lung elastance, alveolar collapse, tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity, collagen fiber content, and interleukin-1β and increased chemokine (keratinocyte-derived chemokine and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) expression in lung tissue regardless of the experimental ARDS model.
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) - bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC)	Control mice	alveolar collapse	15784	15935	BMDMC administration led to a reduction in alveolar collapse at days 3 and 7, regardless of the initial insult implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS (
