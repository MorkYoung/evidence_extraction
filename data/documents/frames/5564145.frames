Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Duration of surgery	11414	11507	the difference in surgical time between SC and DC had no statistical significance (P > 0.05).
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Pain during the surgery	1102	1233	The intra-operative pain was higher in the SC group with a significant (P < 0.05) requirement for a supplementary local anesthetic.
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Success rate	928	1034	The DC of 4 % articaine had a significantly higher success rate (83.3%) than did the SC (53.3%; P < 0.05).
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Onset of local anesthesia	11110	11314	Table 2 shows the onset of local anesthesia and there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the groups despite the fact that the DC group had early onset of anesthesia compared to the SC group.
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Duration of soft tissue anesthesia	11315	11404	The duration of anesthesia in DC group was statistically superior to SC group (P < 0.05).
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Duration of surgery	11405	11507	However, the difference in surgical time between SC and DC had no statistical significance (P > 0.05).
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Duration of soft tissue anesthesia	1035	1101	The duration of soft tissue anesthesia was longer in the DC group.
Double cartridges of 4% articaine	Single cartridges of 4% articaine	Success rate	10682	10786	The success rate of the DC versus SC of 4% articaine was statistically significant with a P-value < 0.05
