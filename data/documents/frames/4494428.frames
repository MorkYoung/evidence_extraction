hogs being transported for 6 h - lairaged for 6 h	hogs transported for only 3 h - lairaged for 6 h	Transport duration - effect on serum cortisol concentration	13630	13754	lairaged for 6 h had similar serum cortisol concentrations regardless of transport duration (97.9 vs. 100.5 ng/mL; P = 0.84)
hogs being transported for 6 h	hogs transported for only 3 h	Transport duration - effect on serum cortisol concentration	13202	13406	Transport duration had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on serum cortisol concentration with hogs being transported for 6 h having a greater serum cortisol concentration than hogs transported for only 3 h
hogs being transported for 6 h - lairaged for 3 h	hogs transported for only 3 h - lairaged for 3 h	Transport duration - effect on serum cortisol concentration	13465	13618	greater serum cortisol concentration in pigs transported for 3 h compared to pigs transported 6 h when lairaged for 3 h (93.0 vs. 105.4 ng/mL; P < 0.001)
hogs lairaged for 3 h	hogs lairaged for 6 h	Transport duration in fall season - effect on serum cortisol concentration	13756	13960	Hogs subjected to 3 h of lairage had greater serum cortisol concentrations than hogs subjected to 6 h of lairage in the winter, spring, and fall; however, this was only significant in the fall (P < 0.0001
hogs lairaged for 3 h	hogs lairaged for 6 h	Transport duration in summer season - effect on serum cortisol concentration	13974	14167	In the summer, the opposite was true with hogs subjected to 6 h of lairage having greater serum cortisol concentrations than hogs subjected to 3 h of lairage (122.9 vs. 79.7 ng/mL; P < 0.0001).
hogs being transported for 6 h	hogs transported for only 3 h	Transport duration - effect on serum cortisol concentration	1473	1717	Hogs transported 6 h had increased cortisol concentrations (103.0 vs. 95.5 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and decreased L* (52.49 vs. 52.69; P = 0.09), b* (6.28 vs. 6.36; P = 0.03), and hue angle (20.70 vs. 20.95; P = 0.03) compared to hogs transported 3 h.
