circumcised	uncircumcised	risk scores	29871	30068	There was no statistically significant difference in the risk scores of circumcised and uncircumcised men (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.86–1.38 for logistic and expβ = 1.02, 95% CI 0.99–1.01 for lognormal).
circumcised	uncircumcised	more likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection	21025	21260	In general, the groups were similar, except that uncircumcised men were more likely to be unemployed (χ2 = 16.1, p = 0.01) and circumcised men were more likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (χ2 = 5.6, p = 0.02).
circumcised	uncircumcised	more likely to be unemployed	21074	21147	uncircumcised men were more likely to be unemployed (χ2 = 16.1, p = 0.01)
circumcised	uncircumcised	more likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection	21152	21259	circumcised men were more likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (χ2 = 5.6, p = 0.02)
circumcised	uncircumcised	random effects variance	30647	30856	The random effects variance in both parts of the model was significant (p<0.01 for both) demonstrating that there was heterogeneity among men with respect to engaging in any sexual activity and in risk scores.
circumcised	uncircumcised	increased HIV risk behavior	1791	1849	circumcision did not result in increased HIV risk behavior
circumcised	uncircumcised	more likely to be unemployed	21026	21147	n general, the groups were similar, except that uncircumcised men were more likely to be unemployed (χ2 = 16.1, p = 0.01)
