arthroscopic partial repair	arthroscopic debridement	pain 	1361	1555	All treatment groups had similar pain relief (P = 0.172, F = 1.802) and satisfaction, reflected in equal values of disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score (P = 0.948, F = 0.004).
arthroscopic partial repair	arthroscopic debridement	abduction	1099	1360	The overall Constant score in the partial repair group was superior to the outcome in the debridement group (P < 0.01, F = 8.561), according to better results in abduction (P < 0.01, F = 13.249), activity (P < 0.01, F = 21.391) and motion (P < 0.01, F = 4.967).
arthroscopic partial repair	arthroscopic debridement	pain 	17306	17440	Regarding pain, we found a significant improvement after surgery in the entire series but no differences between the treatment groups.
