GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Time needed to intubate	1257	1366	Intubation time was longer in the GVL group (9.80 ± 1.27 s) than in the MDL group (8.20 ± 1.17 s) (P < 0.05).
GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Mean arterial blood pressure (first 3 minutes)	8627	8751	MAP increase after intubation was significantly higher in the MDL than the GVL group in the first 3 minutes after intubation
GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Mean arterial blood pressure (after 5 minutes)	8763	8847	However, the values returned to pre-intubation levels after 5 minutes in both groups
GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Drop in pulse rate (first 3 minutes)	1367	1474	MAP, pulse rate, and RPP were lower in the GVL than the MDL group after endotracheal intubation (P < 0.05).
GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Increase in Rate pressure product (First 3 minutes)	1367	1473	MAP, pulse rate, and RPP were lower in the GVL than the MDL group after endotracheal intubation (P < 0.05)
GlideScope video-laryngoscope	Macintosh direct laryngoscope	Drop in pulse rate (first 3 minutes)	8976	9211	PR showed a significant drop after induction in both groups. Nevertheless, this was similar in both groups (Table 3). In contrast, after intubation, the changes were more significant in the MDL than the GVL group in the first 3 minutes
