bright white light (10,000 lux), dim red light (< 500 lux) post-treatment	bright white light (10,000 lux), dim red light (< 500 lux) pre-treatment 	eye strain severity	14600	14923	Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant main effect of time on eye strain, F(1, 211) = 32.36, p < .001, d = .47, and blurred vision, F(1, 211) = 7.60, p = .006, d = .19. Across both groups, the average post-treatment eye strain severity (M = .4, SD = 1.0) was greater than pre-treatment severity (M = .1, SD = .5)
bright white light (10,000 lux)	dim red light (< 500 lux)	eye strain, and blurred vision	1023	1335	In other words, bright light exposure was not associated with a significantly higher incidence of any reported side effect than was the placebo control condition. Nevertheless, small but statistically significant increases in both eye strain and blurred vision were observed among both the LT and control groups.
