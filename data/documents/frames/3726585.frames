Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Fasting lipoprotein lipid values	1578	1696	Fasting lipoprotein lipid values were not significantly different between treatments overall, or in subgroup analyses.
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Mean pre-prandial to post-prandial systolic and diastolic blood pressures 	987	1375	Dairy and nondairy treatments did not produce significantly different mean SBP or DBP in the resting postprandial state or from premeal to 3.5 hours postmeal (SBP, 126.3 mmHg versus 124.9 mmHg; DBP, 76.5 mmHg versus 75.7 mmHg), premeal (2.35 versus 2.20) or 2 hours postmeal (2.33 versus 2.30) RHI, and premeal (22.5 versus 23.8) or 2 hours postmeal (12.4 versus 13.2) augmentation index.
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Adverse events	24820	24966	Adverse events were experienced by 9 (12.3%) subjects during the dairy treatment and 12 (16.4%) subjects during the nondairy treatment (P = 0.140)
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Adverse events	24820	24967	Adverse events were experienced by 9 (12.3%) subjects during the dairy treatment and 12 (16.4%) subjects during the nondairy treatment (P = 0.140).
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Pre-meal reactive hyperemia index in individuals with endothelial dysfunction	1376	1577	Among subjects with endothelial dysfunction (RHI â‰¤ 1.67; n = 14) during the control treatment, premeal RHI was significantly higher in the dairy versus nondairy condition (2.32 versus 1.50, P = 0.002).
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Mean pre-prandial to post-prandial systolic and diastolic blood pressures 	987	1355	Dairy and nondairy treatments did not produce significantly different mean SBP or DBP in the resting postprandial state or from premeal to 3.5 hours postmeal (SBP, 126.3 mmHg versus 124.9 mmHg; DBP, 76.5 mmHg versus 75.7 mmHg), premeal (2.35 versus 2.20) or 2 hours postmeal (2.33 versus 2.30) RHI, and premeal (22.5 versus 23.8) or 2 hours postmeal (12.4 versus 13.2)
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Mean resting post-prandial systolic and diastolic blood pressures 	987	1106	Dairy and nondairy treatments did not produce significantly different mean SBP or DBP in the resting postprandial state
Dairy treatment	Nondairy treatment	Fasting lipoprotein lipid values	23923	24123	Fasting lipoprotein lipid (total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and TG) analyses of the overall sample indicated that dairy and nondairy treatments did not produce significantly different lipid responses
