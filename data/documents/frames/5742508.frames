Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Dental plaque	1179	1310	However, the dental plaque on the tooth surface according to the plaque index was 33% higher in the experimental group (p < 0.006).
Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Gingival Brightness	18482	18803	The gingival brightness was taken in each patient using the Micro SpectroShade Optic Research MHT AG. This value was taken at the beginning, middle visit, and in the final visit. The data obtained from these three measurements in each patient showed no statistically significant differences (p values from 0.351 to 0.545)
Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Bleeding	1121	1178	bleeding was lower in the experimental group (p < 0.005).
Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Bleeding	1058	1178	The gingival bleeding index also supports this fact, since the bleeding was lower in the experimental group (p < 0.005).
Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Silness and Löe index	904	1057	The Silness and Löe index was higher in the control group than in the experimental group, reaching a twofold difference between the groups (p < 0.0001).
Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Supplement	Control	Dental plaque	1188	1310	the dental plaque on the tooth surface according to the plaque index was 33% higher in the experimental group (p < 0.006).
