Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Symptoms after exercise	1441	1773	The comparison of the two groups showed that the mean scores of PMS, for symptoms during and after exercise, were significantly different (P ≤ 0.001) and the percentages of scores PMS changes, physical, and psychological symptoms of experimental and control groups had a significant difference (P ≤ 0.001) after 8 weeks of training.

Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Physical symptoms 	13146	13514	physical and psychological symptoms of experimental and control groups after 2 months of training had a significant difference (P ≤ 0.001). As it is shown in Table 2, after 4 weeks of aerobic exercise, overall, 31% of PMS, 29% physical symptoms, and 33% psychological symptoms were reduced, and after 8 weeks this reduction rate became 60%, 65%, and 52%, respectively.
Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Symptoms during exercise	12120	12424	Table 1 shows the effects of aerobic training program on reducing physical and psychological symptoms of PMS in the experimental group. As it can be seen, in this group, mean PMS, physical, and psychological symptoms before, during, and after the intervention showed a significant difference (P ≤ 0.001).
Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Symptoms after exercise	13313	13822	after 4 weeks of aerobic exercise, overall, 31% of PMS, 29% physical symptoms, and 33% psychological symptoms were reduced, and after 8 weeks this reduction rate became 60%, 65%, and 52%, respectively. These findings indicate the impact of aerobic exercise in the first 4 weeks on the reduction of PMS symptoms, i.e., with 4 weeks of aerobic exercise, it can be expected that PMS symptoms be reduced. But the reduction of PMS symptoms after 8 weeks was significant and better than that observed after 4 weeks.
Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Psychological symptoms 	12120	12424	Table 1 shows the effects of aerobic training program on reducing physical and psychological symptoms of PMS in the experimental group. As it can be seen, in this group, mean PMS, physical, and psychological symptoms before, during, and after the intervention showed a significant difference (P ≤ 0.001).
Regular aerobic exercise	Control	Psychological symptoms 	12547	12761	Also, paired t-test showed that the mean PMS, physical, and psychological symptoms in aerobic exercise during exercise was less than that before exercise and it was also lower than that during exercise (P ≤ 0.001).
