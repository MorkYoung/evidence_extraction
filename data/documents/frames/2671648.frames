four visits of a midwife trained in smoking cessation techniques to the home of a smoking pregnant woman	received only a standard written information on the health risk from maternal smoking to the foetus	The effectiveness of smoking cessation attempts (success rate)	19180	19509	The effectiveness of smoking cessation attempts (success rate), measured by the ratio of successful quitters to all who attempted to quit smoking, was 58.3% and 58.6%, respectively in the intervention and control groups (p = 1.0) (Table 4). No differences were found either in the success rate calculated for education subgroups.
