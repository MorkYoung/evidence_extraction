Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increment of the haemoglobin level	2194	2321	The haemoglobin level rose significantly within groups (P < 0.001 for each group) with no difference between groups (P = 0.77).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increase in CD4 T lymphocyte count	2545	2676	with a significantly higher CD4 count in the spirulina group compared to subjects on soya beans at the end of the study (P = 0.02).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Decrease in HIV viral load	2677	2975	Within each group, HIV viral load significantly reduced at the end of the study (P < 0.001 and P = 0.04 for spirulina and soya beans groups respectively). Between the groups, the viral load was similar at baseline but significantly reduced in the spirulina group at the end of the study (P = 0.02).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increase in serum albumin levels	2322	2456	Serum albumin level did not increase significantly within groups (P < 0.90 vs. P < 0.82) with no difference between groups (P = 0.39).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increase in fat free body mass	1865	2193	In terms of body composition, fat free mass (FFM) did not significantly increase within each group (40.5 vs. 42.2 Kg, P = 0.56 for Group A; 39.2 vs. 39.0 Kg, P = 0.22 for Group B). But when compared between the two groups at the end of the trial, FFM was significantly higher in the spirulina group (42.2 vs. 39.0 Kg, P = 0.01).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increase in fat free body mass	2050	2193	when compared between the two groups at the end of the trial, FFM was significantly higher in the spirulina group (42.2 vs. 39.0 Kg, P = 0.01).
Spirulina Platensis	Soya Beans	Increase in CD4 T lymphocyte count	2457	2676	The increase in CD4 cell count within groups was significant (P < 0.01 in both groups), with a significantly higher CD4 count in the spirulina group compared to subjects on soya beans at the end of the study (P = 0.02).
