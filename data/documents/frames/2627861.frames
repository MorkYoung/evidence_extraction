ingest 1,200 mg dietary calcium	ingest placebo	maternal blood lead concentrations in the second/third trimester	1141	1361	Adjusting for baseline lead level, age, trimester of pregnancy, and dietary energy and calcium intake, calcium was associated with an average 11% reduction (0.4 μg/dL) in blood lead level relative to placebo (p = 0.004).
ingest 1,200 mg dietary calcium	ingest placebo	maternal blood lead concentrations	17769	17972	In the intent-to-treat analysis (n = 557), calcium supplementation was associated with an overall average reduction of 11% in maternal blood lead concentrations relative to placebo (p = 0.004) (Table 2).
ingest 1,200 mg dietary calcium	ingest placebo	maternal blood lead concentrations in the second/third trimester	1362	1709	This reduction was more evident in the second trimester (−14%, p < 0.001) than in the third (−8%, p = 0.107) and was strongest in women who were most compliant (those who consumed ≥ 75% calcium pills; −24%, p < 0.001), had baseline blood lead > 5 μg/dL (−17%, p < 0.01), or reported use of lead-glazed ceramics and high bone lead (−31%, p < 0.01).
