paroxetine	placebo	improvement in GHbA1c	12149	12423	After ten weeks we found that the mean decrease of the GHbA1c value in the paroxetine group was 0.44%-units (Table 2). There was a trend towards a more beneficial outcome in the paroxetine group, as GHbA1c in the placebo group decreased only 0.07%-units (U = 9.0, p = 0,08).
