intravenous injection of rhC1INH (50 IU/kg for patients <84 kg, or 4200 IU for patients ≥84 kg)	saline	plasma D-dimer values	13561	13738	Median plasma D-dimer levels were not statistically different between the groups at 2 h (P = 0.8706) and Day 7 (P = 0.9753) after treatment with either rhC1INH or saline (Fig.1)
intravenous injection of rhC1INH (50 IU/kg for patients <84 kg, or 4200 IU for patients ≥84 kg)	saline	Thrombotic/thromboembolic events (TEE) or DVT 	1615	1708	No increased risk of DVT was identified, nor any TEE reported in rhC1INH treated or controls.
intravenous injection of rhC1INH (50 IU/kg for patients <84 kg, or 4200 IU for patients ≥84 kg)	saline	plasma D-dimer values	16310	16512	Of note, severe attacks treated with rhC1INH did tend to have lower plasma D-dimer values (280 [109–925] μg/l) by Day 7 than those treated with saline (560 [273–4056] μg/l; P = 0.1323, not significant).
