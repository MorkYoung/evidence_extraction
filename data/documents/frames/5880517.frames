moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures	nonpainful analogs to these testing procedures	IL-6 responses	-1	-1	during the painful session
moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures	nonpainful analogs to these testing procedures	IL-6 responses	23193	23360	Results revealed a significant main effect of time (B=2.35, standard error [SE]=0.64, p<0.001), indicating that IL-6 responses increased across assessment time points.
moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures	baseline	IL-6 responses	1311	1465	increases in catastrophizing over the course of the QST session were associated with elevated IL-6 responses only during the painful QST session (p<0.05).
moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures	nonpainful analogs to these testing procedures	IL-6 responses	25785	25913	Moreover, no significant differences in IL-6 levels emerged when comparing the painful and nonpainful sessions (p values >0.05).
