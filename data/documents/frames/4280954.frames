high-fat diet enriched with ground flaxseed 15 g/100 g of food, rich in ALA; 	received a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat), deficient in ?-linolenic acid (ALA) 	HDL-C levels	11496	11666	. Flaxseed supplementation significantly decreased serum TC and non-HDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels (Table II) compared with those in the unsupplemented DM group.
high-fat diet enriched with vitamin E, 40 mg ?-tocopherol/100 g of food	received a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat), deficient in ?-linolenic acid (ALA) 	TC, non-HDL-C and TG levels	11667	11829	The addition of vitamin E to the flaxseed-rich diet significantly decreased TC, non-HDL-C and TG levels but did not improved the HDL-C level in diabetic hamsters.
high-fat diet enriched with vitamin E, 40 mg ?-tocopherol/100 g of food	received a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat), deficient in ?-linolenic acid (ALA) 	TC, non-HDL-C and TG levels	18149	18385	In the present study, the addition of vitamin E alone or in combination with flaxseed to the high-fat diet resulted in lower serum concentrations of TC, non-HDL and TG but failed to correct the HDL-C concentrations in diabetic hamsters.
