IND/GLY 110 μg/50 μg	twice-daily SFC 50 μg/500 μg	rate of moderate or severe exacerbations	14769	14960	In the overall pooled population, the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly lower with IND/GLY versus SFC (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.67; P=0.02; Figure 3).
IND/GLY 110 μg/50 μg	twice-daily SFC 50 μg/500 μg	The incidence of pneumonia	15482	15695	The incidence of pneumonia was lower with IND/GLY (IND/GLY, 3 patients; SFC, 14 patients). In a post hoc analysis, the difference in the incidence of pneumonia was found to be statistically significant (P=0.0074).

IND/GLY 110 μg/50 μg	twice-daily SFC 50 μg/500 μg	forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)	13241	13375	Pre-dose trough FEV1 improved significantly with IND/GLY versus SFC in the overall population (treatment difference, 0.10 L; P<0.0001)
IND/GLY 110 μg/50 μg	twice-daily SFC 50 μg/500 μg	rate of moderate or severe exacerbations	14803	14948	the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly lower with IND/GLY versus SFC (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.67; P=0.02
IND/GLY 110 μg/50 μg	twice-daily SFC 50 μg/500 μg	forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)	13241	13527	Pre-dose trough FEV1 improved significantly with IND/GLY versus SFC in the overall population (treatment difference, 0.10 L; P<0.0001) as well as in the GOLD B (treatment difference, 0.10 L; P<0.0001) and GOLD D (treatment difference, 0.08 L; P<0.0001) subgroups of patients (Figure 1).
