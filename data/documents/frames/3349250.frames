Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Quality-of-life scores	-1	-1	However, the mean time spent without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity of treatment (i.e., TWiST) was 151 days higher in the sunitinib than in the IFN-�?± arm (95% CI:
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Duration of median PFS	-1	-1	sunitinib showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with interferon (IFN)-�?±.
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Adverse events	-1	-1	There were more reported occurrences of most general adverse events of all grades in the sunitinib arm than in the IFN-�?± arm
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Quality-adjusted survival times	14104	14294	The difference in scores ranged from 177 to 56 days. Interpreted another way, sunitinib had higher quality-adjusted survival times than IFN-α across the entire range of utility combinations.
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Quality-adjusted survival times	14182	14280	sunitinib had higher quality-adjusted survival times than IFN-α across the entire range of utility
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Quality-of-life scores	12697	12890	Quality-of-life scores as measured by the FACT-G and FKSI questionnaires were higher among patients randomised to sunitinib than among those randomised to IFN-α, with minimal regional variation
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Duration of median PFS	11755	11896	Results from this phase III trial of sunitinib vs IFN-α showed that sunitinib was superior to IFN-α, based on a longer duration of median PFS
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Quality-adjusted survival times	15712	16140	Applying Q-TWiST methodology to examine progression, overall survival, and toxicity as a single metric showed that sunitinib has a greater quality-adjusted survival time than IFN-α. For sunitinib patients, the greater amount of time spent with a toxicity is offset by far longer PFS. These results support the conclusion that sunitinib offers improved clinical and quality-of-life outcomes compared with IFN-α for mRCC patients.
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Overall survival	-1	-1	overall survival was also longer with sunitinib than with IFN-�?±, although the difference did not reach statistical significance
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Overall survival	11898	12025	overall survival was also longer with sunitinib than with IFN-α, although the difference did not reach statistical significance
Sunitinib	Interferon (IFN)-α	Adverse events	9978	10102	There were more reported occurrences of most general adverse events of all grades in the sunitinib arm than in the IFN-α arm
