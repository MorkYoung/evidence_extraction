Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Sway in the A/P direction	-1	-1	Sway in the A/P direction (A/P RMS) was significantly smaller (~1°) for repulsive versus attractive cues (p < 0.001)
Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Sway in the A/P direction	-1	-1	Sway in the A/P direction (A/P RMS) was significantly smaller (~1°) for repulsive versus attractive cues (p < 0.001);
Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Peak A/P tilts for the MCT and ADT perturbations	-1	-1	Peak A/P tilts for the MCT and ADT perturbations (Fig. 3) were significantly smaller for all conditions with repulsive cuing (p = 0.001)
Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Rate of improvement	1622	1696	the rate of improvement was greater for attractive versus repulsive cuing.
Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Time spent in the no feedback zone	-1	-1	Subjects spent slightly more time (~1 %) in the no feedback zone (Time-in-Zone) when using repulsive cues (p < 0.001)
Attractive cuing	Repulsive cuing	Peak A/P tilts for the MCT and ADT perturbations	-1	-1	Peak A/P tilts for the MCT and ADT perturbations (Fig. 3) were significantly smaller for all conditions with repulsive cuing (p = 0.001).
