Ultra fast-track extubation (UFE)	Late extubation 	The length of survival	9263	9382	In survival analysis, there was no significant difference between UFE and LE groups (Log-rank test P = 0.9) [Figure 1].
Ultra fast-track extubation (UFE)	Late extubation 	Length of ICU	1128	1262	Length of ICU stay was significantly higher in late extubation group (4.2 ± 1.2 days) than the UFE group (1.72 ± 1.5 days) (P = 0.02).
Ultra fast-track extubation (UFE)	Late extubation 	The length of survival	1263	1391	In survival analysis there was no significant difference between ultra-fast and late extubation groups (Log-rank test, P = 0.9).
