Aclidinium (ACCORD)	Placebo (ACCORD)	Night-time cough frequency and severity	1541	1682	In ACCORD, aclidinium reduced night-time cough frequency (−0.36 vs 0.1 for placebo; p<0.001) and severity (−0.24 vs −0.1 for placebo; p<0.05)
Aclidinium (active-comparator study)	Placebo (active-comparator study)	Morning cough severity and phlegm	1337	1540	In the active-comparator study, significantly greater improvements were observed with aclidinium versus placebo for severity of morning cough (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.01) and phlegm (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.05).
Aclidinium (active-comparator study)	Placebo (active-comparator study)	E-RS cough/sputum domain scores	1123	1336	E-RS cough/sputum domain scores were significantly reduced with aclidinium 400 μg versus placebo in ATTAIN (−0.7 vs −0.3, respectively; p<0.01) and the active-comparator study (−0.6 vs −0.2, respectively; p<0.01).
Aclidinium 400 μg (ATTAIN)	Placebo (ATTAIN)	E-RS cough/sputum domain scores	20528	20708	Treatment with aclidinium 400 μg significantly reduced total daily COPD symptoms compared with placebo, as assessed by E-RS total score over 24 weeks in ATTAIN (p<0.001; figure 1A)
Aclidinium (ACCORD)	Placebo (ACCORD)	Frequency of sputum production at night-time	1541	1767	In ACCORD, aclidinium reduced night-time cough frequency (−0.36 vs 0.1 for placebo; p<0.001) and severity (−0.24 vs −0.1 for placebo; p<0.05), and frequency of night-time sputum production (−0.37 vs 0.05 for placebo; p<0.001).
Aclidinium 400 μg (ATTAIN)	Placebo (ATTAIN)	E-RS cough/sputum domain scores	1123	1266	E-RS cough/sputum domain scores were significantly reduced with aclidinium 400 μg versus placebo in ATTAIN (−0.7 vs −0.3, respectively; p<0.01)
Aclidinium (active-comparator study)	Placebo (active-comparator study)	Morning cough severity and phlegm	1369	1540	significantly greater improvements were observed with aclidinium versus placebo for severity of morning cough (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.01) and phlegm (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.05).
