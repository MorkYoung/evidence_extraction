control	baseline	any of the scales of the Thai version of the COPSOQ questionnaire	10831	11011	Table 5 also shows that there was no significant difference in any of the scales of the Thai version of the COPSOQ questionnaire before and after intervention in the control group.
ergonomic intervention	baseline	mean scores in work pace, influence at work, meaning of work, predictability, rewards, role conflicts and social support from supervisor 	10465	10768	he paired t-test showed significant differences in mean scores before and after intervention in: work pace (p = 0.002), influence at work (p = 0.005), meaning of work (p = 0.001), predictability (p = 0.001), rewards (p = 0.001), role conflicts (p = 0.001) and social support from supervisor (p = 0.001).
control (did not receive ergonomic training)	baseline	prevalence rates of reported musculoskeletal symptoms	10059	10296	Table 3 shows musculoskeletal symptoms in the control subjects before and after intervention. McNemar test showed no significant difference in the prevalence rates of musculoskeletal symptoms in all regions before and after intervention.
ergonomic intervention	baseline	mean scores in work pace, influence at work, meaning of work, predictability, rewards, role conflicts and social support from supervisor 	10464	10768	The paired t-test showed significant differences in mean scores before and after intervention in: work pace (p = 0.002), influence at work (p = 0.005), meaning of work (p = 0.001), predictability (p = 0.001), rewards (p = 0.001), role conflicts (p = 0.001) and social support from supervisor (p = 0.001).
ergonomic intervention	baseline	prevalence rates of reported musculoskeletal symptoms	9752	10057	The McNemar test indicated significant differences between prevalence rates of reported musculoskeletal symptoms in the arm (p = 0.004), upper back (p = 0.001), and lower back (p = 0.0001) regions before and after intervention. The prevalence rates of problems were significantly lower after intervention.
