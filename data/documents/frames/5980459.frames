famotidine administered at 0.4 mg/kg	saline control	Least square means and standard deviation pH of abomasal outflow fluid	-1	-1	Least square means and standard deviation pH of abomasal outflow fluid from adult cattle (n = 4) administered multiple intravenous doses of 0.4 mg/kg famotidine (circles) every 8 hours (time 0, 8, 16 hours) compared with adult cattle (n = 4) administered an equivalent volume of saline (squares). *Denotes statistical significance (P < .05)
famotidine administered at 0.4 mg/kg	saline control	pH of abomasal outflow fluid for 4 hours	15366	15526	A single dose of famotidine at 0.4 mg/kg significantly increased the pH of abomasal outflow fluid for 4 hours (P < .05) compared with saline control (Figure 3).
famotidine administered at 0.4 mg/kg	saline control	pH of abomasal outflow fluid for 4 hours	1424	1580	Abomasal outflow fluid pH was higher in steers treated with famotidine for up to 4 hours after a single dose but the effect decreased with subsequent doses.
famotidine administered at 0.4 mg/kg	saline control	Least square means and standard deviation pH of abomasal outflow fluid	15366	15514	A single dose of famotidine at 0.4 mg/kg significantly increased the pH of abomasal outflow fluid for 4 hours (P < .05) compared with saline control
