400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	pain intensity	1618	1815	The morphine group reported less pain intensity (evaluated using a visual numeric scale), especially when coughing (18 hours postoperatively: control group= 4.73 and morphine group= 1.80, p=0.001).
400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	The plasma morphine concentration	-1	-1	Plasma morphine levels were zero at the end of surgery in both groups. However, plasma levels were significantly reduced in the morphine group during the postoperative period 24 hours after the operation (control group= 15.87 ± 18.05 ng mL?1 and morphine group 4.08 ± 5.28 ng mL?1, p=0.029),
400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	The plasma morphine concentration	1959	2127	The plasma morphine concentration was also reduced in the morphine group 24 hours after surgery (control group= 15.87 ng.mL−1 and morphine group= 4.08 ng.mL−1, p=0.029)
400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	Cumulative morphine consumption	1817	1958	umulative morphine consumption was reduced after 18 hours in the morphine group (control group= 20.14 and morphine group= 14.20 mg, p=0.037).
400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	Cumulative morphine consumption	1816	1956	Cumulative morphine consumption was reduced after 18 hours in the morphine group (control group= 20.14 and morphine group= 14.20 mg, p=0.037
400 ?g of intrathecal morphine followed by general anesthesia	general anesthesia	forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and PaO2/FiO2 ratio	1324	1617	Both groups experienced reduced FVC postoperatively (3.24 L to 1.38 L in control group; 2.72 L to 1.18 L in morphine FEV1 (p=0.085), group), with no significant decreases observed between groups. The two groups also exhibited similar results for FEV1/FVC (p=0.68) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.08).
