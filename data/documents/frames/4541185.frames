ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	duration of analgesia	1106	1229	The duration of analgesia was also prolonged in patients receiving clonidine (613.10 ± 51.797 min vs. 878.33 ± 89.955 min).
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	duration of sensory and motor block	1007	1105	he duration of both sensory and motor block were significantly prolonged by clonidine (P < 0.001).
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	drop in heart rate	9255	9426	Significantly lower pulse rate was observed from 60 min to 180 min in the clonidine group, but was not clinically significant and did not need any intervention [Figure 1].
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	duration of sensory and motor block	1006	1104	The duration of both sensory and motor block were significantly prolonged by clonidine (P < 0.001)
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	onset of block	9649	9754	The onset of sensory block and motor block was significantly faster in clonidine group than control group
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	drop in mean arterial pressure	1230	1362	Although incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was higher in Group II when compared to Group I, it was not clinically significant
ropivacaine + diluted clonidine with saline	ropivacaine + saline	drop in mean arterial pressure	9428	9646	Mean arterial pressure dropped at 30-min and remained so until 150-min in the clonidine group [Figure 2]. No treatment was required for this fall in blood pressure. The hemodynamic parameters were comparable by 180-min
