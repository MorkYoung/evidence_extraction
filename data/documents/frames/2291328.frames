Bisoprolol	placebo	heart rate, hospital admission, sudden cardiac death, hospital admission for worsening heart failure in CIBIS-II study 	10452	10717	Bisoprolol significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.71 [0.56–0.9]), sudden cardiac death (HR: 0.56 [0.39–0.80]), hospital admission (HR: 0.80 [0.71–0.91]), and hospital admission for worsening heart failure (HR: 0.64 [0.53–0.79]) compared with placebo.
10 mg/day for bisoprolol	20 mg/day for enalapril	mortality in CIBIS-III 	14599	14784	There were fewer deaths in the bisoprolol-first group than in the enalapril-first group, but the difference was not statistically significant (65 vs 73, HR: 0.88 [0.63–1.22], p = 0.44).
bisoprolol	placebo 	mortality in CIBIS trial	7449	7703	During a mean duration of follow-up of 1.9 ± 0.1 years, there were 120 deaths, 67 (20.9%) in the placebo group and 53 (16.6%) in the bisoprolol group (Figure 1). This difference was not statistically significant with a risk reduction of 0.80 (0.56–1.15).
bisoprolol	placebo 	mortality in CIBIS trial	7611	7703	This difference was not statistically significant with a risk reduction of 0.80 (0.56–1.15).
Bisoprolol	placebo	heart rate reduction and blood pressure reduction in CIBIS-II study 	9895	10143	Bisoprolol induced a significant heart rate reduction (of 9.8 ± 14.7 beats/min), with a limited effect on blood pressure (systolic blood pressure reduction of 4.1 ± 16.4 mmHg with bisoprolol but of 2.3 ± 16.4 mmHg with placebo) (Lechat et al 2001).
10 mg/day for bisoprolol	20 mg/day for enalapril	hospitalization hospitalization for worsening CHF in CIBIS-III	14785	15028	There was a non-significant increase in the number of patients having a hospitalization for worsening CHF in the bisoprolol-first group compared with the enalapril-first group (63 vs 51 patients, respectively, HR = 1.25 [0.87–1.81], p = 0.23).
