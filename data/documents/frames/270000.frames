Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	pain score	1713	1908	The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, but compared to Follistim(R), injections of Bravelle(R) were reported by patients to be significantly less painful (P < 0.001).
Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	total dose of FSH administered, the duration of treatment or peak estradiol levels	18390	18546	No significant differences were observed in the total dose of FSH administered, the duration of treatment or peak estradiol levels between groups (Table 2).
Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	chemical, clinical and continuing pregnancies, rate of live birth	1479	1712	Although patients receiving Bravelle(R) consistently reported a greater number of chemical, clinical and continuing pregnancies, as well as an increased rate of live birth, the data did not attain statistical significance (P > 0.05).
Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	adverse events	19445	19787	There were no significant differences in the number of patients reporting adverse events (P = 0.680), severe adverse events (P = 0.307) or serious adverse events (P = 0.161) between the Bravelle® or Follistim® groups. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, abdominal cramps, vaginal bleeding/spotting and nausea (Table 3).
Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	pain score	21110	21316	A two-way ANOVA model used to compare mean daily injection-site pain revealed a significantly lower pain score in Bravelle® patients on most treatment days and during the entire treatment period (P < 0.05).
Bravelle(R) 	Follistim(R	adverse events	1713	1779	The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups
