Group A, 1μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2μg/kg/hr after 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation	11332	11440	The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups (Table 2).
Group A, 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 μg/kg/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The incidence of hypotension	1464	1606	The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01).
Group A, 1μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2μg/kg/hr after 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation	1691	1789	The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups.
Group A, 1μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2μg/kg/hr after 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The mean HR and mean blood pressure (MBP)	11657	11740	he MBP and HR in the PACU were did not statistically differ between the two groups.
Group A, 1μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2μg/kg/hr after 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The mean HR and mean blood pressure (MBP)	11741	11923	The mean HR (Group A vs. Group B, 57.88 ± 6.16 vs. 59.49 ± 8.13, p = 0.133) and MBP (Group A vs. Group B, 80.07 ± 12.48 vs. 77.49 ± 9.36, p = 0.121) were not significantly different.
Group A, 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously 10min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2μg/kg/hr after 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection	The need for treatment of hypotension	1607	1690	The need for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02).
