Vitamin K + supplementation	Supplementation alone	Osteocalcin 	10567	10696	Osteocalcin level was higher in the vitamin K group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.14).
Vitamin K + supplementation	Supplementation alone	Undercarboxylated osteocalcin	1201	1326	UcOC concentration was also significantly decreased in the vitamin K group (-1.6 ± 1.6 ng/dL vs -0.4 ± 1.1 ng/dL, P = 0.008).
Vitamin K + supplementation	Supplementation alone	Mineral density	8982	9166	After 6 months of treatment, the L3 BMD in the vitamin K group compared to the control group increased statistically significantly (0.01 ± 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 ± 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049)
Vitamin K + supplementation	Supplementation alone	Mineral density	1027	1200	L3 bone mineral density has increased statistically significantly in the vitamin K group compared to the control group (0.01 ± 0.03 g/cm2 vs -0.008 ± 0.04 g/cm2, P = 0.049).
