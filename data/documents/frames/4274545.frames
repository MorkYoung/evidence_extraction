prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	Hospitalization time	1495	1608	duration of hospitalization was meaningfully shorter in the prebiotic group (16 [9-45] vs. 25 [11-80]; P - 0.004]
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	incidence of suspected Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)	15416	15627	Only one neonate (4.0%), in the prebiotic group developed NEC, as compared to 11 infants (22.0%) who had not received SCGOS/LCFOS mixture [HR: 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-0.84); P - 0.002; Table 2].
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	Mortality	17704	17806	Mortality was similar between the two groups; only one neonate died in each group [P - 0.66; Table 1].
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	sepsis	16261	16503	Four neonates (16%) in the prebiotic group suffered from sepsis, but 17 infants (34%) who had not received SCGOS/LCFOS mixture developed sepsis, although the difference was not statistically significant [HR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.27-2.72); P = 0.79
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	time of reaching full volume of milk	16626	16822	The median (range) time of reaching full enteral feeds (150 ml/kg/day) in group P was 11 (7-21) days (95% CI: 10.69-13.14) and in group C, 14 (8-36) days (95% CI: 13.17-16.50) [P - 0.02; Table 1].
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	incidence of suspected Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)	1248	1415	SCGOS/LCFOS mixture significantly reduced the incidence of suspected NEC, (1 [4.0%] vs. 11 [22.0%]; hazard ratio: 0.49 [95% confidence interval: 0.29-0.84]; P = 0.002)
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	Hospitalization time	16085	16260	The median (range) of hospital stay time was 16 (9-45) days (95% CI: 15.34-24.09) and 25 (11-80) days (95% CI: 25.52-34.39) in group P and C respectively (P - 0.004; Table 1].
prebiotic mixture (SCGOS/LCFOS; 9:1)	not receive any prebiotic	sepsis	16261	16514	Four neonates (16%) in the prebiotic group suffered from sepsis, but 17 infants (34%) who had not received SCGOS/LCFOS mixture developed sepsis, although the difference was not statistically significant [HR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.27-2.72); P = 0.79; Table 2].
