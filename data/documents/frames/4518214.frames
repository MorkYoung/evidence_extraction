chemoradiotherapy 	radiotherapy alone	overall survival (OS) in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)	10752	10865	The true study endpoint, 5-year OS, was 62% in the RT group and 72% in the CRT group (Plog-rank = 0.038; Fig. 1).
chemoradiotherapy 	radiotherapy alone	overall survival (OS) in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)	10752	11013	The true study endpoint, 5-year OS, was 62% in the RT group and 72% in the CRT group (Plog-rank = 0.038; Fig. 1). The adjusted HR for CRT was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.44â€“0.97; PCox = 0.036). This translates to a 34% relative reduction in deaths after CRT compared to RT.
