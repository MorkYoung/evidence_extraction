Inhaled human activated protein C + IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	Blood temperature	13790	13873	Blood temperature increased in all groups, including sham-operated sheep (P = 0.02)
Inhaled human activated protein C + IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	pH	14151	14350	Except for a slight increase in pH (P = 0.002) and a decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2; P = 0.013) after inhaled APC, we noticed no changes in acid-base balance.
Inhaled human activated protein C + IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	Venous oxygen saturation	13601	13789	oxygen saturation (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) both improved significantly on inhalation of APC, but without significant intergroup differences compared with LPS alone.
Inhaled human activated protein C + IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	Oxygen saturation	13601	13789	oxygen saturation (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) both improved significantly on inhalation of APC, but without significant intergroup differences compared with LPS alone.
Inhaled human activated protein C + IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	IV ovine lipopolysaccharide	Blood temperature	13962	14150	An early increase in haemoglobin concentration was observed in both LPS groups (P < 0.001). Inhaled APC displayed no significant effects on the changes in haemoglobin or blood temperature.
