LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	decrease in Geriatric Depression Scale Score - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	15574	15782	There was also a decrease in Geriatric Depression Scale Score in both the AC and the LISTEN group; however, this decrease was not statistically significant within either group (AC-p = 0.229, LISTEN-p = 0.109)
LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	decrease in UCLA loneliness scores across 17 weeks - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	15299	15558	While subjects enrolled in the LISTEN group appeared to have a greater decrease in UCLA loneliness scores across 17 weeks compared to subjects in the AC group, this reduction was not statistically significant (AC = −4.9 ± 6.3, LISTEN = −5.4 ± 7.15, p = 0.856)
LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	decrease in BMI - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	17098	17303	While subjects in both the AC and the LISTEN group showed a decrease in BMI, this decrease was not statistically significant in either group (AC-p = 0.251, LISTEN-p = 0.498), nor between groups (p = 0.396)
LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	change in IL6 expression at 17 weeks - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	17678	17868	Neither subjects enrolled in LISTEN groups nor attention control showed a change in IL6 expression at 17 weeks (AC IL6 Fold Change = 1.2 ± 1.3, LISTEN IL2 Fold Change = 1.3 ± 1.1, p = 0.731)
LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	systolic blood pressure - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	16698	16882	There was a considerable reduction in systolic blood pressure in the LISTEN group compared to the AC group at 17 weeks (no intervention = −1.4 ± 12.5, LISTEN = −11.1 ± 13.8, p = 0.013)
LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention)	AC (attention control) group (healthy aging education)	decrease in Geriatric Depression Scale Score - older, lonely, chronically ill adults	15574	15814	There was also a decrease in Geriatric Depression Scale Score in both the AC and the LISTEN group; however, this decrease was not statistically significant within either group (AC-p = 0.229, LISTEN-p = 0.109), nor between groups (p = 0.448)
