Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Genitourinary acute toxicity severity	984	1125	There was no difference between H-ARM versus C-ARM for severity and incidence in genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicity.
Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Genitourinary acute toxicity incidence	1308	1465	For acute GU toxicity no difference was detected between H-ARM (grade 0–3; 22.3%, 54.5%, 18.7% and 4.5%) and C-ARM (grade 0–3; 25.8%, 53.3%, 17.1% and 3.8%).
Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Gastrointestinal acute toxicity severity 	1306	1465	. For acute GU toxicity no difference was detected between H-ARM (grade 0–3; 22.3%, 54.5%, 18.7% and 4.5%) and C-ARM (grade 0–3; 25.8%, 53.3%, 17.1% and 3.8%).

Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Gastrointestinal acute toxicity incidence	1126	1465	During the treatment comparing H-ARM with C-ARM no differences was observed for GI toxicity (grade 0–3; H-ARM = 45.5%, 34%, 18.7% and 1.8% versus C-ARM = 47.6%, 35.2%, 17.2% and 0). For acute GU toxicity no difference was detected between H-ARM (grade 0–3; 22.3%, 54.5%, 18.7% and 4.5%) and C-ARM (grade 0–3; 25.8%, 53.3%, 17.1% and 3.8%).
Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Gastrointestinal acute toxicity incidence	12250	12473	The majority of the patients tolerated the treatment well without major acute GI or GU side effects during the treatment (47.6% in C-Arm and 45.5% in H-arm for GI toxity and 25.8% in C-Arm versus 22.3% H-Arm for GU toxicity
Hypofractionation conformal treatment 	Conventional schedule	Genitourinary acute toxicity severity	984	1124	There was no difference between H-ARM versus C-ARM for severity and incidence in genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicity
