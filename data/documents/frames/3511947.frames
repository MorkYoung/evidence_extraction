Fentanyl and neostigmine (group III)	Normal saline (group I)	Complete analgesia and effective analgesia duration	1724	1893	The durations of complete analgesia and effective analgesia were longer for all patients in group III compared with group II (P < 0.05) and group I (P < 0.005) patients.
Fentanyl and neostigmine (group III)	Fentanyl and normal saline (group II)	24-h visual analog score	11460	11629	overall 24-h VAS score in patients who received the combination of fentanyl with neostigmine was significantly less than in those who received fentanyl alone (P = 0.00).
Fentanyl and normal saline (group II)	Normal saline (group I)	Need of rescue analgesia	1894	2059	The total number of epidural top ups (rescue analgesia) required was less in group II (P < 0.05) and group III (P < 0.005) patients, compared with the control group.
Fentanyl and neostigmine (group III)	Normal saline (group I)	Need of rescue analgesia	11902	12084	The total number of epidural top ups (rescue analgesia) required was less in the fentanyl group (P < 0.05) and fentanylâ€“neostigmine group (P < 0.005) compared with the control group.
