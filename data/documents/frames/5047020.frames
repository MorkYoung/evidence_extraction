Hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven)	Normal saline	Level of base excess after therapy	841	1116	In hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) and normal saline groups, base excess level after solution therapy increased about 9.65 and 5.46 volumes, respectively, in which augmentation in hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) group is significantly higher than normal saline group (P ≤ 0.001).
Hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven)	Normal saline	Baseline level of base excess, age and sex of the patients	-1	-1	Comparing the age and sex of the patients, no significant difference was seen.Mean level of base excess before fluid therapy in Voluven group was 76 (1.56 ± 0) and in normal saline group was 33 (0.6 ± 0.33). Given the statistical analysis, there was no significant difference between average levels of base excess before fluid therapy in both groups (P = 0.082).
Hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven)	Normal saline	Incidence of adverse events	10307	10402	Besides, in neither of the two groups, adverse reaction to the received solutions was observed.
