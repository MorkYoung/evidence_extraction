Iron polymaltose complex (IPC), ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	baseline	improvement in Hb by month 1	8596	8793	A significant improvement in Hb was observed by month 1 in the IPC group (9.5 ± 1.1 g/dL to 10.6 ± 1.0 g/dL, P = 0.001) and the ferrous sulfate group (9.4 ± 1.6 g/dL to 11.2 ± 0.9 g/dL, P = 0.001),
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC)	ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	percentage of reticulocytes at day 7	8293	8415	The percentage of reticulocytes at day 7 was similar with IPC (1.41 ± 1.31%) and ferrous sulfate (1.57 ± 1.29%; P = 0.905)
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC)	ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	percentage of reticulocytes at day 7	8293	8416	The percentage of reticulocytes at day 7 was similar with IPC (1.41 ± 1.31%) and ferrous sulfate (1.57 ± 1.29%; P = 0.905).
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC), ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	baseline	serum ferritin level by month 4	9509	9692	The increase in serum ferritin level from baseline to month 4 was almost twofold lower in the IPC group versus ferrous sulfate (22.7 ± 26.1 μg/mL versus 42.5 ± 62.0 μg/mL, P = 0.001).
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC), ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	baseline	improvement in Hb by month 4	8794	8952	with an increase of more than 2 g/dL in both treatment arms by month 4 (IPC 11.7 ± 0.8 g/dL, ferrous sulfate 12.4 ± 1.0 g/dL; both P = 0.001 versus baseline).
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC), ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	baseline	improvement in Hb by month 1	557	691	Mean increases in Hb to months 1 and 4 with IPC were 1.2 ± 0.9 g/dL and 2.3 ± 1.3 g/dL, respectively, (both P = 0.001 versus baseline)
Iron polymaltose complex (IPC), ferrous sulfate twice daily, (both 5 mg iron/kg/day)	baseline	improvement in Hb by month 4	557	691	Mean increases in Hb to months 1 and 4 with IPC were 1.2 ± 0.9 g/dL and 2.3 ± 1.3 g/dL, respectively, (both P = 0.001 versus baseline)
