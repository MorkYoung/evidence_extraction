Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT)	Control	Baseline chaacteristics	15193	15427	After performing the chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test to examine the preliminary homogeneity of baseline variables between the two groups, both groups were found to be homogeneous as there was no significant difference (p>0.05)
Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT)	Control	Visual analogue scale score improvement	768	880	VAS scores improved post-intervention and at the 2-week and 4-week follow-up in the intervention group (p<0.05).
Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT)	Control	Constant-Murley score	16745	16941	Differences in the CS between baseline and post-intervention, 2-week follow-up, and 4-week follow-up in the intervention and control groups were slightly increased without statistical significance
Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT)	Control	Visual analogue scale score improvement	768	1049	VAS scores improved post-intervention and at the 2-week and 4-week follow-up in the intervention group (p<0.05). Respective differences in VAS scores between baseline and post-intervention in the intervention and control groups were –1.69±1.90 and –0.45±0.79, respectively (p<0.05)
