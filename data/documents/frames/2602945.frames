on-time patients	late patients	exam room utilization time	1042	1267	Exam room utilization was lower for late patients (28.9% versus 44.7%, P = .03) with physician utilization lower in clinics with 3 or more late patients when compared to clinics with 2 or fewer (59.7% versus 68.7%, P = .004).
on time patient	late patient	time spent with the physician	729	1041	On-time patients were found to have a longer wait time once in the exam room for the physician than those that were late (14.8 ± 9.2 minutes versus 11.0 ± 8.4 minutes, P = .005); however, those patients spent a significantly longer time with the physician (10.7 ± 6.0 minutes versus 8.9 ± 5.8 minutes, P = .041).
new patient	return patient	exam room utilization time	4995	5159	The overall exam room utilization ratio was 32.5% and did not <NEWLINE>significantly differ between on-time and late patients (P = .067) or new <NEWLINE>and return patients (P = .35)
on time patient	late patient	time spent with the physician	-1	-1	on-time patients spent a significantly longer time with the physician in the exam room (10.7 ± 6.0 minutes versus 8.9 ± 5.8 minutes, P = .041)
on-time patient	late patient	patient wait time for physician arrival once in the exam room	4639	4829	On-time patients were found <NEWLINE>to have a statistically longer wait time once in the exam room for the <NEWLINE>physician than those who were late (14.8 ± 9.2 minutes versus 11.0 ± 8.4 minutes, P = .005)
patients who came on time	patients who came late	Utilization of Physician time	5333	5510	physician utilization was <NEWLINE>significantly lower in clinics with greater than 2 late patients when compared <NEWLINE>to clinics with 2 or fewer late patients (59.7% versus 68.7%, P = 0.004)
patients who came on time	patients who came late	Utilization of Physician time	-1	-1	The overall exam room utilization ratio was 32.5% and did not significantly differ between on-time and late patients (P = .067) or new and return patients (P = .35) (Table 4). When new patients were stratified as late or on-time, exam room utilization was significantly lower for late patients (28.9% versus 44.7%, P = .03). Furthermore, physician utilization was significantly lower in clinics with greater than 2 late patients when compared to clinics with 2 or fewer late patients (59.7% versus 68.7%, P = 0.004) (Table 5).
on-time patient	late patient	patient wait time for physician arrival once in the exam room	729	907	On-time patients were found to have a longer wait time once in the exam room for the physician than those that were late (14.8 ± 9.2 minutes versus 11.0 ± 8.4 minutes, P = .005);
