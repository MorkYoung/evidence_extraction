recreationally endurance trained - men	baseline	rate of force development (RFD)	17916	18072	The absolute rate of force development (RFD) decreased during both loadings in ES and SE men (at post −19±18%, p<0.001 and −33±28%, p = 0.003, respectively,
recreationally endurance trained - men	recreationally endurance trained - women	Maximal bilateral isometric strength (MVC)	16987	17139	Absolute maximal bilateral isometric (MVC) strength in ES men decreased significantly following E (−8±7%, p = 0.002 at MID) but not in women (Figure 1).
recreationally endurance trained - men	baseline	rate of force development (RFD)	17916	18083	The absolute rate of force development (RFD) decreased during both loadings in ES and SE men (at post −19±18%, p<0.001 and −33±28%, p = 0.003, respectively, Figure 2).
recreationally endurance trained - men	baseline	serum concentrations of testosterone	18532	18812	The relative change in testosterone concentrations of men from pre were similar at mid and post of ES and SE, while at 24 h and 48 h of recovery the relative change from pre in SE was significantly lower than the relative change from pre in ES (p<0.05 at 24 h and 48 h, Figure 3).
recreationally endurance trained - women	baseline	serum concentrations of testosterone	18813	19085	The relative changes in serum testosterone concentrations in women were similar from pre to mid, but the change in SE was significantly greater than in ES at post (p<0.05). At 24 h and 48 h of recovery in women, the relative changes from pre in both ES and SE were similar
recreationally endurance trained - men	baseline	growth hormone (GH)	19985	20130	In men, the magnitude of growth hormone increase observed between pre and post was significantly greater following SE than ES (p<0.001, Figure 5)
recreationally endurance trained - men	baseline	Serum cortisol	23046	23086	Serum cortisol remained unaltered in men
recreationally endurance trained - women	baseline	serum concentrations of testosterone	22969	23045	No changes were observed in morning concentrations of testosterone in women.
