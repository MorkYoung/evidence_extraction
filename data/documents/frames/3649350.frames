group A, who were allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	group B, who were NOT allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	severe and moderate pain	10026	10260	ajority of patients from group B, who did not view the procedures, were in severe and moderate pain categories. In contrast, majority of patients in group A who did view the procedures were in the categories of mild or no pain at all.
group A, who were allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	group B, who were NOT allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	pulse rate before the procedures	9063	9204	The pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures before the procedures were also found to be comparable for both groups of patients.
group A, who were allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	group B, who were NOT allowed to observe DJ stent insertion	severe and moderate pain	9505	9696	The mean pain score experienced by the patients from group B (who could not view the procedures) is almost four times higher than the mean pain score of group A (who did view the procedures).
