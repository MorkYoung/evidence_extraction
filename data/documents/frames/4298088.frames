i-gel prewarmed to 42°C; W group	(i-gel kept at room temperature; C group;	sealing pressure	10274	10470	After successful insertion, the sealing pressure was slightly, but not significantly, higher in the W group than in the C group (W group 22.6±6.1 cm H2O; C group 20.7±6.1 cm H2O; p=0.15; table 2).
i-gel prewarmed to 42°C; W group	(i-gel kept at room temperature; C group;	Insertion was successful with one attempt	995	1077	Insertion was successful with one attempt in 35 cases each for the W and C groups.
i-gel prewarmed to 42°C; W group	(i-gel kept at room temperature; C group;	The number of successful ventilations in the first trial	10103	10273	There was also one failure case in the C group. The number of successful ventilations in the first trial did not significantly differ between the W and C groups (p=0.51).
