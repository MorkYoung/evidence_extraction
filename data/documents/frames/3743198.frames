Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Rate of certain diagnosis	17558	17689	There was an increasing trend in the rate of certain diagnosis in the intervention group, but it was not statistically significant.
Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Admission rate	1137	1271	The admission rate decreased by 8.3% in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.70, p=0.005).
Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Medical costs	17142	17345	In the multivariate linear regression analysis of medical costs, membership in the intervention group was associated with decreased costs (coefficient -712000 KRW, 95% CI -1341000 to -83000 KRW, p=0.027)
Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Postural blood pressure measurement	15658	15800	Postural blood pressure measurement was more frequently performed in the intervention group than the control group (97.6% vs. 87.9%, p=0.003).
Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Medical costs	16730	17356	There was a substantial cost reduction of about 30% in the intervention period (369000 KRW, IQR 240000-602000 KRW), compared with the control period (542000 KRW, IQR 316000-1185000 KRW). This difference was especially prominent when we compared the costs paid by low- or intermediate-risk patients, the costs at the ED, the costs paid by patients revisiting the OPD and the costs for diagnostic tests (Table 4). In the multivariate linear regression analysis of medical costs, membership in the intervention group was associated with decreased costs (coefficient -712000 KRW, 95% CI -1341000 to -83000 KRW, p=0.027) (Table 5).
Educational program and ED protocol for syncope evaluation	No standardized guidelines or educational programs	Cardiac enzymes and electroencephalography testing	15810	15989	the use of cardiac enzymes and electroencephalography were lower in the intervention group than the control group, respectively (42.9% vs. 56.0%, p=0.041; 2.3% vs. 8.6%, p=0.029).
