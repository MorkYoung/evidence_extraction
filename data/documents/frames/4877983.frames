ACT intervention	control	overall neonatal mortality	14652	14825	During the trial, the overall neonatal mortality was lower in the intervention clusters, but not significantly so (21.7/1000 vs 26.1/1000, RR 0.88 (0.73, 1.06), p = 0.1875).
ACT intervention	control	overall neonatal mortality	14441	14825	The overall neonatal mortality was similar in the intervention and control clusters prior to the trial (not surprising since the clusters were randomized in part based on the pretrial neonatal mortality rates). During the trial, the overall neonatal mortality was lower in the intervention clusters, but not significantly so (21.7/1000 vs 26.1/1000, RR 0.88 (0.73, 1.06), p = 0.1875).
