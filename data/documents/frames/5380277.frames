Heated infusions 	Control	Extubation time 	11247	11433	Additionally, the mean time to extubation in the control group was significantly longer than that in the warming infusion group (11.13 ± 1.34 minutes vs 10.09 ± 1.91 minutes, P = 0.015).
Heated infusions 	Control	Surgery time 	10311	10522	However, the operation time of patients who received fluid kept at room temperature was significantly longer than that of patients who received warmed infusion (3.094 ± 0.254 min vs 2.925 ± 0.216 min, P < 0.05).
Heated infusions 	Control	Blood loss	10117	10310	As shown in Table 2, no significant difference was observed in terms of blood loss, transfusion volume, and blood transfusion volume between control group and warming infusion group (P > 0.05).
Heated infusions 	Control	Eye opening time 	10859	11246	Patients from the control group presented longer time to spontaneous breath, eye opening, and consciousness recovery than patients from the warming infusion group (spontaneous breath, 4.47 ± 0.84 minutes vs 4.06 ± 0.72 minutes, P = 0.042; eye opening, 8.66 ± 2.03 minutes vs 6.72 ± 1.73 minutes, P < 0.001; consciousness recovery, 11.19 ± 1.49 minutes vs 9.91 ± 1.91 minutes, P = 0.004).
Heated infusions 	Control	Blood loss	10138	10310	no significant difference was observed in terms of blood loss, transfusion volume, and blood transfusion volume between control group and warming infusion group (P > 0.05).
Heated infusions 	Control	Consciousness recovery time 	10859	11246	Patients from the control group presented longer time to spontaneous breath, eye opening, and consciousness recovery than patients from the warming infusion group (spontaneous breath, 4.47 ± 0.84 minutes vs 4.06 ± 0.72 minutes, P = 0.042; eye opening, 8.66 ± 2.03 minutes vs 6.72 ± 1.73 minutes, P < 0.001; consciousness recovery, 11.19 ± 1.49 minutes vs 9.91 ± 1.91 minutes, P = 0.004).
Heated infusions 	Control	Hospital stay time 	11434	11516	No significant difference was found in length of hospital stay between the groups.
Heated infusions 	Control	Spontaneous breath time 	10859	11246	Patients from the control group presented longer time to spontaneous breath, eye opening, and consciousness recovery than patients from the warming infusion group (spontaneous breath, 4.47 ± 0.84 minutes vs 4.06 ± 0.72 minutes, P = 0.042; eye opening, 8.66 ± 2.03 minutes vs 6.72 ± 1.73 minutes, P < 0.001; consciousness recovery, 11.19 ± 1.49 minutes vs 9.91 ± 1.91 minutes, P = 0.004).
