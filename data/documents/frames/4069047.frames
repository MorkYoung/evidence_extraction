Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	MMSE cognitive performance 	1476	1645	Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044)
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	Neuropsychiatric Inventory score at week 24	20968	21143	A statistically significant difference in NPI distress score was observed between the groups at week 24 (P=0.026). NPI distress scores increased significantly in the PRM group
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	Adverse events 	22607	22834	Drug-related AEs were reported by eight patients (20.5%) in the PRM and by two (5.9%) in the placebo cohort, with no statistical difference between the two groups (post hoc analysis) (chi-squared Fisher's exact test, P=0.0933).
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index sleep efficiency	1696	1787	Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017).
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	IADL cognitive performance 	1476	1645	Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044)
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	Neuropsychiatric Inventory score at week 24	20968	21269	A statistically significant difference in NPI distress score was observed between the groups at week 24 (P=0.026). NPI distress scores increased significantly in the PRM group between baseline and week 24 (3.1±7.59) (P=0.033) and decreased nonsignificantly in the placebo group (−0.24±4.17) (P=0.758).
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	Adverse events 	2120	2265	Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	IADL cognitive performance 	1476	1646	Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).
Prolonged-release melatonin	Placebo	MMSE cognitive performance 	1476	1646	Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044).
