Preoperative oxygen delivery	Protocolized standard of care	Minimal creatinine rise	-1	-1	Similar proportions of patients who developed MCR were present in each haemodynamic therapy group (P = 0.92; Table 1)
Preoperative oxygen delivery	Protocolized standard of care	Decrease in serum creatinine	-1	-1	Postoperative reductions in serum creatinine were similar (P = 0.76) in patients randomized to GDT [10 μmol L−1 (95% CI: 17 to −1)] and protocolized care [8 μmol/L (95% CI: 17 to −6)

Preoperative oxygen delivery	Protocolized standard of care	Markers of systemic inflammation	16192	16279	Markers of systemic inflammation were similar between groups (Supplementary Figure S2).
Preoperative oxygen delivery	Protocolized standard of care	AKI development	16022	16191	Six out of 95 patients developed AKI in the haemodynamic therapy group whereas 7/92 patients sustained AKI in the control group [RR: 1.21 (95% CI: 0.42–3.45); P = 0.77].
