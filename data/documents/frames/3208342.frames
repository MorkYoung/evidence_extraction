Low-frequency right prefrontal followed by low-frequency left temporal rTMS	Only low-frequency left temporal rTMS 	Response rate	1519	1784	Directly after therapy there was a significant improvement of the TQ-score in both groups. Comparison of both groups revealed a trend toward more pronounced effects for the combined group (effect size: Cohen's d = 0.176), but this effect did not reach significance.
