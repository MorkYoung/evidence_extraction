performed 3 short bouts of exercise (Short-bouts group: 10 min × 3) 3 d per week	baseline	HDL-C, VO2max, DBP. SBP	-1	-1	The Short-bouts group demonstrated significant increases in VO2max after 10 weeks and in HDL-C after 20 weeks, whereas the DBP after both 10 and 20 wk and the SBP after 20 wk had significantly increased (Table 2).
performed a single period of continuous exercise (Long-bout group: 30 min × 1) 3 d per week,	performed 3 short bouts of exercise (Short-bouts group: 10 min × 3) 3 d per week	Waist circumference, HDL-C, VO2max, and TBARS	13444	13634	As shown in Table 2, comparison [p (time × <NEWLINE>group)] between the long and short bouts of exercise showed no significant difference in <NEWLINE>the effects of the interventions on the overall variables.
performed a single period of continuous exercise (Long-bout group: 30 min × 1) 3 d per week,	baseline	lasma levels of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances)	1150	1297	Plasma TBARS significantly decreased after 20 weeks in <NEWLINE>the Long-bout group and tended to decrease (but not significantly) in the Short-bouts <NEWLINE>group.
performed a single period of continuous exercise (Long-bout group: 30 min × 1) 3 d per week,	performed 3 short bouts of exercise (Short-bouts group: 10 min × 3) 3 d per week	Waist circumference, HDL-C, VO2max, and TBARS	-1	-1	As shown in Table 2, comparison [p (time × group)] between the long and short bouts of exercise showed no significant difference in the effects of the interventions on the overall variables. Moreover, the ES (f 2) values for VO2max, TC, and HDL-C were also below the medium level (0.15). Waist circumference, HDL-C, VO2max, and TBARS significantly improved in all subjects over the 20 wk, whereas diastolic blood pressure significantly increased [p (time) in Table 2].
performed a single period of continuous exercise (Long-bout group: 30 min × 1) 3 d per week,	baseline	lasma levels of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances)	-1	-1	Plasma levels of TBARS significantly decreased after 20 wk in the Long-bout group (Table 2).
