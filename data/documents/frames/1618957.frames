lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg	lanreotide microparticles	growth hormone	1342	1476	Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel® than with lanreotide microparticles (3·8 (0·5) vs 4·3 (0·5) ng/ml; P < 0·001).
lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg	lanreotide microparticles	symptom control	17666	17785	Overall, greater symptom control was noted at the end of treatment with Lan ATG 120 mg than with Lan MP 30 mg (Fig. 2).
lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg	lanreotide microparticles	Plasma concentrations of IGF-1	15122	15436	Plasma concentrations of IGF-1 did not change significantly over the course of the study. During treatment with Lan MP 30 mg, the mean plasma concentration of IGF-1 was 423 ± 30 ng/ml in men and 336 ± 24 ng/ml in women, compared with 414 ± 32 in men and 314 ± 23 ng/ml in women after treatment with Lan ATG 120 mg.
