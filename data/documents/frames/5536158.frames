ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose	ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose	Systolic blood pressure reduction	12734	12871	The reduction in systolic blood pressure showed no major differences between the two groups (Fixed: 7.64±2.49 vs Free: 7.81±4.00%, n.s.),
ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose	ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose	Diastolic blood pressure reduction	1480	1606	while the reduction of diastolic blood pressure was greater in the Fixed group (Fixed: 14.22±2.03%; Free: 4.92±5.00%, p<0.05).
ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose	ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose	Reaching blood pressure target	1182	1367	After 3 months BP control was improved in both groups and BP targets were similarly reached in both groups (SBP; Fixed: 61.54%; Free 69.23%; n.s. DPB; Fixed: 80.77%; Free 84.62%; n.s.).
ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose	ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose	Diastolic blood pressure reduction	1368	1606	The reduction in systolic blood pressure was similar in both groups (Fixed:7.64±2.49%; Free: 7.81±4.00%, n.s.), while the reduction of diastolic blood pressure was greater in the Fixed group (Fixed: 14.22±2.03%; Free: 4.92±5.00%, p<0.05).
