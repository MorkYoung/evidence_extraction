PEG–lactulose group received the 20-30 grams of lactulose of oral or rectal lactulose, plus 280 grams of PEG in 4 liters of water orally as a single dose in 30-120 minutes 	20-30 grams of lactulose orally or by a nasogastric tube, or 200 grams of lactulose enema by a rectal tube	Hepatic Encephalopathy Scoring Algorithm (HESA) score	13470	13593	In comparison with lactulose alone, PEG-lactulose could improve HESA score in 24 hours more effectively (p =0.04, table 3).
PEG–lactulose group received the 20-30 grams of lactulose of oral or rectal lactulose, plus 280 grams of PEG in 4 liters of water orally as a single dose in 30-120 minutes	20-30 grams of lactulose orally or by a nasogastric tube, or 200 grams of lactulose enema by a rectal tube	blood level of ammonia	14150	14276	There was no significant change in the blood level of ammonia after 24 hours between the treatment groups (p =0.858, table 3).
PEG–lactulose group received the 20-30 grams of lactulose of oral or rectal lactulose, plus 280 grams of PEG in 4 liters of water orally as a single dose in 30-120 minutes	20-30 grams of lactulose orally or by a nasogastric tube, or 200 grams of lactulose enema by a rectal tube	length of hospital stay	1126	1401	Overall, PEG-lactulose regimen was associated with a decrease in length of hospital stay compared with lactulose treatment (p =0.03) but in subgroup analysis we found that PEG-lactulose regimen could only decrease the length of hospital stay in women significantly (p =0.01).
PEG–lactulose group received the 20-30 grams of lactulose of oral or rectal lactulose, plus 280 grams of PEG in 4 liters of water orally as a single dose in 30-120 minutes	20-30 grams of lactulose orally or by a nasogastric tube, or 200 grams of lactulose enema by a rectal tube	length of hospital stay	1135	1258	PEG-lactulose regimen was associated with a decrease in length of hospital stay compared with lactulose treatment (p =0.03)
