Albendazole	Placebo	Total concentration of IgG1 and IgG3	23321	23598	The total concentration of the subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 were slightly elevated in the antihelminthic treated group (for IgG1 p-value was 0.042 and for IgG3 p-value was 0.03 in the model-based analysis, but was not significant using the Wilcoxon-test (p-value 0.347 and 0.160)).
Albendazole	Placebo	Levels of vaccine-specific IgA	23742	23845	no difference of vaccine-specific IgA was detected between the antihelminthic treated and control group
Albendazole	Placebo	Levels of vaccine-specific IgA	23742	23854	no difference of vaccine-specific IgA was detected between the antihelminthic treated and control group (Fig 5).
Albendazole	Placebo	Haemagglutination inhibition titers	1821	2037	HI titers against both influenza A strains as well as memory B-cell response were modestly higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant
Albendazole	Placebo	Haemagglutination inhibition titers	1821	2038	HI titers against both influenza A strains as well as memory B-cell response were modestly higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant.
Albendazole	Placebo	Total IgA levels at day 28	23196	23310	Total IgA was elevated in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group at Day 28 (p-value 0.006)
