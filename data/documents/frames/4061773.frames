(ACU) sodium citrate dihydrate (Na-CIT) supplementation (0.5kg-1; acute placebo (PLC-A),), and chronic placebo (PLC-C); chronic sodium citrate dihydrate (Na-CIT) (CHR) supplementation (0.1kg-1 for three days and 0.3kg-1 on the forth day 120;min pre-trial	baseline	blood lactate concentrations	19430	19936	As expected, blood lactate concentrations were significantly increased from post-ingestion to post-trial (P < 0.05), across all trials. The responders had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations in the ACU compared to the PLC-A trial (P < 0.05), but this was not the case when comparing the CHR versus the PLC-C trial. Furthermore, responders had significantly higher post-trial blood lactate concentrations than non-responders in both the ACU (P < 0.05) and the CHR trials (P < 0.05) (Figure  <NEWLINE>2)
