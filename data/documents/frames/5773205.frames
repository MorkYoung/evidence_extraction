High flow	Low flow	a and b model coefficients (power law models)	21555	21807	It was observed that the a and b model coefficients at the High flow range were statistically significantly higher than those in the Medium (p<0.05 for a coefficient, p<0.01 for b coefficient) and Low (p<0.01 for both a and b coefficients) flow ranges.
power law models	linear models	average flow estimation accuracy	19946	20808	It was observed that the power law models were superior over the linear models at estimating the inhalation flow profile using the acoustic envelope. The average flow estimation accuracy (which was calculated as 100-Averageerror) was 90.89±0.9% (± standard error) for power law and 76.63±2.38% for linear models. Therefore, detailed results of the power law models are discussed from this point onwards in the study. Average flow parameter estimation errors were divided according to calibration and test flow ranges. The overall Averageerror for the power law models was 9.4±0.92% for High flow range, 8.65±1.67% for Medium flow range and 9.29±2.44% for Low flow range (± standard error). This gave an average estimation error of 9.11±0.9% across all participants. Fig 3 presents examples of the estimated flow signals for high, medium and low flow inhalations.
