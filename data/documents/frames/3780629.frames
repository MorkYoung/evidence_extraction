cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT)	baseline	primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress	834	1132	Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62–2.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention
CBM-I (cognitive-bias modification (CBM) + Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT)	baseline	primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress	834	1133	Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62–2.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention.
