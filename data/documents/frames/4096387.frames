Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Median visual analogue scale	767	887	At six-month followup, median visual analogue scale score was significantly higher in group I if compared with group II.
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Recurrence rate at 12 months 	888	1147	The success and recurrence rate at 12-month followup were, respectively, 38.3% (28/73) in group I versus 58.5% (41/70) in group II (P = 0.019; Fisher's exact test) and 30.2% (13/43) in group I versus 14.5% (7/48) in group II (P = 0.0047; Fisher's exact test).
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Success rate at 6 months 	9893	10023	At six-month followup the success rate was 58.9% (43/73) in group I and 68.5% (48/70) in group II (P = 0.29; Fisher's exact test),
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Success rate at 6 months 	9893	10117	At six-month followup the success rate was 58.9% (43/73) in group I and 68.5% (48/70) in group II (P = 0.29; Fisher's exact test), whereas recurrence rate was 41.09% (30/73) in group I and 31.4% (22/70) in group II (P = 0.29

Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Mean anal resting pressure	9706	9870	At manometry, mean anal resting pressure in patients with CAF was significantly higher than in the control group (100.01 ± 12.3 versus 66.8 ± 16.8 mm Hg; P < 0.0001
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum	Control	Success rate at 12 months 	1160	1430	The maintenance therapy with PHGG in patients with healed CAF after chemical sphincterotomy by topical application of GTN 0.4% ointment seems associated with a significant reduction of recurrence rate and with a significant increase of success rate at 12-month followup.
