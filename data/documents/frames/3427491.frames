TOMOX	FOLFOX4	Hepatic disorders and asthenia	1211	1278	hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group (p = ns).
TOMOX	FOLFOX4	Response duration	835	1093	No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292), and response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively
TOMOX	FOLFOX4	Progression-free survival	833	1002	. No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292)
TOMOX	FOLFOX4	Survival rate	835	944	No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475);
