400 μg of misoprostol	400 mg of metronidazole tablets (as a placebo)	Baseline cervical dilatation	9520	9662	Baseline cervical dilatation of 4.6 ± 0.96 mm in the study group was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than the control group (3.6 ± 0.82 mm).
400 Î1⁄4g of misoprostol	400 mg of metronidazole tablets (as a placebo)	Pain on cervical dilatation	9823	9927	Pain on cervical dilatation was significantly less in the study group (P < 0.05) [Table 4 and Figure 1].
400 Î1⁄4g of misoprostol	400 mg of metronidazole tablets (as a placebo)	Pain on cervical dilatation	1181	1354	Only 3.61% patients complained of intolerable pain during dilatation in the study group while in control group 48.74% complained of intolerable pain and required anesthesia.

Baseline cervical dilatation of 4.6 ± 0.96 mm in the study group was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than the control group (3.6 ± 0.82 mm).
