patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	preference for using long-acting injectable [LAI] medication	15516	15708	A statistically significant increase in the preference for using LAIs by prescribers with access to credible PDAI (77.7% vs 25.8% control; P<0.001) was observed for these patients (Figure 3A).
patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	differences in treatment choices	15104	15335	A Wald χ2 test revealed no statistically significant differences in treatment choices between the 2 groups (P=0.553 in the vignette where the patient was nonadherent, whereas P=0.071 in the vignette where the patient was adherent).
patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	increase the dose and switch medications	17070	17239	providers with access to credible PDAI were more likely to increase the dose (49.1% vs 39.1% control; P<0.001) and switch medications (24.8% vs 20.9% control; P<<0.001),
patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	preference for using long-acting injectable [LAI] medication	1269	1498	For 3 nonadherent patient vignettes, respondents in the experimental group were more likely to choose a long-acting injectable antipsychotic compared with those in the control group (77.7% experimental vs 25.8% control; P<0.001).
patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	adherent patient who had recently been experiencing paranoid delusions	16080	16337	For an adherent patient who had recently been experiencing paranoid delusions, a Wald χ2 test indicated that overall differences in treatment patterns were not significantly different (P=0.054) between providers who had access to PDAI and those who did not.
patient drug adherence information (PDAI)	control	increase the dose and switch medications	17050	17317	Across the 2 cases, providers with access to credible PDAI were more likely to increase the dose (49.1% vs 39.1% control; P<0.001) and switch medications (24.8% vs 20.9% control; P<<0.001), but were less likely to switch to an LAI (2.8% vs16.4% for control; P=0.061).
