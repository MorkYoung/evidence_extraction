Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Blood chemistry count	1801	2001	There were no statistically significant interaction effects (group × time) for any blood chemistry count measures indicating no specific effects of supplementation on these variables (p values > 0.05)
Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Complete blood count measures	1801	2002	There were no statistically significant interaction effects (group × time) for any blood chemistry count measures indicating no specific effects of supplementation on these variables (p values > 0.05).
Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Diastolic blood pressure 	2689	2799	no significant effects of group or significant group × time interactions for HR, SBP, or DBP (p values < 0.05)
Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Complete blood count measures	3016	3091	Bio-GroTM, produced no significant effects on complete blood count measures
Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Metabolic panel	2335	2581	Analyses also showed no statistically significant interaction effects (group × time) for any comprehensive metabolic panel measures which indicated that Bio-GroTM had not specific effects on the measures of the metabolic panels (p values > 0.05).
Bio-active peptide supplement	Placebo	Diastolic blood pressure 	2583	2885	The analyses of resting hemodynamic measurements revealed significant time effects for HR (p < 0.05) with no significant effects of group or significant group × time interactions for HR, SBP, or DBP (p values < 0.05) again indicating that the supplementation had no specific effects on these variables.
