scaling and root planning (SRP) in combination with amoxicillin plus metronidazole	scaling and root planning (SRP) alone (control)	clinical healing	1864	2001	metronidazole and amoxicillin combination as an adjunct to SRP results in better clinical healing through restoring TIMP-1/MMP-1 balance.
scaling and root planning (SRP) in combination with amoxicillin plus metronidazole	scaling and root planning (SRP) alone (control)	Total MMP-1 levels at 3 months	1313	1405	Total MMP-1 levels were significantly decreased in both groups (P < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months.
scaling and root planning (SRP) in combination with amoxicillin plus metronidazole	scaling and root planning (SRP) alone (control)	TIMP-1/MMP-1 balance	1686	1800	TIMP-1/MMP-1 balance was restored in test group at 6 months significantly better than the control group (P < 0.05)
scaling and root planning (SRP) in combination with amoxicillin plus metronidazole	scaling and root planning (SRP) alone (control)	periodontal disease (PD) 	15978	16189	Both treatment modalities were successful on PD measurements and CAL over 3 and 6 months compared to the baseline (P < 0.05; respectively). No significant differences were observed between the groups (P > 0.05).
scaling and root planning (SRP) in combination with amoxicillin plus metronidazole	scaling and root planning (SRP) alone (control)	Total MMP-1 levels at 3 months	17439	17668	. Total MMP-1 levels were significantly decreased in both groups (P < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months. When we evaluated the MMP-1 concentration levels, a similar pattern was observed; the decrease at 3 months was significant (P < 0.05).
