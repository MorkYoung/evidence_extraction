2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	HR	20259	20302	HR was not different between the treatments
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	Hunger, Prospective eating, desire to eat (Pre, immediately before, after, and 30 min post exercise).	20652	20905	There were significant treatment effects (YM vs. PLC) on VAS measures of Hunger (p = 0.019), Prospective eating (p = 0.022), and a trend towards a reduced desire to eat (p = 0.079) for exercise (Pre, immediately before, after, and 30 min post exercise).
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	prospective eating score	21085	21274	When analyzing the resting data only (immediately pre-ingestion 0 to 120 min rest duration), only prospective eating score was slightly reduced (p = 0.046) at YM treatment compared with PLC
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	fatty acid oxidation (FAO)	1170	1311	Combining YM intake with prolonged exercise at targeted "fat-loss"' intensities augments FAO and improves measures of satiety and mood state.
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	total AUC for Total Energy Expenditure (TEE)	20171	20257	However, the total AUC for TEE was higher (85.60 vs. 82.13, p < 0.001) in YM than PLC.
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	fatty acid oxidation (FAO)	19050	19208	The YM treatment elicited significantly higher FAO compared with PLC during the 30-min steady-state exercise (ANOVA treatment effects, p = 0.037), (Figure 1).
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	Hunger, Prospective eating, desire to eat (Pre, immediately before, after, and 30 min post exercise).	849	938	VAS scores for hunger, prospective eating, and desire to eat were all reduced (p < 0.05).
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	HR	20259	20365	HR was not different between the treatments, but the time had significant effects (p < 0.001), (Figure 4).
2 g of YM	placebo (PLC)	prospective eating score	849	938	VAS scores for hunger, prospective eating, and desire to eat were all reduced (p < 0.05).
