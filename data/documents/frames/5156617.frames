myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D	baseline	The Efron grading scale scores	15788	15907	The Efron grading scale scores during the trial were normal for all eyes in all categories except for "corneal staining
myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D	baseline	The Efron grading scale scores	15908	16254	" in which 38 eyes (97.44%) were normal, and one eye (2.56%) was graded as trace before wearing the lenses. After 4 weeks of lens use, 25 eyes (80.65%) were normal, four eyes (12.90%) were graded as trace, and two eyes (6.45%) were graded as mild. The difference in grading before and after lens use was not statistically significant (p = 0.815).
myopia of -0.75 to -6.0 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D	baseline	The Efron grading scale scores	16016	16254	After 4 weeks of lens use, 25 eyes (80.65%) were normal, four eyes (12.90%) were graded as trace, and two eyes (6.45%) were graded as mild. The difference in grading before and after lens use was not statistically significant (p = 0.815).
astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D	baseline	The mean astigmatic refractive error	814	1233	A total of 19 subjects (31 eyes) completed the trial after five subjects (eight eyes) dropped out. In the patients who completed the study by wearing lenses for 4 weeks, the myopic refractive error decreased significantly by 2.60 ± 2.21 D (p < 0.001), from -3.65 ± 1.62 to -1.05 ± 1.64 D. The astigmatic refractive error were also significantly decreased by 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001), from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D.
astigmatism of 1.25 to 4.0 D	baseline	The mean astigmatic refractive error	13077	13278	The mean astigmatic refractive error changed from 2.07 ± 0.83 to 1.44 ± 0.99 D after wearing the lenses for 4 weeks, which constituted a statistically significant decrease of 0.63 ± 0.98 D (p = 0.001).
