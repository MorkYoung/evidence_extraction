Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Tip and tripod pinch strength	-1	-1	The post-intervention between-group mean differences for strength were 0.5 (95%CI 0.2–0.9) for tip pinch, and 0.3 (95%CI 0.1–0.6) for the tripod pinch. Between-group effect sizes were small to moderate (d=0.35) for tip pinch and small to moderate (d=0.39) for tripod pinch strength (Table 2).
Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Pressure pain thresholds at the thumb CMC joint, scaphoid bone and hamate bone	986	1291	Significant increases in PPT in the experimental group at all <NEWLINE>follow-up periods as compared with baseline data were found. The post-intervention <NEWLINE>between-group mean differences for PPT were 1.1 (95%CI 0.4–1.8) for the CMC joint, 1.1 <NEWLINE>(95%CI 0.2–2.1) for the scaphoid, and 1.5 (95%CI 0.5–2.8) for the hamate.

Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Tip and tripod pinch strength	1292	1432	The <NEWLINE>post-intervention between-group mean differences were 0.5 (95%CI 0.2–0.9) for the tip <NEWLINE>pinch and 0.3 (95%CI 0.1–0.6) for the tripod pinch
Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Tip and tripod pinch strength	-1	-1	We also found that a unilateral Kaltenborn mobilization exerted motor effects on the contralateral hand by increasing the tip and tripod pinch strength in women with thumb CMC OA. In fact, the tip and tripod pinch strength increased 22% and 26% respectively, supporting a motor effect after the intervention. However, some of these changes were small, and their clinical relevance should be considered with caution particularly considering that they refer to the non-symptomatic side.
Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Baseline characteristics, except for scaphoid bone	11366	11488	No significant statistical differences were found in any outcome <NEWLINE>at baseline between groups, except for the scaphoid bone.
Kaltenborn mobilization therapy	Placebo therapy	Tip and tripod pinch strength	-1	-1	Motor changes were also observed, as shown by increased tip and tripod pinch strength, in the contralateral hand. However, some of these changes were small, and their clinical relevance should be considered with caution particularly considering that they refer to the non-symptomatic side.
