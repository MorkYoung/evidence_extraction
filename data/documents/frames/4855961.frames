60.000 IU monthly	30.000 IU monthly	Pregnancy outcomes	14343	14456	however the difference in pregnancy outcomes between various study groups did not reach statistical significance.
60.000 IU monthly	Control	25-hydroxyvitamin D	12959	13200	Vitamin D level significantly increased in all four groups with mean increment of 12.7 ± 23.9 ng/ml with 1000 IU/day, 17.1 ± 21.0 ng/ml with 2000 IU/day, 16.0 ± 14.6 ng/ml with 30,000 IU monthly, and 23.8 ± 18.1 ng/ml with 60,000 IU monthly.
60.000 IU monthly	Control	25-hydroxyvitamin D	1635	1795	We concluded that Vitamin D supplementation with 2000 IU/day or 60,000 IU/month is very effective and safe in achieving Vitamin D sufficiency in pregnant women.
60.000 IU monthly	30.000 IU monthly	Pregnancy outcomes	14221	14456	With respect to the safety of Vitamin D supplementation, overall there were few adverse outcomes in the study population; however the difference in pregnancy outcomes between various study groups did not reach statistical significance.
30.000 IU monthly	Control	25-hydroxyvitamin D	13944	14220	ne of the primary objectives of the study was to find the difference in the postsupplementation levels of 25(OH)D between Group 1K and 2K regimen. As shown in Table 3, there was a significant difference (P = 0.023) between these two groups with Group 2K showing higher levels.
60.000 IU monthly	Control	25-hydroxyvitamin D	1474	1611	The postsupplementation levels of 25(OH)D were higher in Group 2K (42.86 ± 12.83) than in Group 1K (36.96 ± 10.56) with P value of 0.023.
30.000 IU monthly	Control	25-hydroxyvitamin D	12959	13200	Vitamin D level significantly increased in all four groups with mean increment of 12.7 ± 23.9 ng/ml with 1000 IU/day, 17.1 ± 21.0 ng/ml with 2000 IU/day, 16.0 ± 14.6 ng/ml with 30,000 IU monthly, and 23.8 ± 18.1 ng/ml with 60,000 IU monthly.
