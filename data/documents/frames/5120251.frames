Tranexamic Acid	Control	Hemoglobin decrease 	1830	1958	TRA significantly reduces bleeding after prostatectomy surgery and is effective in preventing postoperative hemoglobin decrease.
Tranexamic Acid	Control	Decrease of platelets	1629	1752	The decrease in platelet level in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.03).
Tranexamic Acid	Control	Hemoglobin decrease 	10198	10415	The decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after surgery were lesser in the intervention group than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04, respectively, and P = 0.05).
Tranexamic Acid	Control	Decrease of platelets	1630	1752	he decrease in platelet level in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.03).
Tranexamic Acid	Control	Blood loss	1493	1628	Blood loss in the intervention group with the administration of TRA was significantly lesser than that in the control group (P = 0.01).
Tranexamic Acid	Control	Hematocrit decrease 	10198	10415	The decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after surgery were lesser in the intervention group than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04, respectively, and P = 0.05).
