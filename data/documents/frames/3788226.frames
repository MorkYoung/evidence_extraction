Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Appropriate laryngoscopic view	1402	1536	Truview blade produced a better laryngoscopic view (P = 0.005) than Macintosh blade, but had a longer time to laryngoscopy (P = 0.04).
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Laryngoscopy time	1402	1536	Truview blade produced a better laryngoscopic view (P = 0.005) than Macintosh blade, but had a longer time to laryngoscopy (P = 0.04).
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Cervical spine movement at C1-C2	1107	1255	the movement was significantly less with Truview compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope at C0–C1 (21%; P = 0.005) and C1–C2 levels (32%; P = 0.009).
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Atlantooccipital distance	1256	1401	The atlantooccipital distance (AOD) traversed while using Truview laryngoscope was significantly less than with Macintosh blade (26%; P = 0.001).
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Cervical spine movement at C1-C2	944	1255	Significant cervical spine movement occurred at all segments when compared to the baseline with both the Macintosh and Truview laryngoscopes (P < 0.001). However, the movement was significantly less with Truview compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope at C0–C1 (21%; P = 0.005) and C1–C2 levels (32%; P = 0.009).
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Cervical spine movement at C0-C1	1107	1220	the movement was significantly less with Truview compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope at C0–C1 (21%; P = 0.005)
Truview laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Cervical spine movement at C0-C1	-1	-1	Mean segmental cervical spine movement with Truview versus Macintosh laryngoscope. *P< 0.001, †P=0.005 (C0–C1), 0.009 (C1–C2), and 0.001 (atlantooccipital distance (AOD))
