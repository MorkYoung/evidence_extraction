Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Plan preference, planner, or planning institution	1997	2110	. No statistically significant association was found between plan preference and planning institution or planner.
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Hot spot located inside or outside the target	16344	16951	The nEUD for clinical target volumes (CTV) and the location of the hot spot relative to the target volume are presented in Table 3. The mean nEUD for Perspecta and Pinnacle plans differed by less than 2% and the median was nearly the same, indicating similar target dose delivered by rival plans. The Table also shows that Perspecta plans were more likely to have the hot spot located inside the target (43% vs. 33%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.61). Conversely, 30% of the Pinnacle plans had the hot spot outside the target compared with 18% for Perspecta plans (p=0.34).
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Dose delivered to normal tissues	17466	17682	A total of 161 normal structures were contoured for patients in the study. Of those structures, 92 showed lower doses with the Perspecta plan (57%). The difference, however, was not statistically significant (p=0.07)
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Use of non�coplanar beams	15732	15805	The use of non‐coplanar beams was more frequent with Perspecta (p<0.001).

Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Plan preference, planner, or planning institution	14691	14820	No statistically significant association was found between plan preference and planning institution (p=0.43) or planner (p=0.44).
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Use of non�coplanar beams	1565	1713	The use of non‐coplanar beams was more common with Perspecta plans (82% vs. 27%). The mean target dose differed by less than 2% between rival plans.
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Number of iterations	15864	15954	the number of iterations did not significantly differ between the two planning techniques.
Pinnacle plan	Perspecta plans	Hot spot located inside or outside the target	16667	16951	Perspecta plans were more likely to have the hot spot located inside the target (43% vs. 33%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.61). Conversely, 30% of the Pinnacle plans had the hot spot outside the target compared with 18% for Perspecta plans (p=0.34).
