problem based learning intervention or critical reading intervention	no intervention (control group, which continued clinical practice as normal)	cognitive, habitual behavioral, affective	26500	27025	In all three dimensions there were significant differences within the groups in the pre- versus post-intervention scores, yet no significant differences were observed between groups. No interaction between pre- and post-intervention differences was detected in any of the groups for any dimension (Table 4). A post-hoc power analysis revealed that the sample size was insufficient to detect statistical differences in each of the groups for the effect size given by the mean scores between each group after the interventions.
