insulin aspart 0.1 units/kg	insulin aspart 0.2 units/kg	90 min after the meal (PP), plasma insulin	8607	8800	Maximal levels of insulin were achieved 30–60 min after the meal (Fig. 1); 90 min after the meal (PP), plasma insulin was higher after 0.2 compared with 0.1 units/kg insulin aspart (P = 0.004).
insulin aspart 0.1 units/kg or 0.2 units/kg	placebo	U46619-induced fibrinogen binding	1166	1306	U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by ∼50–60%) after premeal insulin.
insulin aspart 0.1 units/kg or 0.2 units/kg	placebo	enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression	1009	1164	he standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin
