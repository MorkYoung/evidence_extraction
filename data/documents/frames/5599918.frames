Fentanyl-based IV-PCA only (IV-PCA group)	Conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Total dose of ephedrine	15253	15401	the patients in the E-PCA group required more ephedrine than those in the IV-PCA group (8.4 ± 9.1 vs. 4.0 ± 4.8 μg; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.013).
Fentanyl-based IV-PCA only (IV-PCA group)	Dexmedetomidine plus fentanyl-based IV-PCA (dIV-PCA group) and Conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Total dose of remifentanil	15066	15239	The total administered dose of remifentanil was higher in the IV-PCA group than in the E-PCA and dIV-PCA groups (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.017 and P < 0.001, respectively).
Fentanyl-based IV-PCA only (IV-PCA group)	Conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Total dose of ephedrine	15240	15401	In addition, the patients in the E-PCA group required more ephedrine than those in the IV-PCA group (8.4 ± 9.1 vs. 4.0 ± 4.8 μg; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.013).
Dexmedetomidine plus fentanyl-based IV-PCA (dIV-PCA group) and Conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Fentanyl-based IV-PCA only (IV-PCA group)	Need for additional analgesic rescues, number of bolus attempts, and bolus deliveries	1505	1787	Patients in the dIV-PCA and E-PCA groups needed significantly fewer additional analgesic rescues between 6 and 24 hours after surgery, and had a significantly lower number of bolus attempts and bolus deliveries during the first 24 hours after surgery than those in the IV-PCA group.
Dexmedetomidine plus fentanyl-based IV-PCA (dIV-PCA group)	Conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Pain intensity after surgery	1328	1504	The postoperative pain intensity was significantly lower in the dIV-PCA and E-PCA groups than in the IV-PCA group, but comparable between the dIV-PCA group and the E-PCA group.
Dexmedetomidine plus fentanyl-based IV-PCA (dIV-PCA group) and conventional thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (E-PCA group)	Fentanyl-based IV-PCA only (IV-PCA group)	Pain intensity after surgery	1328	1441	The postoperative pain intensity was significantly lower in the dIV-PCA and E-PCA groups than in the IV-PCA group
