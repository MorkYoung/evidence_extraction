Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Rescue analgesics frequency 	1026	1106	However, the frequency of rescue analgesics did not differ between these groups.
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Analgesics side effects	12868	12943	The rates of side effects of analgesics were also similar in the two groups
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Opioid requirement	905	1025	Opioid requirement was lower in the PECS II than in the control group (43.8 ± 28.5 μg versus 77.0 ± 41.9 μg, p < 0.001).
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Rescue analgesics frequency 	1026	1105	However, the frequency of rescue analgesics did not differ between these groups
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Complications	13887	13967	None of these patients reported complications associated with the PECS II block.
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Opioid requirement	12615	12945	Opioid consumption during the first 24 hours after surgery was significantly lower in the PECS II group than in the control group (43.8 ± 28.5 μg versus 77.0 ± 41.9 μg, p < 0.001), but the frequency of rescue NSAIDs did not differ between these groups. The rates of side effects of analgesics were also similar in the two groups (
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Mean NRS value	13380	13593	Mean NRS value of the breast was significantly lower in the PECS II than in the control group at 0 (3.0 ± 1.5 versus 4.9 ± 1.6, p < 0.001) and 0.5 (3.6 ± 1.5 versus 5.1 ± 1.8, p < 0.001) hours after the procedure.
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Axilary numeric rating scale	13725	13885	Median NRS value of the axilla, however, was significantly lower in the PECS II than in the control group throughout the first 24 hours after surgery (Figure 4)
Pectoral nerve block type II 	Control	Axilary numeric rating scale	1314	1389	The axillary NRS was consistently lower through 24 hr in the PECS II group.
