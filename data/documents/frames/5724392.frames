phlebotomy (Alternative Arm) 	chelation (Standard Arm)	Iron burden	1775	1959	Iron burden decreased more in the Alternative Arm, with ferritin difference −1047 ng/mL (−1524, −570), p<0.001 and liver iron difference −4.3 mg Fe/gm dry weight (−6.1, −2.5), p=0.001.
hydroxyurea	transfusions	transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocities	18279	18843	The final model-based TCD velocities (mean ± standard error) on the Standard Arm versus Alternative Arm were 143 ± 1.6 and 138 ± 1.6 cm/sec, respectively, with difference (95% CI) = 4.54 (0.10, 8.98), non-inferiority p=8.82 × 10−16 and a post-hoc superiority p=0.023. The planned per-protocol analysis excluding study participants who exited the study early showed almost identical findings, with difference = 5.06 (0.56, 9.57), non-inferiority p=1.05 × 10−15 and a post-hoc superiority p=0.015. An age-adjusted analysis gave almost identical findings (not shown).
