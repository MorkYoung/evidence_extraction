Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Postoperative pain	770	864	There was no significant difference in postoperative pain between the study groups (P = 0.22).
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Time needed for debridement	1203	1315	Alcohol-assisted debridement required less time than mechanical debridement (96±18 vs. 118±26 seconds, P=0.035).
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Mean spherical equivalent	654	768	. Mean spherical equivalent was −4.37±2.3 D in the alcohol group and −3.8±1.3 D in the mechanical group (P = 0.78)
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Uncorrected visual acuity ≥ 20/20 and ≥ 20/40	865	1051	Uncorrected visual acuity ≥ 20/20 and ≥ 20/40 was achieved in 90.9% versus 93.4% (P = 0.08), and 98.9% versus 99.5% (P = 0.36) of eyes in the alcohol and mechanical groups, respectively.
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Final refractive error within 1D of emmetropia	1052	1202	Final refractive error within 1D of emmetropia was achieved in 90% versus 92.2% of eyes in the alcohol and mechanical groups, respectively (P = 0.23).
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Postoperative pain	11072	11169	Mean pain score was 4.7±1.2 in the alcohol group versus 5.3±1.5 in the mechanical group (P=0.22).
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Time needed for debridement	10636	10772	Mean time for alcohol-assisted epithelial removal was 96±18 seconds and that for simple mechanical removal was 118±26 seconds (P=0.035).
Alcohol-assisted epithelial removal	Mechanical epithelial removal	Mean spherical equivalent	656	769	Mean spherical equivalent was −4.37±2.3 D in the alcohol group and −3.8±1.3 D in the mechanical group (P = 0.78).
