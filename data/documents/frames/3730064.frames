2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1)	baseline	the preoperative corneal neovascularization (NV) area	10768	11048	In group 1, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 ± 4.33%, mean ± standard deviation) decreased significantly to 5.62 ± 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 ± 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, p = 0.012, respectively; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Fig. 2A).
2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1)	1 mg of ranibizumab (group 2)	uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)	10175	10442	There was no difference in UCVA or BCVA between groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.721, p = 0.878; Mann-Whitney U-test). The mean change of visual acuity did not show an improvement in either group after the injections (p > 0.05 in all tests; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Table 2).
