Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Quality-of-life improvement after 6 months	1518	1748	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively), and so did general health perception differences at 6 months (P = .018).
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Quality-of-life improvement after 6 months	1518	1675	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively),
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Use of painkillers	19366	19509	No differences were found in the use of painkillers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or dose or frequency between groups at any time point.
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Quality-of-life improvement after 3 months	1518	1748	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively), and so did general health perception differences at 6 months (P = .018).
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Patient satisfaction	19510	19675	At 6 months, patient satisfaction tended to be higher in the study group; however, we were unable to find statistically significant differences (P = .472) (Table 3).
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Adverse effects	19308	19365	No patient had adverse effects at injection or follow-up.
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Quality-of-life improvement after 3 months	1518	1674	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively)
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma 	Control	Patient satisfaction	19510	19664	At 6 months, patient satisfaction tended to be higher in the study group; however, we were unable to find statistically significant differences (P = .472)
Leukocyte-reduced Platelet-Rich Plasma	Control	General health perception improvement after 6 months	1518	1748	Quality-of-life differences between values at 3 and 6 months versus baseline increased significantly more in the study group (P = .05 and .03, respectively), and so did general health perception differences at 6 months (P = .018).
