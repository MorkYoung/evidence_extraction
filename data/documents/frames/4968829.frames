younger subjects	older subjects	improved VO2max (l/min) from cycling to rowing	12901	13352	Both older and younger subjects had higher VO2max (l/min) values with rowing than cycling, however, the effect of mode of exercise, difference in VO2max (l/min) between cycling and rowing was significantly less in older subjects relative to the difference noted in younger subjects (p<0.05). Older subjects increased VO2max (l/min) by 10% from cycling to rowing (Fig 1A, p<0.05), while younger rowers improved VO2max (l/min) by 16.7% (Fig 1A, p<0.05).
