detemir	glargine, NPH insuline	endogenous glucose production (EGP)	5519	5835	residual EGP was greater in people with BMI >29 vs. <29 kg/m2, although significance was achieved with detemir (7.8 ± 1.8 vs. 4.1 ± 2.1 μmol/kg/min, P = 0.001) but not with glargine (5.3 ± 1.3 vs. 3.8 ± 2.7 μmol/kg/min, P = 0.231) and tended to be different with NPH (6.6 ± 2.2 vs. 4.0 ± 2.1 μmol/kg/min, P = 0.068).
detemir	glargine, NPH insuline	glucose infusion rate (GIR)	4448	4694	Bivariate correlations of BMI and GIR split by treatment showed an inverse correlation that was significant only with detemir (r = −0.68, P = 0.003), but not with glargine (r = −0.41, P = 0.11) and NPH (r = −0.37, P = 0.15) (Supplementary Fig. 1)
detemir	glargine, NPH insuline	glucose infusion rate (GIR)	5108	5505	On the basis of BMI status, with all three basal insulins, GIR was lower in people with BMI >29 kg/m2 compared with people with BMI <29 kg/m2 (Fig. 1), but statistical significance was achieved with detemir treatment only (598 ± 604 and 1,564 ± 649 mg/kg, respectively; P = 0.03) and not with NPH (1,058 ± 859 and 1,282 ± 532 mg/kg) and glargine (1,408 ± 563 and 1,668 ± 807 mg/kg) (both P > 0.2).
