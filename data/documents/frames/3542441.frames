AGE + exercise	HFD	body weight gain and food efficiency ratio	948	1057	Exercise, and Exercise+AGE (P < 0.001) attenuated body weight gain and food efficiency ratio compared to HFD.
AGE	HFD	Visceral fat and liver weight gain	1058	1510	Visceral fat and liver weight gain were attenuated (P < 0.05) with all three interventions with a greater effect on visceral fat in the Exercise+AGE than AGE (P < 0.001). In reducing visceral fat (P < 0.001), epididymal fat (P < 0.01) and liver weight (P < 0.001), Exercise+AGE was effective, but exercise showed a stronger suppressive effect than AGE. Exercise+AGE showed further additive effects on reducing visceral fat and liver weight (P < 0.001).
AGE + exercise	HFD	Visceral fat and liver weight gain	11383	11502	Visceral fat, epididymal fat, and liver weights were significantly higher in the HFD group compared to the other groups
exercise	HFD	body weight gain and food efficiency ratio	932	1056	AGE (P < 0.01), Exercise, and Exercise+AGE (P < 0.001) attenuated body weight gain and food efficiency ratio compared to HFD
AGE	HFD	body weight gain and food efficiency ratio	948	1057	Exercise, and Exercise+AGE (P < 0.001) attenuated body weight gain and food efficiency ratio compared to HFD.
