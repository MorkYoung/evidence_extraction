Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Inhibition of food cravings	836	942	With an improved sham control condition, prefrontal rTMS inhibited food cravings no better than sham rTMS.
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Inhibition of food cravings	12396	12537	Change in cravings was slightly larger in the sham-TMS group, but the effect size (Cohen's d) was very small (d = 0.09) in favor of sham-TMS.
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Face and scalp sensations	11309	11582	At the end of the study, participants were asked to guess which rTMS session was real and which was sham. Only 40% of participants guessed correctly (p = 0.27), suggesting that the sham condition was reasonably matched to real TMS with respect to face and scalp sensations.
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Hours elapsed since the participant's last meal	11937	12258	There was no significant difference in hours since last ate between sham and real TMS conditions [t(9) = 0.52, ns], but when we controlled for hours since participants last ate, no effects were observed for time [F(1,8) = 2.97, ns], condition [F(1,8) = 1.94, ns], or the time by condition interaction [F(1,8) = 2.07, ns].
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Hours elapsed since the participant's last meal	-1	-1	There was a significant drop in cravings in both the real- and sham-TMS conditions, with no difference between conditions before or after controlling for hours since last meal.
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Face and scalp sensations	11415	11582	Only 40% of participants guessed correctly (p = 0.27), suggesting that the sham condition was reasonably matched to real TMS with respect to face and scalp sensations.
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Inhibition of food cravings	11648	11808	Analysis of variance results revealed that cravings were significantly lower following rTMS regardless of whether it was real or sham [F(1,9) = 15.91, p = 0.003
Prefrontal rTMS	Sham rTMS	Hours elapsed since the participant's last meal	11937	12051	There was no significant difference in hours since last ate between sham and real TMS conditions [t(9) = 0.52, ns]
