fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO group)	control	recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in the first year	835	1107	146 infants attended the 12-month follow-up visit. Infants born to mothers from the FeNO group were significantly less likely to have recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in the first year of life (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; p=0.016) as compared with the clinical group.
