pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	Decrease in 10-point numerical rating scale (NRS) at the first follow-up evaluation - Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)	14522	14830	. In the PRF group, NRS decreased from 6.46 at baseline to 2.76, 4.30, and 5.13 at the 1 week, 1 month, and 3 month follow-up visits, respectively (P < 0.0001). In the TENS group, NRS decreased from 6.10 to 3.96, 5.23, and 5.90 at the 1 week, 1 month, and 3 month follow-up visits, respectively (P < 0.0001).
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	baseline detected temperature - Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)	14322	14402	An increase over baseline detected temperature was observed in all PRF subjects.
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	promising pain relief treatments for painful DNP	2056	2217	Both TENS and PRF lumbar sympathectomy are promising pain relief treatments for painful DNP. However, PRF lumbar sympathectomy seems to have a superior efficacy.
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	superior efficacy	19268	19434	In conclusion, both PRF sympathectomy and TENS can reduce lower extremity pain in patients with PDPN. However, PRF sympathectomy seems to be more effective than TENS.
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	superior efficacy	2158	2216	PRF lumbar sympathectomy seems to have a superior efficacy
pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) lumbar sympathectomy 	transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	Decrease in 10-point numerical rating scale (NRS) at the first follow-up evaluation - Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)	1333	1477	In both groups, the NRS rating significantly decreased after treatment, with a marked pain reduction observed at the first follow-up evaluation.
