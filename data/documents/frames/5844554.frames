secure conditions	neutral priming conditions	attachment anxiety positively predicted performance in n-back tasks in non-attachment related words	34634	34982	In secure priming condition, this negative association between attachment anxiety and n-back task performance became reversed (see Fig 4). Specifically, after secure priming, attachment anxiety positively predicted performance in n-back tasks including both attachment related (β = .28, p < .05) and non-attachment related words (β = .37, p < .05).

In other words, the subliminal priming of the security led to increased WM capacity of individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety.
