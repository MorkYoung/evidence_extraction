10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	maternal mean arterial blood pressure or maternal heart rate	19064	19254	No significant difference was observed in the estimated slope differences of maternal mean arterial blood pressure (0.25, p=0.188; Figure 3) or maternal heart rate (0.03, p=0.807; Figure 4).
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	analgesic spread (spinal level/minute)	18178	18404	The estimated difference in analgesic spread (spinal level/minute), as defined by loss of sharpness of pinprick, was 0.63 (95% CI: −0.12 to 0.19) and did not significantly differ between groups (p=0.166; Figure 2 and Table 2).
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	adverse events	2073	2292	This investigation observed that epidural needle and catheter injection of medications result in similar onset of analgesia and sensory blockade, quality of labor analgesia, patient satisfaction, and complication rates.
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	adverse events	19383	19432	No adverse events occurred in either study group.
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	rate of pain relief (VRS/minute)	1626	1732	he estimated difference in the rate of pain relief (VRS/minute) was 0.04 (95% CI: −0.01 to 0.11; p=0.109),
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	rate of pain relief (VRS/minute)	17721	18004	The estimated difference in rate of pain relief (slope) from the time of medication dosing, reported as VRS pain score/minute, between the epidural needle and epidural catheter groups was 0.04 (95% CI: −0.01 to 0.11) and not statistically significant (p=0.109; Figure 1 and Table 2).
10 mL loading dose (0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 μg/mL) through either the epidural needle	catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart	The time to VRS ≤3 and level of sensory block 20 minutes after dosing	1857	1960	The time to VRS ≤3 and level of sensory block 20 minutes after dosing were also similar between groups.
