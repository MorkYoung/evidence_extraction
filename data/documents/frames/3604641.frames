100, 150 mg of MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator), 45 mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-γ agonist)	baseline	plasma glucose levels	5551	5871	There was a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels in the MSDC-0160 100-mg group (least-squares mean difference of −18.4 mg/dl; P = 0.0057), the MSDC-0160 150-mg group (least-squares mean difference of −28.9 mg/dl; P < 0.0001), and the pioglitazone group (least-squares mean difference of −31 mg/dl; P < 0.0001).
MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator)	45 mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-γ agonist)	high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin	949	1077	There was also a smaller increase in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone (P < 0.0001),
50, 100, 150 mg MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator)	45 mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-γ agonist)	hematocrit, red blood cells, and total hemoglobin	795	948	By contrast, fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit, red blood cells, and total hemoglobin was 50% less in the MSDC-0160–treated groups.
100, 150 mg MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator)	45 mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-γ agonist)	The decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)	642	794	The decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone.
