Active Control	baseline	story recall at post-intervention	31115	31424	The AE condition experienced significant improvement in story recall at post-intervention (0.44, p < 0.001; BS 95% CI: 0.31/0.59) and a trend for the same at follow-up (0.20, p = 0.05, BS 95% CI: 0.04/0.37) whereas the Active Control group showed no significant change in performance over the study (Table 3).
Active experiencing (AE)	control	thematic recall	27276	27355	as did thematic recall (mean = 0.18, p = 0.03, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.04/0.32)
Active experiencing (AE)	baseline	story recall at post-intervention	27174	27273	Story recall improved at post-intervention (mean = 0.32, p < 0.001, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.21/0.42
Active experiencing (AE)	control	category fluency at follow-up	27614	27864	Task switching also showed nominal gains at post-intervention (mean = 0.14, p = 0.04, α' = 0.01) and follow-up (mean = 0.16, p = 0.04, α' = 0.01), whereas category fluency only improved at follow-up (0.21, p = 0.005, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.09/0.36).
Active experiencing (AE)	control	category fluency at follow-up	27761	27864	whereas category fluency only improved at follow-up (0.21, p = 0.005, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.09/0.36).
Active experiencing (AE)	control	gains in episodic memory	30778	31114	The AE intervention produced greater gains in episodic memory than Active Control. Grouped models of episodic memory had excellent fit (story and thematic recall, respectively): χ(62)2 = 78.51 and 65.78, p = 0.08 and 0.35 (AE = 39.49 and 43.23; Active Control = 39.02 and 22.55); CFI = 0.97 and 0.99; RMSEA = 0.06 and 0.03; SRMR = 0.06.
Active experiencing (AE)	baseline	story recall at post-intervention	31115	31244	The AE condition experienced significant improvement in story recall at post-intervention (0.44, p < 0.001; BS 95% CI: 0.31/0.59)
Active experiencing (AE)	control	Story recall improved at post-intervention	27174	27274	Story recall improved at post-intervention (mean = 0.32, p < 0.001, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.21/0.42)
Active experiencing (AE)	control	thematic recall	27174	27429	Story recall improved at post-intervention (mean = 0.32, p < 0.001, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.21/0.42), as did thematic recall (mean = 0.18, p = 0.03, α' = 0.01; BS 95% CI: 0.04/0.32), although the effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.
