macitentan dose of 600 mg	placebo	Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations	-1	-1	Plasma endothelin-1 concentrations dose-dependently increased following administration of macitentan (Fig. 3) and this effect was statistically significant for doses of 25 mg and higher. The maximum effect was observed with the dose of 600 mg, which increased endothelin-1 concentrations 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.4, 3.4) compared with placebo.

macitentan doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 mg	placebo	adverse event profile	13499	13626	Up to and including a dose of 300 mg, the adverse event profile of macitentan did not significantly differ from that of placebo
macitentan doses of 0.2, 1, 5, 25, 100, 300 and 600 mg	placebo	unexpected adverse events	13367	13497	No unexpected adverse events, signs of oedema and/or serious adverse events were reported and all events resolved without sequelae
