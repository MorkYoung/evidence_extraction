ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	adverse events	19073	19292	Although differences between products were seen for individual adverse events, evaluation over the entire study showed no notable differences in TRAE incidence by manufacturer, either overall or attributable to ch14.18.
ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	Cmax	1731	1935	Products' systemic exposures were comparable, with 90 % CIs around ratios for AUCinf (0.96; 90 % CI 0.88–1.04) and Cmax (1.04; 90 % CI 0.98–1.11) within standard bioequivalence bounds (90 % CI 0.80–1.25).
ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	Cmax	18138	18263	Population pharmacokinetic estimates for Cmax were 6.57 μg/mL and 6.88 μg/mL, respectively (ratio = 0.96; 90 % CI 0.88–1.04).
ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	AUCinf	1731	1935	Products' systemic exposures were comparable, with 90 % CIs around ratios for AUCinf (0.96; 90 % CI 0.88–1.04) and Cmax (1.04; 90 % CI 0.98–1.11) within standard bioequivalence bounds (90 % CI 0.80–1.25).
ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	AUCinf	17945	18137	Following standardized single-dose regimens, population pharmacokinetic estimates for AUCinf were 431 μg·h/mL for ch14.18-UTC and 413 μg·h/mL for ch14.18-NCI (ratio = 1.04; 90 % CI 0.98–1.11).
ch14.18-UTC	ch14.18-NCI	adverse events	1936	2020	Products' adverse events were similar and consistent with those previously reported.
