moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil tolerance - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	22366	22523	Remifentanil was well tolerated and the adverse event profile was consistent with what would be expected in ICU patients receiving a potent Î¼ opioid agonist.
moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil tolerance - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	32526	32632	Remifentanil was generally well tolerated in both groups, which were separated by differing renal function
Remifentanil	hypnotic based sedative techniques	Propofol consumption - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	1419	1532	Propofol consumption was lower with the remifentanil based technique than with hypnotic based sedative techniques
moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil incidence of adverse events - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	32634	32845	Although the incidence of adverse events was higher in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment than in the normal/mild group (37% versus 10%), this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.451)
moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil tolerance - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	1731	1762	Remifentanil was well tolerated
moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil incidence of adverse events - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	1534	1655	There were no statistically significant differences between the renal function groups in the incidence of adverse events,
moderate/severe renal impairment 	normal/mild group	Remifentanil tolerance - ICU patients with various degrees of renal impairment	1534	1708	There were no statistically significant differences between the renal function groups in the incidence of adverse events, and no deaths were attributable to remifentanil use.
