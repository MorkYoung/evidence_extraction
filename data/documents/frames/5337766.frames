group D Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone/ Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH/rFSH)	groups B ( hFSH) and C(rFSH)	The serum estradiol level	1239	1334	The serum estradiol level was significantly higher in group D than in groups B and C (P=0.005).
group D Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone/ Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH/rFSH)	groups A human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), B Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (hFSH), and C Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH)	The number of ampoules of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSG)	1027	1140	Group D patients required significantly fewer ampoules of FSH than did the women in groups A, B, and C (P=0.004).
group D Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone/ Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH/rFSH)	groups A human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), B Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (hFSH), and C Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH)	The number of ampoules of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSG)	13835	14020	The number of ampoules or vials of gonadotropin administered was lower in group D than in the other groups; this difference was statistically significant compared to groups A, B, and C.
group C Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (hFSH)	groups A (hMG) and D (hFSH/rFSH)	The duration of stimulation	1141	1238	The duration of stimulation was significantly longer in group C than in groups A and D (P=0.030).
