70 mg SC enoxaparin for a period of 24 hours	40, 50, 60 mg SC enoxaparin for a period of 24 hours	prothrombin time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), activity, antithrombin (AT), platelet count, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) complexes, or D-dimer levels	12256	12398	No significant difference was found in the PT, aPTT, AT, platelet count, fibrinogen, TAT complexes, or D-dimer levels between the four groups.
70 mg SC enoxaparin for a period of 24 hours	40, 50, 60 mg SC enoxaparin for a period of 24 hours	prothrombin time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), activity, antithrombin (AT), platelet count, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) complexes, or D-dimer levels	12256	12535	No significant difference was found in the PT, aPTT, AT, platelet count, fibrinogen, TAT complexes, or D-dimer levels between the four groups. No significant change from baseline was noted in these coagulation parameters within each group over the 24-hour study period (Table 2).
