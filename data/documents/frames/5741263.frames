Amplitude training	Placebo	Stroke duration	1358	1498	the current results showed increases in stroke duration and normalized jerk after amplitude training, which were absent in the placebo group
Amplitude training	Placebo	Writing velocity	1575	1624	velocity remained unchanged throughout the study.
Amplitude training	Placebo	Normalized jerk	14934	15189	A significant Time x Group interaction was found for the normalized jerk in the large-amplitude condition (F = 8.928, p < 0.001) (Fig 1C). Further analysis revealed a higher normalized jerk in the EXP group compared to PLB group post-training (p = 0.027).
Amplitude training	Placebo	Normalized jerk	15073	15189	Further analysis revealed a higher normalized jerk in the EXP group compared to PLB group post-training (p = 0.027).
Amplitude training	Placebo	Writing velocity	1562	1624	In contrast, velocity remained unchanged throughout the study.
Amplitude training	Placebo	Stroke duration	1284	1499	In contrast to the reported positive effects of training on writing size, the current results showed increases in stroke duration and normalized jerk after amplitude training, which were absent in the placebo group.
