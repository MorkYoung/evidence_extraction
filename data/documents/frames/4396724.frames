High-intensity interval training	Traditional moderate-intensity continuous training	Maximal heart rate at the end of the test	22392	22597	Maximal heart rate achieved at the end of the graded exercise test, body mass, and waist circumference did not change significantly from baseline to one-month follow-up in either HIIT or MICT (P's > 0.05).
High-intensity interval training	Traditional moderate-intensity continuous training	Adherence to training after 1 month	769	988	Individuals in HIIT (89 ± 11%) adhered to their prescribed protocol to a greater extent than individuals in MICT (71 ± 31%) as determined by training logs completed over one-month follow-up (P = 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.75).
High-intensity interval training	Traditional moderate-intensity continuous training	Duration of vigorous physical activity weekly	989	1162	Minutes spent in vigorous physical activity per week measured by accelerometer were higher in HIIT (24 ± 18) as compared to MICT (11 ± 10) at one-month follow-up (P = 0.049,
High-intensity interval training	Traditional moderate-intensity continuous training	Duration of vigorous physical activity weekly	989	1181	Minutes spent in vigorous physical activity per week measured by accelerometer were higher in HIIT (24 ± 18) as compared to MICT (11 ± 10) at one-month follow-up (P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 0.92).
High-intensity interval training	Traditional moderate-intensity continuous training	Changes in fitness measures	22174	22390	There were no main effects for group or group by time interactions for these fitness parameter variables, indicating that there were no differences in the degree of change experienced between HIIT and MICT over time.
