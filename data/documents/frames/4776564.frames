Hope-promoting interventions based on religious beliefs	No interventions	Quality of life score regarding satisfaction	1256	1518	The mean (standard deviation) overall QOL score in the area of satisfaction significantly increased in the study group, compared to the controls, immediately [70.7 (8.5) vs. 59.2 (12.5)] and 1 month after the intervention [75.2 (7.4) vs. 59.4 (12.9)] (P < 0.05).
Hope-promoting interventions based on religious beliefs	No interventions	Quality of life score regarding importance	1256	1718	The mean (standard deviation) overall QOL score in the area of satisfaction significantly increased in the study group, compared to the controls, immediately [70.7 (8.5) vs. 59.2 (12.5)] and 1 month after the intervention [75.2 (7.4) vs. 59.4 (12.9)] (P < 0.05). There was also a similar difference between the two groups in the area of importance immediately [73.6 (5.8) vs. 65.7 (7.5)] and 1 month after the intervention [76.3 (8.1) vs. 66.8 (8.5)] (P < 0.05).
Hope-promoting interventions based on religious beliefs	No interventions	Baseline characteristics	17355	17788	In general, the results showed that the two groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics and had no significant differences [Tables 1 and 2].
