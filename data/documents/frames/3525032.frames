laryngeal Mask (PLMA)	endotracheal intubation (ETT)	adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine values	1376	1519	no statistically significant differences were observed between and within groups when adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine values were compared
laryngeal Mask (PLMA) or endotracheal intubation (ETT)	baseline	cortisol levels 20 minutes after CO2 insufflation	12767	12974	When serum cortisol levels were compared within groups, cortisol levels 20 minutes after CO2 insufflation were significantly higher than cortisol levels after anaesthesia induction in both groups (p = 0.001)
laryngeal Mask (PLMA)	endotracheal intubation (ETT)	adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine values	1376	1520	no statistically significant differences were observed between and within groups when adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine values were compared,
laryngeal Mask (PLMA)	endotracheal intubation (ETT)	serum cortisol levels after CO2 insufflation	1521	1636	serum cortisol levels after CO2 insufflation in PLMA group were significantly lower than the ETT group (p = 0.024).
