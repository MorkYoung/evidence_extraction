Biofeedback 	Control	Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety	10925	11194	the multivariate logistic regression revealed that the greater reduction of the HAM-A score was associated with the treatment response controlling for age, BMI, and the baseline HAM-A in the biofeedback-assisted autogenic training group (OR=1.52, CI=1.01-2.33, P=0.048)
Biofeedback 	Control	Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety	10444	10536	Significant interactions between time and group were found for the HAM-A (F=10.560, P=0.003)
Biofeedback 	Control	Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory 	10444	10731	Significant interactions between time and group were found for the HAM-A (F=10.560, P=0.003), HAM-D (F=8.161, P=0.013), and STAI-S (F=12.320, P=0.002). Post hoc analysis revealed that there were significant between-group differences at the endpoint (P=0.002, 0.032, 0.001, respectively).
Biofeedback 	Control	Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression 	10444	10731	Significant interactions between time and group were found for the HAM-A (F=10.560, P=0.003), HAM-D (F=8.161, P=0.013), and STAI-S (F=12.320, P=0.002). Post hoc analysis revealed that there were significant between-group differences at the endpoint (P=0.002, 0.032, 0.001, respectively).
