Newfactan	Surfacten	Total duration of intubation - In infants by birth weight >1,500 g - treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)	13865	14086	Total duration of intubation was not significantly different between Newfactan® group and Surfacten® group (14.3±18.6 days versus 12.2±18.8 days) in <1,500 g group, as well as in ≥1,500 g group (3.7±3.2 vs. 3.6±2.6 days).
Newfactan	Surfacten	clinical efficacy (infants birth weight >1,500 g) - treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)	1508	1624	Newfactan® was comparable to Surfacten® in the clinical efficacy in the treatment of RDS in both birth weight groups
Newfactan	Surfacten	clinical efficacy (infants birth weight <1,500 g) - treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)	1490	1625	We concluded that Newfactan® was comparable to Surfacten® in the clinical efficacy in the treatment of RDS in both birth weight groups.
Newfactan	Surfacten	In ≥1,500 g group, the total doses of surfactant instilled - treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)	12699	12880	In ≥1,500 g group, the total doses of surfactant instilled were not significantly different between Newfactan® group and Surfacten® group (one dose 87 vs. 90%, two doses 13 vs. 10%)
Newfactan	Surfacten	In ≥1,500 g group, the total doses of surfactant instilled - treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)	12699	12881	In ≥1,500 g group, the total doses of surfactant instilled were not significantly different between Newfactan® group and Surfacten® group (one dose 87 vs. 90%, two doses 13 vs. 10%).
