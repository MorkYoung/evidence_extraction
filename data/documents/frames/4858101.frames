Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Change in signs	13642	13929	In the mitoxantrone group, 18/20 (90%) dogs had improvement in signs, and 2/20 (10%) had no change in signs. In the carboplatin group, 13/20 (65%) had improvement in clinical signs, and 7/20 (35%) had stable clinical signs. These differences were not statistically significant (P = .13).
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Complete response 	1088	1185	Response was not different between groups (P = .56). None of the dogs showed complete response. I
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Improvement in signs	13642	13929	In the mitoxantrone group, 18/20 (90%) dogs had improvement in signs, and 2/20 (10%) had no change in signs.

Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Gastrointestinal toxicosis	17993	18225	Overall, more dogs treated with carboplatin experienced some form of gastrointestinal toxicosis (9/35; 26%) than did dogs treated with mitoxantrone (3/38; 8%); however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .06
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Gastrointestinal toxicosis	17993	18227	Overall, more dogs treated with carboplatin experienced some form of gastrointestinal toxicosis (9/35; 26%) than did dogs treated with mitoxantrone (3/38; 8%); however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .06).
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Median survival time 	15305	15510	As rescue treatment was allowed, overall MST was not a primary endpoint but was 247.5 days when mitoxantrone was the first‐line treatment and 263 days when carboplatin was the first‐line treatment (P = .47
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Progression‐free interval	13057	13297	The PFI was not significantly different between groups and was 106 days (range 21–383 days) for the mitoxantrone‐treated group and 73.5 days (range 13–548 days) for the carboplatin‐treated group (P = .62; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.47–1.56
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Progression‐free interval	1371	1540	The PFI was not significantly different between groups (mitoxantrone = 106 days; carboplatin = 73.5 days; P = .62; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.47–1.56).
Mitoxantrone	Carboplatin	Complete response 	1141	1369	None of the dogs showed complete response. In the mitoxantrone group, there were 2 (8%) partial responses (PR) and 18 (69%) dogs with stable disease (SD). In the carboplatin group, there were 3 PR (13%) and 13 (54%) dogs with SD
