portion-controlled diet (PCD)	self-management education (DSME)	larger weight losses were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c	1363	1472	Across both groups, larger weight losses were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c (r=0.52, P<0.0001).
portion-controlled diet (PCD)	self-management education (DSME)	larger weight losses were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c	19978	20301	The two treatment conditions were combined (N=100) to examine the relationship between changes in weight and HbA1c at month 6. Partial correlation analysis, which controlled for the effect of treatment condition, revealed that the more weight participants lost (kg), the greater their reduction in HbA1c (r=0.52, P<0.0001).
portion-controlled diet (PCD)	self-management education (DSME)	body weight over 6 months in obese patients with type 2 diabetes	916	1099	after 6 months of treatment, PCD participants lost 7.3 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): −5.8 to −8.8 kg], compared with 2.2 kg (95% CI: −0.7 to −3.7 kg) in the DSME group (P<0.0001).
portion-controlled diet (PCD)	self-management education (DSME)	improvements in HbA1c after 6 months of treatment	1236	1362	HbA1c declined by 0.7% (95% CI: −0.4 to −1.0%) in the PCD group, compared with 0.4% (95% CI: −0.1 to −0.7%) in DSME (P<0.026).
portion-controlled diet (PCD)	self-management education (DSME)	Loss in initial weight	1100	1235	Significantly more PCD than DSME participants lost ⩾5% of initial weight (54.0% vs 14.0%, P<0.0001) and ⩾10% (26.0% vs 6.0%, P<0.0001).
