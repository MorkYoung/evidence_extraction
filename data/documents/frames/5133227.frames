Tube-exchanger	Control	Kinking or knotting	10723	10865	Kinking or knotting occurred in 10 patients in the control group but in none of the patients in the tube-exchanger group (P = 0.003, Table 2).
Tube-exchanger	Control	Success rate of NGT insertion	926	1101	In the tube-exchanger group, the success rate of NGT insertion on the first attempt was 92%, which is significantly higher than 68%, the rate in the control group (P = 0.007).
Tube-exchanger	Control	Tube insertion time	1102	1287	The time required for successful NGT insertion in the tube-exchanger group was 18.5 ± 8.2 seconds, which is significantly shorter than the control group, 75.1 ± 9.8 seconds (P < 0.001).
