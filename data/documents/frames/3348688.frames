triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	Connectivity and the compression strength and the maximum axial torque	3034	3147	There was no significant relation between Connectivity and the compression strength and the maximum axial torque.
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	The trabecular number	12742	13021	The trabecular number (Tb.N.) in the treatment group (A) was significantly increased compared with the control group (B). The percentage difference was 46% (P=0.004), which corresponds to an absolute increase of the mean trabecular number (Tb.N.) by 5–6 trabeculae per millimeter
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	The bending stiffness anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and the torsional stiffness 	2454	2771	The bending stiffness anterior-posterior (treatment group 17.48 Nm vs. control group 8.3 Nm), medial-lateral (treatment group 18,9 Nm vs. control group 7.92 Nm) and the torsional stiffness (treatment group 41.17N/° vs. control group 16.41N/°) are significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group.
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	The trabecular number	1889	2113	Triple injections of rhBMP-2 induced significant changes in the trabecular architecture of the regenerate compared with the control: increased trabecular number (Tb.N.) (treatment group 1.73 mm/1 vs. control group 1.2 mm/1),
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	the trabecular thickness	13323	13592	For the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), there were no significant differences between the treatment group (A) and the control group (B). The maximum trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) in treatment group (A) reached 0.39 mm compared to 0.35 mm in the control group (Figure 4).
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	the trabecular thickness	13323	13458	For the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.), there were no significant differences between the treatment group (A) and the control group (B).
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	the trabecular spacing (Th.Sp.),	13023	13322	Regarding the trabecular spacing (Th.Sp.), there were significant differences between the treatment group (A) and the control group (B). Treatment group (A) compared with control group (B) had a lower mean trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp.) by 58% (P=0.022), representing an absolute difference of 0.25 mm.
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	the trabecular spacing (Th.Sp.),	13160	13274	Treatment group (A) compared with control group (B) had a lower mean trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp.) by 58% (P=0.022),
triple injection of 1 mL rhBMP-2/NaCl (4 mg rhBMP-2/ml) (A) 	no injection (B)	The bending stiffness anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and the torsional stiffness 	13986	14255	The comparison showed an increase in torsional stiffness of the treatment group of 248% to controls (P=0.012). The anterior-posterior bending stiffness revealed an increase of 210% (P=0.007) and the medial-lateral bending stiffness showed an increase of 239% (P=0.002).
