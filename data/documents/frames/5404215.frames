control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants with higher baseline total cholesterol (TC)	1302	1346	FMD was measured at baseline and at 240 min.
3 ounces (85 g) ground peanuts	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption	17061	17175	The control shake significantly reduced FMD by 1.2% at 240 min postconsumption compared with baseline (P = 0.029).
control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants (n = 6) with a higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration (>100 mg/dL)	1893	2226	Participants with higher baseline total (>150 mg/dL) and LDL (>100 mg/dL)-cholesterol concentrations showed a significant decrease in FMD after the control meal (−1.8%, P = 0.017; −2.0%, P = 0.038), whereas the peanut meal maintained endothelial function in all participants irrespective of total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.
control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants with higher baseline total cholesterol (TC)	1741	1892	Compared with baseline, only the control meal significantly decreased FMD at 240 min (control: −1.2% ± 0.5%; P = 0.029; peanut: −0.6% ± 0.5%; P = 0.3).
control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants with higher baseline total cholesterol (TC)	17366	17577	Participants with higher baseline TC concentrations (>150.0 mg/dL; n = 9) showed a significant decrease in FMD (−1.8%; P = 0.017) 240 min after consumption of the control meal compared with baseline (Figure 3A).
control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants with higher baseline total cholesterol (TC)	1893	2090	Participants with higher baseline total (>150 mg/dL) and LDL (>100 mg/dL)-cholesterol concentrations showed a significant decrease in FMD after the control meal (−1.8%, P = 0.017; −2.0%, P = 0.038)
control meal	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD) score at 240 min postconsumption in participants (n = 6) with a higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration (>100 mg/dL)	17816	18002	Participants (n = 6) with a higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration (>100 mg/dL) showed a significant decrease in FMD (−2.0%; P = 0.038) 240 min after the control meal (Figure 3B).
