arthemeter-lumefantrine (AL) 	dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (AP)	mean Hb	16061	16292	Final mean Hb levels were 7.15 mmol/l ± 1.07 for the DP treatment group and 6.79 mmol/l ± 1.24 for the AL group. A possible influence of anaemia on gametocyte carriage at enrollment was not observed in the present study (p > 0.05).
arthemeter-lumefantrine (AL) 	dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (AP)	Adverse events	17192	17342	Most adverse events were mild, self limiting and consistent with symptoms of malaria. There was no significant difference between the two study groups
arthemeter-lumefantrine (AL) 	dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (AP)	Gametocyte dynamics	19721	19842	There was no difference between children older than 60 months and younger as regards carriage of gametocytes and density.
