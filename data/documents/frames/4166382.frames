Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Nausea 	8135	8333	Patients in group S experienced significantly more nausea for 24 hours postoperation than patients in group C (54.5% vs. 31.8%, P = 0.014) (Fig. 1). However, this trend was not observed for vomiting
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Use of rescue antiemetic	8335	8435	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea, rescue antiemetic use
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Use of rescue antiemetic	8335	8513	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea, rescue antiemetic use, incidence of adverse effects, or patient satisfaction between the two groups
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Nausea 	8135	8283	Patients in group S experienced significantly more nausea for 24 hours postoperation than patients in group C (54.5% vs. 31.8%, P = 0.014) (Fig. 1).
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Vomiting	1160	1350	The incidence of PONV 24 hours postoperatively was significantly lower in the continuous palonosetron infusion group than the single-injection palonosetron group (31.8 vs. 56.1%, P = 0.009).
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Adverse effects	8335	8513	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea, rescue antiemetic use, incidence of adverse effects, or patient satisfaction between the two groups
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Patient satisfaction	8335	8513	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea, rescue antiemetic use, incidence of adverse effects, or patient satisfaction between the two groups
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Severity of nausea	8335	8412	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea
Continuous palonosetron infusion	Single-injection palonosetron	Severity of nausea	8335	8513	No statistically significant differences were found in the severity of nausea, rescue antiemetic use, incidence of adverse effects, or patient satisfaction between the two groups
