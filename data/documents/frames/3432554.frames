Coenzyme Q10	Control	Reduced blood CoQ10 (ubiquinol)	18865	19008	However, treatment with CoQ10 resulted in a significant increase in total blood CoQ10 (138%; P = 0.02) and reduced blood CoQ10 (168%; P = 0.02)
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Exercise performance 	840	1089	Treatment with CoQ10 resulted in a significant increase in total blood CoQ10 (138%; P = 0.02) and reduced blood CoQ10 (168%; P = 0.02), but did not improve exercise performance (with the exception of selected individuals) or impact oxidative stress.
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Oxidative stress	18695	18863	No differences were noted between CoQ10 supplementation and placebo for measures of oxidative stress at rest, before and after the 4-week intervention period (P > 0.05)
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Total blood CoQ10	840	933	Treatment with CoQ10 resulted in a significant increase in total blood CoQ10 (138%; P = 0.02)
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Cycle sprint total work	19489	19716	the relationship between the percentage change in total blood CoQ10 and exercise performance (placebo versus CoQ10 supplement) was noted for GXT time (R2 = 0.0744; P = 0.35) and cycle sprint total work (R2 = 0.6009; P = 0.001).
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Cycle sprint total work	19438	19716	Although not a main focus of the present research, the relationship between the percentage change in total blood CoQ10 and exercise performance (placebo versus CoQ10 supplement) was noted for GXT time (R2 = 0.0744; P = 0.35) and cycle sprint total work (R2 = 0.6009; P = 0.001).
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Oxidative stress	19818	19938	No differences were noted between CoQ10 and placebo for measures of oxidative stress in response to exercise (P > 0.05),
Coenzyme Q10	Control	Maximal graded exercise test improvement	17246	17380	No differences were noted between CoQ10 and placebo for exercise performance and related variables (heart rate and perceived exertion)
