OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Mean procedure time	1012	1165	An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P<0.007
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Pain scores recorded by physicians	11471	11634	Other secondary endpoints which significantly favored the OBM group included the mean pain scores recorded by the fellows (P<0.002) and by the attendings (P<0.008)
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Mean length of the specimens	841	1011	The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P<0.003.
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Patient willingness to repeat the produce	11847	11956	However, patients indicated a greater willingness to have a repeat OBM (1.0) than a repeat SBM (2.9), P<0.03.
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Mean procedure time	10462	10603	The mean procedure time, a secondary endpoint, was significantly shorter in the OBM group (175 s) compared to the SBM group (292 s), P<0.007.
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Pain scores recorded by physicians	11471	11635	Other secondary endpoints which significantly favored the OBM group included the mean pain scores recorded by the fellows (P<0.002) and by the attendings (P<0.008).
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Patient willingness to repeat the produce	11856	11956	patients indicated a greater willingness to have a repeat OBM (1.0) than a repeat SBM (2.9), P<0.03.
OnControl Bone Marrow Biopsy System	Standard marrow needle	Pain scores recorded by patients	11636	11846	In regard to the mean pain scores reported by the patients in the 2 study groups, a lower score was tabulated in the OBM group (4.7) than in the SBM group (5.9), but the difference was not significant (P=0.11).
