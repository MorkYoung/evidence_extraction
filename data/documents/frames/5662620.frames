Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Negative emotions or total mental health difficulties	39926	40161	There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in changes in negative emotions, F(1,171) = 1.78, p = 0.19, η2 = 0.05, and in total mental health difficulties, F(1,171) = 1.63, p = 0.18, η2 = 0.04.
Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Prosocial behavior	39698	39925	For prosocial behavior, we also found a significant increase in the intervention group, F(1,171) = 7.29, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.03, (M = 1.15, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.66), while there was no significant change in the control group.
Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Subjective well-being	1292	1477	The findings showed significant increases in subjective well-being and positive learning behaviors among the intervention participants, with no significant changes in the control group.
Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Positive learning behaviors	1292	1477	The findings showed significant increases in subjective well-being and positive learning behaviors among the intervention participants, with no significant changes in the control group.
Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Positive emotions	39380	39697	Analyses of the parent-report data showed a similar pattern for children's positive emotions of time x intervention significant effect, F(1,171) = 9.11, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.02, with significant increases in the intervention group (M = 2.72, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.81), and no significant changes in the control group.
Positive psychology-based intervention	Wait-list control 	Positive emotions	38320	39079	Analyses of the self-report outcomes showed significant interaction effects between intervention and time (pre- and post-intervention) on children's positive emotions, F(1,313) = 10.93, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.04, life satisfaction, F(1,313) = 9.68, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.03, and empathy, F(1,313) = 8.65, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.03, but not on negative emotions, F(1,313) = 1.83, p = 0.18, η2 = 0.007. Post hoc t-test comparisons revealed that children in the intervention group showed significant pre- to post-intervention increases in positive emotions (M = 0.84, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.38), life satisfaction (M = 0.46, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.67) and empathy (M = 2.01, p = 0.003, Cohen's d = 0.34), with no significant changes in these measures in the control group.
