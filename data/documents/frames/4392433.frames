Vorapaxar	placebo	urgent coronary revascularization	12239	12428	The rate of CV death, MI, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization was 10.1% in the vorapaxar group, as compared with 11.8% in the placebo group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001)
Vorapaxar	placebo	stroke	1057	1232	Vorapaxar also significantly reduced the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization (10.1% versus 11.8%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001),
Vorapaxar	placebo	CV death	12239	12428	The rate of CV death, MI, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization was 10.1% in the vorapaxar group, as compared with 11.8% in the placebo group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001)

Vorapaxar	placebo	CV death	1057	1281	Vorapaxar also significantly reduced the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization (10.1% versus 11.8%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001), as well as the rate of CV death or MI (P<0.001).
Vorapaxar	placebo	long�term secondary prevention of thrombotic CV events	1592	1822	In patients with prior MI or PAD who have not had a previous stroke or TIA, vorapaxar added to standard therapy is effective for long‐term secondary prevention of thrombotic CV events, while increasing moderate or severe bleeding.
Vorapaxar	placebo	Myocardial Infarction	1057	1232	Vorapaxar also significantly reduced the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization (10.1% versus 11.8%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001),
Vorapaxar	placebo	moderate or severe bleeding	1592	1822	In patients with prior MI or PAD who have not had a previous stroke or TIA, vorapaxar added to standard therapy is effective for long‐term secondary prevention of thrombotic CV events, while increasing moderate or severe bleeding.
Vorapaxar	placebo	Myocardial Infarction	12239	12428	The rate of CV death, MI, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization was 10.1% in the vorapaxar group, as compared with 11.8% in the placebo group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; P<0.001)
