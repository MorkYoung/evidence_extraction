Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training plus general rehabilitation therapy	Home program plus general rehabilitation therapy	Movement time of the elbow	1373	1638	After pre- and post-training control group, MV improved significantlyin reaching movement of only comfortable speed (p<0.05). Between two groups, MT and MAV of the elbow at comfortable speed and NJS of the elbow at fast speed were statisticallysignificant (p<0.05).
Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training plus general rehabilitation therapy	Home program plus general rehabilitation therapy	Movement time of the elbow	1158	1363	fter pre- and post-training experimental group, MT, MV, NJS, MAV of shoulder, elbow, wrist and NJS of elbow and wrist improved significantlyin reaching movement of both comfortable and fast speed (p<0.05).
Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training plus general rehabilitation therapy	Home program plus general rehabilitation therapy	Mean angular velocity of the wrist	12600	12829	In the comparison of motion between experimental and control groups, there was a significant difference in the movement time, angular velocity of wrist of comfortable speed and normalizedjerk score of elbow at fast speed (p<0.05)
