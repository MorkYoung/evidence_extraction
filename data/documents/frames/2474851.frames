Clinical full model	Clinical base model	AUC for predicting prostate cancer at biopsy	18017	18173	the AUC of the clinical full model was 0.84 (p < 0.0005 compared with the clinical base model and p = 0.025 compared with clinical base model plus free PSA)
Clinical full model	Clinical base model + free PSA	AUC for predicting prostate cancer at biopsy	17373	17755	The AUC of the laboratory base model (age+total PSA) was 0.68. Addition of all markers enhanced the AUC of the laboratory base model to 0.83. Predictive accuracy of the full model was higher than that of the base model (p < 0.0005); because free PSA is widely used in clinical practice, we also compared the AUC of the full model to that of the base model plus free PSA (p = 0.005).
