iPad-based software platform	control	Cognitive Linguistic Quick Test (CLQT), executive function subtest, visuospatial skill subtest, Composite Severity score	56927	57363	On the CLQT, the experimental participants showed an improvement of 10.92 percentage points on the attention subtest (t = −1.93, p < 0.05), an improvement of 5.06 percentage points on the executive function subtest (t = −2.74, p < 0.01), an improvement of 6.89 percentage points on the visuospatial skill subtest (t = −3.45, p < 0.001), and an improvement of 5.26 percentage points on the Composite Severity score (t = −3.10, p < 0.01).
iPad-based software platform	control	Revised-Western Aphasia Battery (R-WAB)	56757	56926	On the R-WAB they showed an improvement of 2.15 points on the CQ subtest (t = −2.16, p < 0.05) and an improvement of 3.18 points on the AQ subtest (t = −2.89, p < 0.01).
iPad-based software platform	control	Revised-Western Aphasia Battery (R-WAB)	48093	48317	A positive effect of R-WAB AQ means that participants with higher AQ scores than average (refer to experimental participants who fall to the right of the vertical dotted line in Figure 2) showed more improvement on the task.
iPad-based software platform	control	terms of the duration of therapy	39178	39425	The two groups did not differ in terms of the duration of therapy: control participants had an average of 11 weeks (SD = 2.2) in therapy and experimental participants had an average 11.5 weeks (SD = 2.5) in therapy (t = 1.12, p = 0.78, Figure 5)6.
