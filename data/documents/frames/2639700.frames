groups with exercise energy expenditure of 4 , 8 , or 12 kcal/kg/week (KKW)	control group	percent change in fitness	18446	18661	4, 8 and 12 KKW groups having a 3.7 (95% CI:1.9, 5.4), 6.9 (4.7, 9.2), and 8.0 (5.9, 10.2) percent change in fitness, respectively, each of which was statistically significant (p<0.001) compared to the control group
non-exercise control group	groups with exercise energy expenditure of 4 , 8 , or 12 kcal/kg/week (KKW)	mean weekly steps during the first month	17650	17914	There were no significant differences in mean weekly steps during the first month among any of the exercise intervention groups, but the non-exercise control group (6098 (2065)) had significantly (P<0.05 for each) more steps compared to all of the exercise groups.
groups with exercise energy expenditure of 4 , 8 , or 12 kcal/kg/week (KKW)	control group	percent change in fitness	18290	18687	Also similar to previous reports from the full study cohort there was a dose response in change in fitness (P-trend<0.001) across the study groups with the 4, 8 and 12 KKW groups having a 3.7 (95% CI:1.9, 5.4), 6.9 (4.7, 9.2), and 8.0 (5.9, 10.2) percent change in fitness, respectively, each of which was statistically significant (p<0.001) compared to the control group (−2.7 (−4.9, −0.6)).
