Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis intensity(outside OR)	9332	9493	Outside the OR, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence, episodes, and intensity of nasal bleeding between the two groups (Table 3).
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis (Overall)	8621	8881	Overall, 40 of 66 (60.6%) patients in the LMA group and 36 of 68 (52.9%) patients in the ETT group experienced nasal bleeding within the whole study period. There was no significant difference between two groups (RD = −7.7%; 95% CI: −24.4% to 9.1%; P = 0.371).
Endotracheal tube	Laryngeal mask 	Epistaxis first episode (outside OR)	892	1097	However, outside the OR, the incidence of the first episode of postoperative nasal bleeding in the LMA group was higher than that in the ETT group (difference: −26.5%; 95% CI: −42.2% to −10.7%; P < 0.001).
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis (inside OR)	8883	9049	In the OR, the incidence of nasal bleeding in the ETT group was significantly higher than that in the LMA group (RD = 18.8%, 95% CI: 5.7% to 31.9%; P = 0.007; Table 2
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis (inside OR)	8883	9051	In the OR, the incidence of nasal bleeding in the ETT group was significantly higher than that in the LMA group (RD = 18.8%, 95% CI: 5.7% to 31.9%; P = 0.007; Table 2).
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis (Overall)	726	849	The overall incidence of postoperative nasal bleeding throughout the observation period was similar between the two groups.
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis episodes (outside OR)	9332	9493	Outside the OR, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence, episodes, and intensity of nasal bleeding between the two groups (Table 3).
Laryngeal mask 	Endotracheal tube	Epistaxis insidence (outside OR)	9332	9493	Outside the OR, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence, episodes, and intensity of nasal bleeding between the two groups (Table 3).
Endotracheal tube	Laryngeal mask 	Epistaxis first episode (outside OR)	9711	9893	Thus, outside the OR, the incidence of the first episode of epistaxis in the ETT group was lower than that in the LMA group (RD: −26.5%; 95% CI: −42.2% to −10.7%; P < 0.001; Table 3)
