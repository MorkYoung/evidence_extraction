~1100 kJ/d of hazelnuts, potato crisps	control	waist circumference	23290	23520	Those with higher BMI reduced their waist circumference in the nut group (P = 0.005) and (to a lesser extent) in the potato crisp group (P = 0.032) compared to the control group where the association was in the opposite direction.
~1100 kJ/d of hazelnuts	chocolate	Plasma total cholesterol	23930	24113	Plasma total cholesterol in the hazelnut group was lower compared to the chocolate group (P = 0.006), with a tendency for the hazelnut group to be lower than the control (P  = 0.057).
~1100 kJ/d of hazelnuts,	chocolate, or potato crisps, control	total energy derived from saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) and carbohydrate	22250	22469	The results from pairwise comparison showed that the percentage of total energy derived from SAFA (all P ≤ 0.045) and carbohydrate (all P ≤ 0.006) in the hazelnut group was significantly lower than all the other groups.
~1100 kJ/d of hazelnuts,	chocolate, or potato crisps, control	differences in the changes of the anthropometric measurements, RMR, and physical activity level	22860	23155	Although there was an apparent decrease in physical activity level in the control group, there were no statistically significant differences in the changes of the anthropometric measurements, RMR, and physical activity level from baseline to 12 weeks between the groups (all P ≥ 0.106, Table 3).
