assigned to the high-protein diet who carried the AA genotype of FTO rs1558902	assigned to the high-protein diet without this genotype	total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat	14395	14720	We observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the high-protein diet. When assigned to the high-protein diet, participants who carried the AA genotype had greater loss in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat than those without this genotype.

assigned to the dietary fat components who carried the AA genotype of FTO rs1558902	assigned to the dietary fat components without this genotype	total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat	13862	14144	We did not find significant genetic effects and interactions on changes in fat distribution in subgroups treated by different dietary fat components (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).Similar results were found in the white participants (data not shown).
