Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	Disease-free survival for metastases < 3cm	850	1000	In the 226 patients with solitary CRLM < 3 cm, OS and DFS rates did not differ between the RFA group and the resection group (P = 0.962 and P = 0.980)
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	5-year disease-free survival 	13030	13239	However, DFS in the RFA group was significantly lower than the other groups (P = 0.037). The 5-year DFS rate was 6.4% in the RFA group, 16.2% in the resection group, and 18.4% in the combination therapy group.
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	5-year overall survival 	850	1001	In the 226 patients with solitary CRLM < 3 cm, OS and DFS rates did not differ between the RFA group and the resection group (P = 0.962 and P = 0.980).
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	Disease-free survival for metastases ≥ 3 cm	1002	1142	In the 70 patients with solitary CRLM ≥ 3 cm, DFS was significantly lower in the RFA group as compared with the resection group (P = 0.015).
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	Disease-free survival for metastases ≥ 3 cm	12409	12643	Among the 70 patients with solitary metastatic tumor ≥3 cm (14 patients in the RFA group and 56 patients in the resection group), DFS rates were significantly lower in the RFA group (RFA group, 23.1%; resection group, 36.6%; P = 0.01)
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	Disease-free survival for metastases < 3cm	850	999	In the 226 patients with solitary CRLM < 3 cm, OS and DFS rates did not differ between the RFA group and the resection group (P = 0.962 and P = 0.980
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	5-year overall survival 	13388	13600	The 5-year OS rate was 47.6% in the RFA group and 56.0% in the resection group (P = 0.308). There was no statistical difference in 5-year DFS between the RFA and the resection groups (32.2% vs. 34.0%, P = 0.164).
Radiofrequency ablation	Hepatic resection	Overall survival for metastases < 3cm	850	1000	In the 226 patients with solitary CRLM < 3 cm, OS and DFS rates did not differ between the RFA group and the resection group (P = 0.962 and P = 0.980)
