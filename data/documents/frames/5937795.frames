confinement housing	box stalls	oocysts shedding	1504	1718	Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between CFC and IC samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1).
confinement housing	box stalls	serum total protein	26662	26735	There were no differences in serum total protein across groups (P = 0.7),
confinement housing	box stalls	supportive care	1719	1902	Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls.
confinement housing	box stalls	physically and metabolically decompensated	44301	44423	calves in confinement housing were substantially more physically and metabolically decompensated than calves in box stalls
confinement housing	box stalls	plasma cortisol	1719	1827	Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001)
confinement housing	box stalls	serum total protein	26662	26734	There were no differences in serum total protein across groups (P = 0.7)
confinement housing	box stalls	physically and metabolically decompensated	44269	44424	Our findings also indicate that calves in confinement housing were substantially more physically and metabolically decompensated than calves in box stalls.
