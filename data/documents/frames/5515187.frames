6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	average of physical activity	18436	18763	So that the intervention group immediately after intervention have a higher average of physical activity than the control group (P < 0.001). Although there is not any significant differences between immediately after intervention and 6 months later in terms of physical activity in the intervention group (P = 0.120) (Table 2).
6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	systolic and diastolic BP	1684	1813	After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.
6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	average of physical activity	1493	1683	After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (< 0.001) and physical activity (< 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group.
6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	systolic and diastolic BP	19298	19436	there is a significant difference in diastolic BP between the groups (P = 0.010) and follow-up time in the intervention group (P = 0.013).
6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	systolic and diastolic BP	-1	-1	As shown in table 3, results show that there is a significant difference between systolic BP of intervention and control group overall (P = 0.045).<NEWLINE> <NEWLINE><NEWLINE> <NEWLINE>Trend of these changes is significant in two groups too (P < 0.001) so that systolic BP decrease as 7 mmHg in the intervention group, while this decrease is 3 mmHg in control group after 6 months (P < 0.001).
6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring	routine care from health-care center	self-efficacy	17351	17644	As shown in table 2, a significant difference is in the mean of self-efficacy between the groups (P < 0.001) and follow-up time (P < 0.001). So that the mean of self-efficacy improve immediately after intervention and 6 months later in comparison to control group after adjusting for baseline.
