Glutamine 	Control	Creatin kinase	16137	16289	CK values increased across time for two groups from baseline (Fig. 4). However no significant differences were found between groups at any point in time
Glutamine 	Control	Creatin kinase	1496	1567	The difference of CK level between the groups was also not significant.
