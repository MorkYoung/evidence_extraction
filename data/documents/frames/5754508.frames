LPS exposure	Saline axposure	macrophage activation	-1	-1	The mean concentration of sCD163 was comparable at baseline (placebo and LPS at time = 0 min, P = 0.78) but increased rapidly 2–3-fold and remained elevated throughout the study period during LPS conditions compared with placebo (Fig. 1, two-way repeated measure ANOVA interaction P < 0.001).
LPS exposure	Saline axposure	macrophage activation	171	231	Macrophage activation determined by levels of soluble sCD163
LPS exposure	placebo exposure	concentration of sCD163	-1	-1	The mean concentration of sCD163 was comparable at baseline (placebo and LPS at time = 0 min, P = 0.78) but increased rapidly 2–3-fold and remained elevated throughout the study period during LPS conditions compared with placebo (Fig. 1, two-way repeated measure ANOVA interaction P < 0.001)
LPS exposure	Saline axposure	macrophage activation	1224	1747	We observed a significant two-fold increase in plasma sCD163 levels following LPS exposure (P < 0.001), and sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with the plasma concentration of free fatty acids, Rapalmitate, lipid oxidation rates and phosphorylation of the hormone-sensitive lipase at serine 660 in adipose tissue (P < 0.05, all). Furthermore, sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with plasma concentrations of cortisol, glucagon, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 (P < 0.05, all).
LPS exposure	placebo exposure	concentration of sCD163	1224	1562	We observed a significant two-fold increase in plasma sCD163 levels following LPS exposure (P < 0.001), and sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with the plasma concentration of free fatty acids, Rapalmitate, lipid oxidation rates and phosphorylation of the hormone-sensitive lipase at serine 660 in adipose tissue (P < 0.05, all).
