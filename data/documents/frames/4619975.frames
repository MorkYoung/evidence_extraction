Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Endogenous opioids	9499	9585	none of the endogenous opioids showed statistically significant differences (P > 0.05)
Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Endogenous opioids	9490	9636	Although none of the endogenous opioids showed statistically significant differences (P > 0.05), they all expressed increasing trends in the EXPg.
Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Expression of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)	1382	1516	SP and CGRP were identified in dental pulp after seven days of controlled orthodontic intrusion movement, even in the absence of pain.
Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Expression of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)	559	781	two different groups: the asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg), which would undergo controlled intrusive force for seven days, and the control group (CTRg), which was used to determine the basal levels of each substance.
Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Expression of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)	9319	9488	In CTRg basal levels of both neuropeptides and endogenous opioids were observed. In the EXPg, SP and CGRP exhibited statistically significant different levels (P < 0.05)
Asymptomatic inflammation group (EXPg)	Control group (CTRg)	Expression of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)	1150	1232	In the EXPg, the SP and CGRP exhibited statistically significant different levels.
