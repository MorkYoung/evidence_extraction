Standard therapy	baseline	Barthel Index (BI) score	14313	14511	The result of this study on BI score after standard therapy showed significant increment, where BI score before treatment was 60 ± 23.45 and after treatment was 75 ± 22.55, with p = 0.001 (Table 2).
Bromelin 500 mg	baseline	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) level	12880	13168	The result of this study on MMP9 after Bromelin 500 mg administration showed significant decrement of the MMP9 level. The mean of MMP9 before treatment was 6.02 ± 0.32 ng/ml and after treatment was 5.50 ± 0.4 ng/ml, where the decrement was statistically significant (p = 0.028) (Table 2).

Bromelin 500 mg	baseline	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) level	948	1102	The Bromelin group showed a significant decrement of MMP9 level, from 6.02 ± 0.32 ng/ml before treatment to 5.50 ± 0.94 ng/ml after treatment (p = 0.028).
Standard therapy	baseline	modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score	14136	14311	This study result on mRS score in standard group revealed changes, where before treatment, the mRS score was 3 ± 0.949 and after treatment was 3 ± 1.033 (p = 0.002) (Table 2).
Standard group	baseline	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) level	1252	1354	the Standard group showed increased MMP9 level from 5.82 ± 0.71 ng/ml to 5.91 ± 0.83 ng/ml (p = 0.616)
