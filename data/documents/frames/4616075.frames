Bodyweight-based exercise with blood flow restriction	Bodyweight-based exercise groups	Changes in 180°/sec peak torque/body weight (%) at the flexor of both knees	5006	5188	An isokinetic knee muscular function test was performed using a HUMAC NORM System (Cybex <NEWLINE>770-NORM®, Cybex International, Medway, MA, USA), and it measured muscular <NEWLINE>strength and power
Bodyweight-based exercise with blood flow restriction	Bodyweight-based exercise groups	Changes in 180°/sec peak torque/body weight (%) at the flexor of both knees	6955	7041	Isokinetic knee muscular function was compared between the BFR and WBE groups (Table 1
Bodyweight-based exercise with blood flow restriction	Bodyweight-based exercise groups	Isokinetic knee muscular function	-1	-1	There was no significant difference between the two groups in isokinetic knee muscular function (p < 0.05).
Bodyweight-based exercise with blood flow restriction	Bodyweight-based exercise groups	Changes in 180°/sec peak torque/body weight (%) at the flexor of both knees	719	877	The peak torque/ body weight (%) of the knee flexor and extensor was <NEWLINE>measured using a HUMAC NORM System (Cybex 770-NORM®, Cybex International, <NEWLINE>Medway, MA, USA
Bodyweight-based exercise with blood flow restriction	Bodyweight-based exercise groups	Thighs circumferences 	-1	-1	In comparison between the BFR and WBE groups, the circumferences of both thighs in the BFR group increased significantly (p < 0.001, p < 0.01) after the exercise compared with before the exercise.
