XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	aderse effects	18042	18334	Patients in both groups well tolerated the interventions. General adverse events were spontaneously reported in 90 patients (32%) during the study: 42 patients (29%) in HMWHA group experienced 63 adverse events whereas 48 patients (35%) in XLHA group experienced 73 adverse events (P = 0.295)
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	vital sign change	20156	20215	No clinically significant changes were found in vital signs
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	aderse effects	18190	18335	42 patients (29%) in HMWHA group experienced 63 adverse events whereas 48 patients (35%) in XLHA group experienced 73 adverse events (P = 0.295).
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	vital sign change	20156	20260	No clinically significant changes were found in vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	local reaction	19491	19647	The proportions of patients experiencing local reactions after HMWHA administration did not differ from those after placebo administration in the XLHA group
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	Weight bearing pain	-1	-1	The changes in WBP from baseline to Visit 5, 6, and 7 in PPS are shown in Fig. 2. Significant reduction in WBP was observed at 1 week after the last injection and it was further evident at week 6 and week 12. The changes observed at 12 weeks after the last injection were still significant in both groups and the two-sided 95% CI for between-group difference was from −1.9 mm to 10.1 mm. Analysis with FAS also showed similar results: −28 mm in HMWHA and. -32 mm in XLHA; 95% CI, (−1.3 mm, 9.2 mm). As the lower bound of 95% CI was greater than the preset margin (−10 mm), the non-inferiority of XLHA to HMWHA was demonstrated
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	Weight bearing pain	1317	1556	Mean changes of WBP at 12 weeks after the last injection were −33.3 mm with XLHA and −29.2 mm with HMWHA, proving non-inferiority of XLHA to HMWHA as the lower bound of 95% CI (−1.9 mm, 10.1 mm) was well above the predefined margin (−10 mm
XLHA, single injection form	HMWHA, thrice injection form	local reaction	19330	19744	The incidence of local injection site reactions which occurred within for 7 days after each injection were similar in the two groups (P = 0.29-0.94, (Table 7)). The proportions of patients experiencing local reactions after HMWHA administration did not differ from those after placebo administration in the XLHA group. In addition, the rates did not increase with the subsequent injection of XLHA on the third week
