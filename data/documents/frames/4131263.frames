reboxetine	citalopram	Using structural mean modelling (SMM) approach for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores	1355	1567	There was no <NEWLINE>evidence of a difference in efficacy when differential non-adherence was accounted for <NEWLINE>using the SMM approach for mean BDI (–0.29, 95% CI –3.04 to 2.46, <NEWLINE>p = 0.84) or the other mental health outcomes.
reboxetine	citalopram	Using structural mean modelling (SMM) approach for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores	-1	-1	. There was no evidence of a difference in efficacy when differential non-adherence was accounted for using the SMM approach for mean BDI (–0.29, 95% CI –3.04 to 2.46, p = 0.84)
reboxetine	citalopram	physical health (SF-12 physical subscale score)	-1	-1	There was little evidence for any difference in outcome in terms of physical health (SF-12 physical subscale score) between those randomized to receive reboxetine compared to citalopram (Table 2).
reboxetine	citalopram	Using of Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores	1100	1353	In ITT analysis, there was only <NEWLINE>weak evidence that those on reboxetine had a slightly worse outcome than those on <NEWLINE>citalopram [adjusted difference in mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores: 1.19, <NEWLINE>95% confidence interval (CI) –0.52 to 2.90, p = 0.17]
