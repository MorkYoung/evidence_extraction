training group (group T)	control group (group C)	6-min walking test (6MWT) distance	13336	13782	At baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups, while at the end of the 8-week intervention, an increase of 45 m (from 445.6 ± 89.05 to 491.06 ± 68.44 m, P = 0.0001) was observed in the training group but not in the control group (from 464.0 ± 66.39 to 464.4 ± 57.81 m, P = 0.957). At the end of the study, statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P = 0.001) [Table 3].

(P < 0.001) and statistically significant decrease in dyspnea from 3.76 ± 0.64 to 1.13 ± 0.36 (P = 0.0001) in the training group but not in the control group.
