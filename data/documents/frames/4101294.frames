CT-PFNECII plus second-line chemotherapy (combination group)	Second-line chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group)	Baseline characteristics	-1	-1	baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the treatment groups
CT-PFNECII plus second-line chemotherapy (combination group)	Second-line chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group)	Median survival	1241	1446	Compared with patients in the chemotherapy group, patients in the combination group had significantly longer PFS (5.4 months vs 3.0 months, P < .01) and median survival (9.5 months vs 5.3 months, P < .01).
CT-PFNECII plus second-line chemotherapy (combination group)	Second-line chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group)	Baseline characteristics	-1	-1	The overall study population had a median age of 56 years (range = 32-76 years), and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the treatment groups
