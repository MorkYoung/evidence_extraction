lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	number of times that a gag reflex was triggered in the presence of sedation	16147	16547	Subgroup analysis for presence of sedation (223 cases) revealed almost no differences between the 2 groups in the number of pharyngeal observation sites (8.48 ± 2.16 vs. 8.79 ± 1.85, P = 0.25), pain evaluated by VAS (1.08 ± 2.06 vs. 1.33 ± 2.16, P = 0.79), pharyngeal observation time (73.3 ± 36.6 vs. 68.3 ± 30.9 seconds, P = 0.14), and number of gag reflexes (2.02 ± 2.44 vs. 1.86 ± 2.45, P = 0.63)
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	percentage of images of suitable quality at the right pyriform sinus	18009	18186	The percentage of suitable quality images at the right pyriform sinus was significantly lower in the spray group compared to the combination group (82.8 % vs. 91.2 %, P = 0.02).
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	pain evaluated by VAS in the presence of sedation	16147	16558	Subgroup analysis for presence of sedation (223 cases) revealed almost no differences between the 2 groups in the number of pharyngeal observation sites (8.48 ± 2.16 vs. 8.79 ± 1.85, P = 0.25), pain evaluated by VAS (1.08 ± 2.06 vs. 1.33 ± 2.16, P = 0.79), pharyngeal observation time (73.3 ± 36.6 vs. 68.3 ± 30.9 seconds, P = 0.14), and number of gag reflexes (2.02 ± 2.44 vs. 1.86 ± 2.45, P = 0.63) (Table 4).
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	number of times that a gag reflex was triggered in absence of sedation	16895	17036	The number of gag reflexes was significantly higher in the spray group than in the combination group (2.35 ± 2.87 vs. 1.27 ± 1.79), P = 0.03)
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	occurrence of adverse events	15482	15698	There were almost no differences in adverse events, decrease of SpO2 (2.55 % vs. 5.29 %, P = 0.20), decrease of blood pressure (0 % vs. 1.76 %, P = 0.27), and bradycardia (0 % vs. 0 %, P = 1.00) between the 2 groups.
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	pain evaluated by VAS in the presence of sedation	15216	15481	There were almost no differences in pain evaluated by VAS (2.27 ± 2.88 vs. 2.33 ± 2.63, P = 0.85), pharyngeal observation time (72.0 ± 34.7 vs. 67.0 ± 27.8 seconds, P = 0.15), and the number of gag reflexes (2.12 ± 2.58 vs. 1.68 ± 2.27, P = 0.10) in the two groups.
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	pain evaluated by VAS in the presence of sedation	16147	16547	Subgroup analysis for presence of sedation (223 cases) revealed almost no differences between the 2 groups in the number of pharyngeal observation sites (8.48 ± 2.16 vs. 8.79 ± 1.85, P = 0.25), pain evaluated by VAS (1.08 ± 2.06 vs. 1.33 ± 2.16, P = 0.79), pharyngeal observation time (73.3 ± 36.6 vs. 68.3 ± 30.9 seconds, P = 0.14), and number of gag reflexes (2.02 ± 2.44 vs. 1.86 ± 2.45, P = 0.63)
lidocaine spray	lidocaine spray and viscous solution	number of times that a gag reflex was triggered in the presence of sedation	-1	-1	There were no differences in pain, observation time, or number of gag reflexes between the 2 groups. Subgroup analysis of the presence of sedation revealed no differences between the two groups for the number of pharyngeal observation sites and the number of gag reflexes.
