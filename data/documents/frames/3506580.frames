Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	Individual patient responses	23545	23715	All patients reported that their back pain remained unchanged in intensity and quality after each stimulation session compared to baseline assessment as given in Table 1.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	PREPOST, STIM and BLOCK 	17206	17498	There was no significant difference of the perceived mean pain intensity before and after tDCS stimulation for the factors time (PREPOST: F(1,13) = 0.85; p = 0.374) and stimulation modality (STIM: F(2,26) = 0.93; p = 0.379) and no interaction between STIM*PREPOST (F(2,26) = 1.18; p = 0.323).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	Individual patient responses	23367	23499	Individual patient responses are shown in Table 3. There were no significant distribution differences (P = 0.762) for a 30% cut-off.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	mean pain intensity	17206	17498	There was no significant difference of the perceived mean pain intensity before and after tDCS stimulation for the factors time (PREPOST: F(1,13) = 0.85; p = 0.374) and stimulation modality (STIM: F(2,26) = 0.93; p = 0.379) and no interaction between STIM*PREPOST (F(2,26) = 1.18; p = 0.323).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	PREPOST, STIM and BLOCK 	22843	23304	Likewise, a three factor repeated measures ANOVA using non-normalized data across all 10 blocks did not yield significant results for the factors PREPOST: F(1,11) = 1.67; p = 0.222) STIM (F(2,22) = 0.56; p = 0.509) and BLOCK (F(9,99) = 2.87; p = 0.103) and the corresponding interactions (STIM*PREPOST: F(2,22) = 0.13; p = 0.767; STIM*BLOCK: F(18,198) = 0.70; p = 0.554; PREPOST*BLOCK: F(9,99) = 1.86; p = 0.188; STIM*PREPOST*BLOCK: F(18,198) = 1.1; p = 0.363).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	PREPOST, STIM and BLOCK 	21562	21788	No significant difference of mean heat pain intensity over all 10 blocks before and after tDCS (PREPOST: F(1,11) = 2.09; p = 0.176) and between stimulation modalities (STIM: F(2,22) = 0.47; p = 0.555) could be found (Table 4).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	heat pain thresholds (HPT)	20950	21120	There were no significant differences of HPT before and after tDCS (PREPOST: F(1,9) = 0.82; p = 0.389) and between treatment modalities (STIM: F(2,18) = 1.27; p = 0.306).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	Individual patient responses	1013	1315	No significant alterations of pain ratings were found. Modalities of quantitative sensory testing remained equally unchanged. It is therefore hypothesized that a single 15 mins session of tDCS at 1 mA may not be sufficient to alter the perception of experimental pain and in patients with chronic pain.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	Individual patient responses	18088	18222	Individual patient responses are shown in Table 3. There were no significant distribution differences for the 30% cut-off (P = 0.093).
