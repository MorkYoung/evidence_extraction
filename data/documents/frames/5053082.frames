Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Physical restraint use per week during training 	1155	1421	Results showed that MBPBS was significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their perceived psychological stress, and to reduce the use of physical restraints and stat medications for aggressive behavior of the individuals in their care.
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Perceived Stress	1155	1296	Results showed that MBPBS was significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their perceived psychological stress
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Use of STAT medications per week after training	1175	1421	MBPBS was significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their perceived psychological stress, and to reduce the use of physical restraints and stat medications for aggressive behavior of the individuals in their care.
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Use of STAT medications per week during training	34131	34353	During the Training phase, there was no statistically significant difference in mean use of stat medications per week between the MBPBS (M = 6.40, SD = 3.24) and TAU conditions (M = 8.60, SD = 2.37), t(18) = 1.73, p = 0.10
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Perceived Stress	31600	32040	Figure 2 shows there was a decrease in the perceived stress score from the first day of Training (Time 1) to the last day of post-training (Time 2) of 36.15% in the MBPBS condition and 9.02% in the TAU condition. Differences across time and between conditions on PSS were examined with a 2 (condition: MBPBS vs. TAU) Ã— 2 (timepoint: pre vs. post) mixed model ANOVA. The results revealed a significant interaction, F(1,73) = 73.70, p < 0.001
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Use of STAT medications per week after training	34374	34576	During the post-training phase, the use of stat medications in the MBPBS condition was significantly lower (M = 0.23, SD = 0.68) than in the TAU condition (M = 7.17, SD = 3.30), t(58) = 11.28, p < 0.001
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Physical restraint use per week during training 	33079	33315	During the Training phase, there was a statistically significant difference in physical restraint use per week across the MBPBS (M = 8.00, SD = 4.06) and TAU conditions (M = 13.60, SD = 2.72), t(18) = 3.62, p = 0.002 (Cohen's d = 1.62).
Caregiver Training in Mindfulness 	Usual Training 	Physical restraint use per week after training 	33316	33503	During the post-treatment phase, use of physical restraints was lower in the MBPBS condition (M = 0.53, SD = 0.90) than in the TAU condition (M = 10.77, SD = 3.21), t(58) = 1.73, p = 0.10
