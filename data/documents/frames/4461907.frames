Diabetes quality improvement intervention	Control	Statins prescribing rate 	1705	2094	One year post-implementation, in the early clinics, there were estimated relative increases in guideline-concordant prescribing of 37.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI); 29.0–46.2 %) among patients indicated for both ACE-inhibitors and statins and 38.7 % (95 % CI; 23.2–54.2 %) among patients indicated for statins. No such increases were seen in the late (control) clinics in that period.
