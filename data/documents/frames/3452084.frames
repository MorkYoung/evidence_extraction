naproxen sodium 550 mg (NAP)	placebo (PLA)	assessment of tolerability	-1	-1	PCF and NAP were significantly better than placebo (P < 0.05), whilst no differences emerged between the two active treatments.Fig. 1
paracetamol 1,000mg–caffeine 130mg (PCF) 	naproxen sodium 550 mg (NAP)	assessment of tolerability	16060	16350	The global assessment of tolerability expressed by the patient is shown in Table 4. The evaluation was 'excellent' or 'very good' in 45.7% of the patients after PCF, in 51.6% after NAP, and 41.7% after PLA. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) between NAP and PLA.Table 4
paracetamol 1,000mg–caffeine 130mg (PCF) and naproxen sodium 550 mg (NAP)	placebo (PLA)	Time course of total pain relief (TOTPAR)	-1	-1	The time course of TOTPAR during the 4-h observation period is shown in Fig. 2, whilst TOTPAR mean values with standard errors are displayed in Table 5. Both PCF and NAP provided significantly more relief than placebo (P < 0.05), but were not significantly different from each other.Fig. 2
paracetamol 1,000mg–caffeine 130mg (PCF) 	naproxen sodium 550 mg (NAP)	assessment of tolerability	13953	14756	Considering the PP population (n = 93), in which all the tolerability assessments were available, the following percentages of patients reported AEs in the 4-h post-dose period: 36.6% with PCF, 31.2% with NAP, and 36.6% with placebo (PLA). Comparing PCF and NAP, the proportion of discordant pairs (that is, patients who reported AEs with one but not the other drug and vice versa) were 19.4 and 14.0%, respectively, with a difference of 5.4% (90% CI, −4.4 to 15.2%). Comparing PCF and PLA, the proportion of discordant pairs was 14.0% for both treatments, with no differences of discordant pairs (90% CI, −9.0 to 9.0%). Since in the comparisons PCF–NAP and PCF–PLA the confidence interval included both Δ (the maximum tolerated difference between treatments) and zero, the difference was nonsignificant
paracetamol 1,000mg–caffeine 130mg (PCF) 	naproxen sodium 550 mg (NAP)	pain intensity difference (PID)	-1	-1	PID relative to baseline steadily increased over time in both the active treatments compared to placebo. PCF and NAP were significantly better than placebo (P < 0.05), whilst no differences emerged between the two active treatments
