Dalteparin	Vitamin K antagonist	≥1 adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism	1239	1460	Overall, fewer dalteparin-treated patients (2/74 [2.7 %]) experienced ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA-treated patients (15/88 [17.0 %]; hazard ratio = 0.15 [95 % confidence interval 0.03–0.65]; p = 0.01)
Dalteparin	Vitamin K antagonist	Mortality	19004	19116	The death rate in dalteparin-treated patients was 36/74 (48.6 %) and was 43/88 (48.9 %) in VKA-treated patients.
