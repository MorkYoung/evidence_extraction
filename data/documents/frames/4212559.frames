intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG)	usual care group (UCG)	fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c	13466	13544	There was no difference in changes of FPG and HbA1c levels between the groups.
intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG)	usual care group (UCG)	2 h plasma glucose and the glucose the area under the curve (AUC) - among participants with baseline HbA1c≥5.7%	13337	13454	2 h plasma glucose and the glucose AUC of ILG with HbA1c≥5.7% were significantly decreased compared with those of UCG
intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG)	usual care group (UCG)	2 h plasma glucose and the glucose the area under the curve (AUC) - among participants with baseline HbA1c≥5.7%	13331	13465	Also, 2 h plasma glucose and the glucose AUC of ILG with HbA1c≥5.7% were significantly decreased compared with those of UCG (table 2).
intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG)	usual care group (UCG)	cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among participants with baseline HbA1c levels ≥5.7%	11410	11771	The cumulative incidence of T2DM was significantly lower in the ILG than UCG among participants with baseline HbA1c levels ≥5.7% (log-rank=3.52, p=0.06; Breslow=4.05, p=0.04; Tarone-Ware=3.79, p=0.05), while this was not found among participants with baseline HbA1c levels <5.7% (log-rank=0.31, p=0.58; Breslow=0.56, p=0.46; Tarone-Ware=0.43, p=0.51; figure 2).
