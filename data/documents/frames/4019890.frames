1000 Î1⁄4g (arm C) of CEA peptide emulsified in Montanide and GM-CSF, given every 2 weeks until disease progression.	10 Î1⁄4g (arm A) of CEA peptide emulsified in Montanide and GM-CSF, given every 2 weeks until disease progression.	median and mean peak IFN-γ T cell response	1050	1313	Median and mean peak IFN-γ T cell response by ELISPOT (spots per 104 CD8+ cells, Arm A/B/C) was 11/52/271 (A vs. C, p = 0.028) for medians and 37/148/248 (A vs. C, p = 0.032) for means. T cell responses developed or increased in 20%/60%/100% of pts in Arms A/B/C.
