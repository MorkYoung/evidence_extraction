(PD) early-stage Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive or sensory impairment were investigated OFF medication	(HC) age-matched healthy control subjects	deactivation of the posterior regions of the default mode network	1555	1736	relatively reduced deactivation was found in Parkinson's disease patients in posterior regions of the default mode network, notably the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex.
(PD) early-stage Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive or sensory impairment were investigated OFF medication	(HC) age-matched healthy control subjects	correlation between target energy and visual analogue scale (VAS) values	22712	22827	The correlation between target energy and VAS values was not significantly different between PD and HC (p = 0.795).
(PD) early-stage Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive or sensory impairment were investigated OFF medication	(HC) age-matched healthy control subjects	correlation between target energy and skin conductance response (SCR) magnitudes	23854	23959	Electrodermal measurements did not result in significant group differences of standardized SCR magnitudes
