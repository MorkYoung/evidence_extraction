New law criteria (Concept)	Intuitive approach (ad hoc)	Agreement between Experts and Sponsors	24292	24467	Chance-corrected agreement between the Expert Group and Sponsors was low within the concept arm (kappa: 0.27; 95% CI = 0.06–0.50) and the ad hoc arm (0.34; 95% CI = 0.10–0.58)
Commercial sponsor	Academic sponsor	Agreement between Experts and Sponsors	24565	24769	Neither the type of sponsor, whether commercial or academic (p-value for interaction: 0.74), nor the type of intervention (p-value for interaction: 0.85) affected the degree of agreement between assessors
New law criteria (Concept)	Intuitive approach (ad hoc)	Agreement between Experts and Sponsors	1520	1822	Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm. Chance-corrected agreement was higher in the ad hoc (kappa: 0.34 (95% confidence interval = 0.10–0.58)) than in the concept arm (0.27 (0.06–0.50)), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.67).
