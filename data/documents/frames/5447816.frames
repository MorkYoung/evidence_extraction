simulator-learning	video-learning groups	suturing test completion time	923	1165	All participants then took a personality test, and their microsuture test scores and the time to complete the task were compared. The time to complete the task was significantly shorter in the simulator group than in the video-learning group.
simulator-learning	video-learning groups	Nagoya University Micro Suturing Assessment System (NUMSAS) scores	9822	10177	When we compared the NUMSAS scores of the simulator-learning and video-learning groups, we found that the median score in the video-learning group was 52.0 points (range = 25–59.5), while it was 54.0 points (range = 22.5–60.0) in the simulator-learning group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.11287, Table 2).
simulator-learning	video-learning groups	suturing test completion time	11088	11219	The simulator-learning group completed the suturing test in a significantly shorter time than the video-learning group (P = 0.001).
simulator-learning	video-learning groups	length score - Nagoya University Micro Suturing Assessment System (NUMSAS) scores	10309	10583	The median length score was 13.5 points (range = 7.0–15.0) in the video-learning group and 15.0 points (range = 3.5–15.0) in the simulator-learning group. The length score was significantly better in the simulator-learning group than in the video-learning group (P = 0.02673
high E scores	average E scores	suturing test completion time	11927	12105	Students with relatively high "E" scores completed the suturing test significantly faster than those with average E scores (estimated regression coefficient = −418.2, P = 0.0118)
simulator-learning	video-learning groups	length score - Nagoya University Micro Suturing Assessment System (NUMSAS) scores	10178	10594	We compared the NUMSAS component scores between the two groups and found that only the length scores were significantly different. The median length score was 13.5 points (range = 7.0–15.0) in the video-learning group and 15.0 points (range = 3.5–15.0) in the simulator-learning group. The length score was significantly better in the simulator-learning group than in the video-learning group (P = 0.02673, Table 2).
simulator-learning	video-learning groups	Nagoya University Micro Suturing Assessment System (NUMSAS) scores	9843	10166	NUMSAS scores of the simulator-learning and video-learning groups, we found that the median score in the video-learning group was 52.0 points (range = 25–59.5), while it was 54.0 points (range = 22.5–60.0) in the simulator-learning group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.11287
low A scores	average A scores	suturing test completion time	12107	12306	Students with low A scores completed the suturing test faster than students with average A scores (estimated regression coefficient = −290.9, P = 0.057), although this difference was not significant.
