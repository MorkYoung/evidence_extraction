T-HS/Ctr	PF group	Levels of insulin	21448	21605	Insulin levels in the T-HS/Ctr group were significantly decreased compared with the PF group at all the time points (p<0.05, at day 2; p<0.01, at day 4 or 6;
T-HS/Ctr	T-HS/SE, T-HS/EAA	Free IGF-1 concentrations at day 4 and day 6	19435	19690	free IGF-1 concentrations increased gradually, but most slowly in the T-HS/Ctr group, which remained statistically lower than the other EN-treated groups (vs T-HS/SE at day 4, p<0.05; vs T-HS/EAA at day 4, p<0.01; vs T-HS/SE or T-HS/EAA at day 6, p<0.01).
T-HS/EAA	T-HS/SE	Gastrocnemius masses on day 4 and 6	18728	18868	T-HS/EAA group exhibited a significant increase in gastrocnemius mass compared with the T-HS/SE group on days 4 and 6, respectively (p<0.01)
T-HS/Ctr	T-HS/SE, T-HS/EAA	Free IGF-1 concentrations at day 4 and day 6	19691	19985	In addition, lower free IGF-1 levels were measured in the T-HS/Ctr group than PF group at day 4 and it reached statistical difference by day 6 (p<0.01), indicating that the depressed IGF-1 expression was sustained 6 days following T-HS after eliminating the interference of reduced food intake.
T-HS/EAA	T-HS/SE	Gastrocnemius masses on day 4 and 6	18724	18869	the T-HS/EAA group exhibited a significant increase in gastrocnemius mass compared with the T-HS/SE group on days 4 and 6, respectively (p<0.01).
T-HS/SE and T-HS/EAA	T-HS/Ctr	Gastrocnemius masses after 2 days	18511	18710	Gastrocnemius masses in the T-HS/SE and T-HS/EAA groups were significantly higher than the T-HS/Ctr group by 2 days post-T-HS (p<0.01), and this trend continued throughout the remainder of the study.
T-HS/EAA	T-HS/Ctr and T-HS/SE 	S6K1 phosphorylation	23973	24257	After EN treatment, S6K1 phosphorylation increased in both groups, but only with statistical significance observed in the T-HS/EAA group compared with the T-HS/Ctr group (p<0.01). Furthermore, phospho-S6K1 levels in the T-HS/EAA group were also higher than the T-HS/SE group (p<0.05).
T-HS/Ctr	PF group	Levels of insulin	21448	21618	Insulin levels in the T-HS/Ctr group were significantly decreased compared with the PF group at all the time points (p<0.05, at day 2; p<0.01, at day 4 or 6;  <NEWLINE>Figure 6A <NEWLINE>)
