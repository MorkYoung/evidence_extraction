Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean VAS pain score	1037	1204	Also, the mean VAS pain severity score was significantly lower in locking plate group compared with nonlocking plate group (4.45 ± 2.50 versus 6.00 ± 2.59, P = 0.046).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Follow-up duration	7603	7773	No difference was observed in the duration of follow-up between the locking plate and nonlocking plate groups (10.61 ± 3.05 months versus 12.95 ± 2.63 months, P = 0.158).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean functional score at follow-up	11152	11323	the mean of functional score was also higher in the locking plate group than in the nonlocking plate group at the follow-up (77.26 ± 9.95 versus 69.55 ± 10.22, P = 0.026).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Severity of the tibial plateau fractures	9152	9360	No significant differences were found between the two groups in the severity of the tibial plateau fractures according to the Schatzker (P = 0.556) or AO (P = 0.257) classifications systems (Figures 2 and 3).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean functional score at follow-up	863	1036	The mean of knee scores was significantly higher in locking plate group than in nonlocking plate group at the follow-up time (80.20 ± 10.21 versus 72.52 ± 14.75, P = 0.039).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean knee scores at follow-up	10800	10997	The mean of knee scores was significantly higher in the locking plate group as compared with the nonlocking plate group at the most recent follow-up (80.20 ± 10.21 versus 72.52 ± 14.75, P = 0.039).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean VAS pain score	11472	11632	The mean VAS pain score was significantly lower in the locking plate group compared with the nonlocking plate group (4.45 ± 2.50 versus 6.00 ± 2.59, P = 0.046).
Locking plate fixation	Nonlocking plate fixation	Mean knee scores at follow-up	863	1036	The mean of knee scores was significantly higher in locking plate group than in nonlocking plate group at the follow-up time (80.20 ± 10.21 versus 72.52 ± 14.75, P = 0.039).
