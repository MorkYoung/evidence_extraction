breast shielding	baseline	right breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral)	796	1222	On average, breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral) was found reduced by approximately 80% (p < 0,001) when shielding with 0.5 mm lead equivalent was used (from 0.45±0.25 mGy to 0.09±0.07 mGy on the right and from 0.26±0.14 mGy to 0.06±0.04 mGy on the left breast). No correlation between the body mass index (BMI) and the breast surface radiation dose was observed.
breast shielding	without breast shielding	breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging	11874	12097	The results for both groups were analysed using two-sided t-test and statistically significant differences between the doses to the shielded and unshielded breast were confirmed with a significance of p < 0.05 (Figure 3, 4)
breast shielding	baseline	left breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral)	796	1120	On average, breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral) was found reduced by approximately 80% (p < 0,001) when shielding with 0.5 mm lead equivalent was used (from 0.45±0.25 mGy to 0.09±0.07 mGy on the right and from 0.26±0.14 mGy to 0.06±0.04 mGy on the left breast)
breast shielding	baseline	left breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral)	12345	12564	The average dose value for the left breast decreased from 0.26±0.14 mGy to 0.06±0.04 mGy by using lead shield. The statistically significant decrease was confirmed by two-sided t-test of independent samples (p < 0.001).
breast shielding	baseline	right breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral)	12100	12344	As a consequence of the lead shielding, the average dose for the right breast decreased from 0.45±0.25 mGy to 0.09±0.07 mGy, representing a statistically significant decrease confirmed by the two-sided t-test of independent samples (p < 0.001).
breast shielding	without breast shielding	breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging	808	1120	breast exposure dose in lumbar spine imaging in both projections (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral) was found reduced by approximately 80% (p < 0,001) when shielding with 0.5 mm lead equivalent was used (from 0.45±0.25 mGy to 0.09±0.07 mGy on the right and from 0.26±0.14 mGy to 0.06±0.04 mGy on the left breast)
