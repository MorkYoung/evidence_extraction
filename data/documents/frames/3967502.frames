completed questions	control	the proportion of healthy items in total items chosen,	24501	24730	Consistent with a QBE, participants in the healthy eating intentions condition chose a greater proportion of healthy food (M = .38, SD = .42) relative to participants in the control conditions (M = .24, SD = .36) (see Figure 1).1
