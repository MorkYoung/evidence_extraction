Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856	placebo	Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score	19691	20027	There was a statistically significant increase in the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score between W0 and W8 in the Active group (2.41 ± 0.817 a.u. vs 3.13 ± 1.197 a.u., P < 0.0001, diff[95%CI] = 0.752 [0.391;1.114]) and in the Placebo group (2.24 ± 0.714 a.u. vs 2.58 ± 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0266, diff[95%CI] = 0.402 [0.032;0.771]) (Figure 3).
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856	placebo	stool consistency	2078	2316	At the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the Active group of the ITT population was significantly improved and classified as "normal" compared to Placebo (respectively 3.13 ± 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 ± 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0003).
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856	placebo	Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score	19691	19867	There was a statistically significant increase in the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score between W0 and W8 in the Active group (2.41 ± 0.817 a.u. vs 3.13 ± 1.197 a.u., P < 0.0001,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) CNCM I-3856	placebo	lower abdominal pain/discomfort scores at week 8	17381	17621	At W8, lower abdominal pain/discomfort scores were reported in the Active group compared to Placebo but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (Active group: 2.14 ± 1.292 a.u., Placebo group: 2.31 ± 1.355 a.u., P = 0.1052).
