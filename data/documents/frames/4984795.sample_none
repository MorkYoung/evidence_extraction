0	32	placebo	bevacizumab	progression - free survival ( PFS )	Addition of bevacizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo (median, 6.7 vs 5.3 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.80; P=0.0037) and increased overall response rate (46.0% vs 37.4% P=0.0315).
1	32	placebo	bevacizumab	overall response rate	Addition of bevacizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo (median, 6.7 vs 5.3 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.80; P=0.0037) and increased overall response rate (46.0% vs 37.4% P=0.0315).
2	41	ramucirumab	placebo	Median OS	Median OS was increased from 3.8 to 5.2 months in the ramucirumab arm compared with the placebo group; HR 0.776; 95% CI 0.603–0.998; P=0.047.
3	112	chemotherapy	bevacizumab	plasma Ang - 2 levels	In the presence of liver metastasis, bevacizumab treatment was associated with a marked decrease in plasma Ang-2 levels at progression while in the chemotherapy-treated group there was a trend towards increased plasma Ang-2 levels at progression (Supplementary Table S2).
4	145	chemotherapy	bevacizumab -	Ang - 2 levels	In the bevacizumab-treated group, however, Ang-2 levels were decreased at progression, compared with the chemotherapy only group (2217.0 vs 2891.0 pg ml−1).
