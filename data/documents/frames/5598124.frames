1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	mean arterial pressure (MAP)	924	1055	In the lidocaine group, compared with the placebo group, mean SBP, DBP, and MAP significantly reduced after cannulation (P < 0.05).
1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	mean use of nitroglycerin (TNG)	9270	9396	mean use of TNG was similar in the two groups and showed insignificant differences in the period after cannulation (P = 0.527)
1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	mean HR during follow-up period	1054	1158	. During the follow-up period, mean HR (P = 0.649) and TNG usage (P = 0.527) were similar in two groups.
1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	mean HR during follow-up period	9013	9124	mean HR during follow-up period was similar in the two groups, and the difference was insignificant (P = 0.649)
1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	systolic blood pressure (SBP)	924	1055	In the lidocaine group, compared with the placebo group, mean SBP, DBP, and MAP significantly reduced after cannulation (P < 0.05).
1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine for 90 s before cannulation	normal saline	mean use of nitroglycerin (TNG)	1085	1158	mean HR (P = 0.649) and TNG usage (P = 0.527) were similar in two groups.
