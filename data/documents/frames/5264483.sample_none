0	14	LU + B420	Placebo	body fat mass	For relative change in body fat mass, LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35).
1	35	LU + B420	Placebo	body fat mass	For relative change in body fat mass, LU + B420 showed a − 4.5% (− 1.4 kg, P = 0.02, N = 37) difference to the Placebo group, whereas LU (+ 0.3%, P = 1.00, N = 35) and B420 (− 3.0%, P = 0.28, N = 24) alone had no effect (overall ANOVA P = 0.095, Placebo N = 35).
2	182	LU + B420	Placebo	energy intake	B420 and LU + B420 reduced energy intake by approximately 300 kcal/day and 210 kcal/day compared to Placebo (Table 2).
3	200	LU + B420	Placebo	LPS level in plasma	LU + B420 appeared to increase LPS level in plasma compared to Placebo (Kruskal-Wallis P = 0.009), although the changes were small and LPS level remained below or close to the detection limit in most participants.
4	200	LU + B420	Placebo	LPS level	LU + B420 appeared to increase LPS level in plasma compared to Placebo (Kruskal-Wallis P = 0.009), although the changes were small and LPS level remained below or close to the detection limit in most participants.
5	216	LU + B420	Placebo	total body fat mass	In the current study, only the LU + B420 group significantly reduced total body fat mass compared to Placebo in the PP population, while there were no differences in the ITT population.
