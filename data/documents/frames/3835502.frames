Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Major adverse cardiac events rates	1100	1180	MACE rates were significantly different; 5.6% in PES and 2.5% in EES (P = 0.027)
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Myocardial infarction 	1180	1360	. Rates of MI (0.8% in PES vs 0.2% in EES, P = 0.308), all deaths (1.5% in PES vs 1.2% in EES, P = 0.739) and stent thrombosis (0.3% in PES vs 0.7% in EES, P = 0.325) were similar.
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Mortality 	1182	1360	Rates of MI (0.8% in PES vs 0.2% in EES, P = 0.308), all deaths (1.5% in PES vs 1.2% in EES, P = 0.739) and stent thrombosis (0.3% in PES vs 0.7% in EES, P = 0.325) were similar.
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Major adverse cardiac events rates	1100	1181	MACE rates were significantly different; 5.6% in PES and 2.5% in EES (P = 0.027).
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Myocardial infarction 	1182	1360	Rates of MI (0.8% in PES vs 0.2% in EES, P = 0.308), all deaths (1.5% in PES vs 1.2% in EES, P = 0.739) and stent thrombosis (0.3% in PES vs 0.7% in EES, P = 0.325) were similar.
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Ischemic-driven TVR at 2 years 	1361	1471	The clinical outcomes of EES are superior to PES, mainly due to a reduction in the rate of ischemia-driven TVR
Everolimus-eluting stent 	Paclitaxel-eluting stent	Target lesion revascularization	9254	9335	TLR rates were higher in the PES than in the EES group (3.5% vs 1.2%, P = 0.037).
