Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF), MI training (MI-AU)	baseline	Motivational Interviewing (MI) knowledge	22947	23233	It was administered at baseline and post-training, and results indicate a significant increase in MI knowledge (b = 0.111, SE = 0.015, t = 7.146, p < 0.001) for all participants with no significant differences between training conditions (b = −0.041, SE = 0.031, t = −1.328, p = 0.186).
Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF)	baseline	"sustain talk� (ST)	24651	24837	However, ST was significantly lower for clients of participants trained in the MI-LEAF condition (b = −0.1008, SE = 0.0179, 95% CI [0.873, 0.937), T = −5.629, p < 0.001) as hypothesized.
Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF), MI training (MI-AU)	baseline	Motivational Interviewing (MI) knowledge	22857	23233	The MI Knowledge Test was used as the outcome measure to estimate the impact of training. It was administered at baseline and post-training, and results indicate a significant increase in MI knowledge (b = 0.111, SE = 0.015, t = 7.146, p < 0.001) for all participants with no significant differences between training conditions (b = −0.041, SE = 0.031, t = −1.328, p = 0.186).

Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF)	MI training (MI-AU)	Frequency of client "change talk� (CT)	24933	25092	Frequency of client CT did not differ significantly between the training groups, (b = −0.018, SE = 0.064, p = 0.781, CI [−0.0145, 0.110], T = −0.279, p = 0.781
Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF)	MI training (MI-AU)	Motivational Interviewing (MI) knowledge	11875	12022	Participants were randomly assigned to one of two training conditions: MI As Usual (MI AU) or MI with Language Enhanced Attention and Focus (LEAF).
Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF)	MI training (MI-AU)	reflections of sustain talk	24049	24270	there was a significant difference such that participants in the LEAF-MI group gave fewer reflections of sustain talk than those in the MI-AU training (b = −0.257, SE = 0.114, p = 0.025, CI [−0.032 to 0.481], d = −0.369).
Language Enhanced Attention and Focus MI training condition (MI-LEAF)	baseline	"sustain talk� (ST)	27865	28034	Providers who received such training had less sustain talk in their follow up work samples (with actual clients) than those who did not receive the specialized training.
