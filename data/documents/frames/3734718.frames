Polyherbal formulation	No treatment	Viral load	-1	-1	In contrast, the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics (14.3 cells/Î1⁄4l/year, P=0.021) and insignificant reduction in the viral load.
Highly active antiretroviral treatment	No treatment	Viral load	978	1183	The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count (154.4 cells/μl/year, P<0.001) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months (-0.431+ 0.004 log10 IU/month, P<0.001).
Polyherbal formulation	Highly active antiretroviral treatment	CD4 reduction	25149	25425	The slow kinetics of the CD4 cell reduction in the PHF arm, 14.3 ± 6.1 cells/μl lost per year (R2 = 0.029, P=0.021), contrasted that of the HAART and the difference between the two arms was statistically significant at all the time points (P<0.001) subsequent to the baseline.
Highly active antiretroviral treatment	No treatment	Viral load	-1	-1	The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count (154.4 cells/Î1⁄4l/year, P<0.001) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months (-0.431+ 0.004 log10 IU/month, P<0.001).
