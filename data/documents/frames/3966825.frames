Social media	Control	Recruitment for RCT	22351	22578	Prior to the intervention of social media, the mean was 0.41, whereas after the intervention with social media, this mean shifted statistically significantly to 6.69 (p<0.0001), as obtained through Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Social media	Control	Recruitment for RCT	18293	18941	In Phase 2 of the study, ongoing recruitment from traditional sources was supplemented with active recruitment from social media-based sources. During these 6 months implementing recruitment through social media (December 2011–May 2012), 45 women were recruited, for a 12-fold higher rate of ±7.5 recruits per month (p<0.0001) (Figure 3 and 4). Despite the fact that traditional healthcare-based recruitment outlets were expanded, social media generated about 78% of the recruitment during this phase. Amongst these sources, local online classifieds such as Kijiji and Craigslist had the greatest contribution of 58% of total recruitment (Table 1).
