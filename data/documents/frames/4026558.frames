Whole-body vibration	Control	Blood pressure	12472	12701	After the 3 month trial, the WBV and CON groups had no significant intragroup or intergroup differences in bilateral systolic pressure, bilateral diastolic pressure, bilateral mean artery pressure, or resting heat rate (Table 2).
Whole-body vibration	Control	Heart rate	1068	1165	After 3 months, there were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in both groups.
Whole-body vibration	Control	Brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (left side)	1166	1347	However, the bilateral baPWV was significantly reduced in the WBV group (decreased by 0.65 m/second [P=0.014]; 0.63 m/second [P=0.041] in either side), but not in the control group.
Whole-body vibration	Control	Brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (right side)	12724	12962	the bilateral baPWV of the WBV group and the CON group after 3 months were 1,462.3±204.2, 1,452.2±180.4 (compared with the pretest, P=0.014 and P=0.041), and 1,615.9±399.1 and 1,616.6±388.9 (compared with the pretest, P=0.958 and P=0.504)
Whole-body vibration	Control	Blood pressure	1068	1165	After 3 months, there were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in both groups.
Whole-body vibration	Control	Heart rate	1068	1164	After 3 months, there were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in both groups
Whole-body vibration	Control	Brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (right side)	12978	13257	There was a significant decrease in bilateral baPWV of the WBV group, although there was no obvious change in that of the CON group. However, the difference of posttest and pretest between the two groups did not reach statistical significance in either side (P=0.164 and P=0.382)
