alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	The percentage changes in lumbar BMD	10728	10970	The percentage changes in lumbar BMD from baseline to the end of one year of therapy were −0.4±4.0% for the AC group and 6.8±6.3% for the AD group, with significantly effective lumbar BMD findings identified in the AD group (P=0.015; Fig. 1).
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	FSSG score	1583	1782	Subsequent to one year of treatment, the FSSG score did not change from the baseline values for either study group, and no new bone fractures or esophagitis were observed in either group of patients.
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	FSSG score	12407	12590	The change from baseline FSSG scores to the end of one year of treatment was not significantly different in either group (AC group, P=0.556; AD group, P=0.723), respectively (Fig. 4).
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	The percentage changes in lumbar BMD	1352	1496	The percentage change in lumbar BMD from baseline to the end of treatment was −0.4±4.0% for the AC group vs. 6.8±6.3% for the AD group (P=0.015)
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	FSSG score	12193	12590	The mean baseline values for FSSG were 3.6±3.0 for the AC group vs. 9.4±7.2 for the AD group (P=0.056). After one year of treatment, the mean FSSG values were 4.5±2.8 for the AC group and 8.3±5.1 for the AD group. The change from baseline FSSG scores to the end of one year of treatment was not significantly different in either group (AC group, P=0.556; AD group, P=0.723), respectively (Fig. 4).
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	BAP (U/l),NTX (nmol BCE/l)	11398	11793	When comparing the percentage change between baseline and the end of one year of treatment, the AC group demonstrated less of a change over time in BAP (−12.1±25.5%) compared with the AD group (−32.7±21.7%) (P=0.103), and less of a change over time in NTX (+2.4±25.7%) compared with the AD group (−15.9±21.3%) (P=0.143); although the difference was not statistically significant (Figs. 2 and 3).
alendronate (AD) 	alfacalcidol (AC)	BAP (U/l),NTX (nmol BCE/l)	1498	1581	No significant percentage change of BAP and NTX between the two groups was observed
