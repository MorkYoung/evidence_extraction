three injections per week (TIW) growth hormone treatment (GHT)	daily GH treatment (GHT)	improvement in height	13210	13847	After 12 months of treatment, both groups of children showed a significant increase in height (−1.5 ± 0.40 versus −2.06 ± 0.43 SD and −1.5 ± 0.5 versus −2.04 ± 0.69 SD; both p < 0.001), growth velocity (2.7 ± 0.7 versus −3.4 ± 0.9 SD; p = 0.003 and 3 ± 1.4 versus −3.3 ± 0.9 SD; p < 0.001), and IGF-I levels (332 ± 125 versus 99.5 ± 23.8 μg/L and 352 ± 89.1 versus 100 ± 23.4 μg/L; both p < 0.001), with a concomitant lower, although not statistically significant, bone age delay (0.90 ± 0.05 versus 0.81 ± 0.12; p = 0.089 and 0.89 ± 0.11 versus 0.81 ± 0.09; p = 0.098), while no significant difference was found in BMI and WC (Table 1).
 three injections per week (TIW) (GHT), daily (GHT)	baseline	fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance (Homa-IR)	972	1140	As regards the metabolic parameters, in both groups, we found a significant increase in fasting insulin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.026) and Homa-IR (p < 0.001 and p = 0.019).
receive daily GH treatment (GHT)	baseline	insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and oral disposition index (DIo)	1141	1276	A significant increase in fasting glucose (p = 0.001) and a decrease in ISI (p < 0.001) and DIo (p = 0.002) were only found in group A.
