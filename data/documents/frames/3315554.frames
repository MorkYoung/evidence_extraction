Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC)	Renal function parameters	1735	1867	Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF-treated patients.
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Hip bone mass density at weeks 24 and 48	1263	1482	In TDF/FTC-treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 (−1.8% and −2.5%) and week 48 (−2.1% and −2.1%), whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm.
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Hip bone mass density at weeks 24 and 48	20442	20628	We observed significant reductions from baseline in both hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 and 48 among TDF/FTC-treated patients, whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm.
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Lumbar spine bone mass density at weeks 24 and 48	1263	1482	In TDF/FTC-treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 (−1.8% and −2.5%) and week 48 (−2.1% and −2.1%), whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm.
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Bone turnover biomarkers (except osteoprotegerin)	1565	1675	All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF/FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Lumbar spine bone mass density at weeks 24 and 48	1263	1481	In TDF/FTC-treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 (−1.8% and −2.5%) and week 48 (−2.1% and −2.1%), whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)	Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) 	Bone turnover biomarkers (except osteoprotegerin)	1565	1734	All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF/FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm, but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD.
