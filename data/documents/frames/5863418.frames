preadjusted edgewise appliance (PEA)	without orthodontic treatment	TNF-α levels after 168 h	1226	1318	TNF-α levels were significantly decreased at 168 h after force application in the PEA group.
preadjusted edgewise appliance (PEA) and self-ligating (SL) systems	without orthodontic treatment	The mean TNF-α value at 24 h 	1088	1225	The concentration of TNF-α was significantly higher in the experimental groups than in the control group at 24 h after force application.
preadjusted edgewise appliance (PEA) and self-ligating (SL) systems	without orthodontic treatment	The mean TNF-α value at 24 h 	12463	12893	There was a statistically significant difference in TNF-α concentration at 24 h after orthodontic force application in the PEA group as compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, significant differences were observed at 24 h and 168 h after orthodontic force application in the SL system as compared to baseline (P < 0.05). The mean TNF-α value was significantly elevated at 24 h after force application in the PEA and SL groups.
preadjusted edgewise appliance (PEA)	without orthodontic treatment	TNF-α levels after 168 h	13097	13248	Table 2 compares two adjacent concentrations of TNF-α, which were significantly decreased after 168 h of force application in the PEA group (P < 0.05).
