Astaxanthin-rich Haematococcus pluvialis	Control	Delayed recall improvement	12776	13014	Table 3 shows the mean response time of all 5 CogHealth tasks and the mean accuracy of 2 tasks—'working memory' and 'delayed recall'—at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of Ax-Hp administration. The 3 groups did not significantly differ.
Astaxanthin-rich Haematococcus pluvialis	Control	Choice reaction improvement 	13024	13308	the changes in response time were as follows: in the high-dosage group, improvement trends were observed for 'choice reaction' (451.1 ± 56.7 vs 480.1 ± 77.5), 'delayed recall' (818.3 ± 195.9 vs 880.1 ± 189.4), and 'divided attention' (385.3 ± 72.5 vs 419.4 ± 79.6), each p values <0.1
