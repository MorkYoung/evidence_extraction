(A group) graft of right internal mammary artery to the anterior interventricular branch	(B group) graft of left internal mammary artery to the same branch	assessment of functional class - NYHA class	-1	-1	In the assessment of functional class. no patient in group A (0%) were in NYHA class I. 15 (60%) in class II. seven (28%) in class III. and three (12%) in class IV . In group B. three (12%) were in class I. 14 (56%) in class II. seven (28%) in class III and one (4%) in class IV. There was no statistical difference (P=0.258) between the two groups.
(A group) graft of right internal mammary artery to the anterior interventricular branch	(B group) graft of left internal mammary artery to the same branch	evaluation of coronary flow	13840	14129	The central point of this study is the evaluation of coronary flow. The evaluation of <NEWLINE>the measured flow through the transit time showed an average flow of 42.2 ± 23.4 ml/min <NEWLINE>in Group A and 34.2 ± 19.1 ml/min in group B. featuring a statistically significant <NEWLINE>difference in favor of group A.
(A group) graft of right internal mammary artery to the anterior interventricular branch	(B group) graft of left internal mammary artery to the same branch	the pulsatility index (PI)	14753	14812	In group A. the mean PI was <NEWLINE>2.8±0.9 and in group B 2.0±0.7.

(A group) graft of right internal mammary artery to the anterior interventricular branch	(B group) graft of left internal mammary artery to the same branch	the pulsatility index (PI)	14619	14865	The device manufacturer provides measurement values for flow traffic time <NEWLINE>of less than 5 as indicative of a good quality anastomosis. In group A. the mean PI was <NEWLINE>2.8±0.9 and in group B 2.0±0.7. Table 5 shows <NEWLINE>the results obtained from both groups.
