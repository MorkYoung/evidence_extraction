group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	age group of the patients	11904	12116	The mean age in ILMA group was 32.23 years. The mean age in DLS group was 34.3 years. By applying independent samples test, the "P" value was found to be >0.05 and hence the two groups were comparable by mean age
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	age group of the patients	11844	12116	The age group of the patients in the study was 18–60 years. The mean age in ILMA group was 32.23 years. The mean age in DLS group was 34.3 years. By applying independent samples test, the "P" value was found to be >0.05 and hence the two groups were comparable by mean age
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	success rate of intubation	1217	1313	The success rate of intubation through Intubating Laryngeal Mask is comparable with that of DLS.
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	success rate of intubation	14301	14423	The overall success rate was 100% in both the groups, that is, all the patients were intubated in both ILMA and DLS groups
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	attenuation of hemodynamic responses	14683	14877	Analysis of baseline hemodynamic parameters like SBP – 0, DBP – 0, MBP – 0 and HR – 0 was done. These baseline hemodynamic variables were found to be comparable between the two groups [Table 8].
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	upper airway morbidity	1314	1402	The upper airway morbidity and mean oxygen saturation are comparable in both the groups.
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	attenuation of hemodynamic responses	1118	1216	ILMA offers no advantage in attenuating the hemodynamic responses compared to direct laryngoscope.
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	mean oxygen saturation	1314	1402	The upper airway morbidity and mean oxygen saturation are comparable in both the groups.
group ILMA, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway	group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy	mean oxygen saturation	16918	17012	There was no statistical significance between the two groups with respect to oxygen saturation
