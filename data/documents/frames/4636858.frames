Mitoxantrone + methylprednisolone	Mitoxantrone only	Multiple sclerosis plaques	1285	1414	MRI plaques number reduced in groups significantly (2.29 vs. 2.17) without significant difference between the groups (P = 0.782).
Mitoxantrone + methylprednisolone	Mitoxantrone only	Expanded disability status scale	1546	1710	The mean value of EDSS showed significant reduction at the end of treatment in groups (0.79 and 0.53) without significant difference between the groups (P = 0.953).
Mitoxantrone + methylprednisolone	No treatment	Multiple sclerosis plaques 	1285	1544	MRI plaques number reduced in groups significantly (2.29 vs. 2.17) without significant difference between the groups (P = 0.782). Six months after trial completion, plaques number increased in groups without significantly difference (0.72 vs. 0.77, P = 0.611)
