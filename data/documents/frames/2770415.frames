shared decision-making intervention (SDMI) for substance-dependent patients	usual treatment for substance-dependent patients	Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ)	21762	22136	A significant difference between SDMI and control condition was measured on the HAQ completed by clinicians. Helpfulness (t = 2.44, p < 0.05 and t = 2.82, p < 0.01 respectively at interim and exit measurement) and total score (t = 2.01, p < 0.05 and t = 3.01, p < 0.01 respectively at interim and exit measurement) were significantly higher when clinicians carried out SDMI.
