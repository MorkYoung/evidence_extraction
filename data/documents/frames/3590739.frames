Healthy group	Periodontitis group	Whole blood total antioxidant capacity 	1159	1339	Results of the present study has shown that the total antioxidant capacity in whole blood in patients with periodontitis was significantly (P<0.005) lower than in control subjects.
Healthy group	Periodontitis group	Whole blood total antioxidant capacity 	869	1059	The study was conducted on 30 non-smoking volunteers with age ranging between 18-40 years. They were categorized into two groups; chronic periodontitis group and healthy group, respectively.
Healthy group	Periodontitis group	Whole blood total antioxidant capacity 	6396	6670	The student 't' test [Table 2 and Figure 1] was used for statistical analysis with 95% of confidence interval which showed that total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) was significantly decreased in blood of periodontitis group patients when compared with healthy group (P<0.001).
