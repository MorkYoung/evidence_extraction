intervention group (where mood, stress and daily activities were monitored with program mobiletype)	attention-comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored)	deciding about medication and referrals	27368	27539	mobiletype program was significantly more helpful in deciding about medication (p = .013, d = 0.55) and referrals (p = .012, d = 0.56) compared to the attention comparison
intervention group (where mood, stress and daily activities were monitored with program mobiletype)	attention-comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored)	post-test in the GP Confidence scale	27855	28197	The difference between groups at post-test in the GP Confidence scale (Cronbach's alpha [α] = 0.93) were tested by regression analysis, adjusting for pre-test GP Confidence scale score. After adjusting for baseline values, the difference between intervention and comparison group's doctors confidence was not significant (β = 1.05, p = .131).
