Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Symptom improvement 	1957	2130	Compared with the HA group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (p < 0.05).
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Treatment-related serious adverse events 	1779	1833	No cell-related serious adverse effects were observed.
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	SF-36 bodily pain score improvement 	1957	2130	Compared with the HA group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (p < 0.05).
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Tibial bone expansion	2131	2413	The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (p < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.02), and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss (0.7% vs –4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.10) than the HA controls.
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score improvement 	-1	-1	However, significant differences between treatment groups were observed for KOOS symptoms and pain at 18 months (both p = 0.03) and 24 months (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively), and for ADL at 18 months (p = 0.04), all in favour of patients who were injected with the MPC + HA preparation
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Treatment-related serious adverse events 	1779	1832	No cell-related serious adverse effects were observed
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Tibial cartilage volume loss	2131	2413	The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (p < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.02), and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss (0.7% vs –4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.10) than the HA controls.
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Activities of daily living	1957	2130	Compared with the HA group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (p < 0.05).
Allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells	Control	Tibial bone expansion	2135	2293	MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (p < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.02)
