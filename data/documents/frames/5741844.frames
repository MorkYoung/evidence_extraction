Group 2: XPF with 1 mL of 17% EDTA for one minute	negative control group	amount of the smear layer at coronal, middle and apical thirds of the root canals	1859	2074	The results of the study showed the least amount of the smear layer at coronal, middle and apical thirds of the root canals in groups 2, which was not significantly different from the negative control group (P<0.5).
Group 1, 2, 3, 4	Positive and Negative control groups	Root canal walls without any smear layer	10556	10638	Root canal walls without any smear layer were detected in none of the study groups
group 2: XPF with 1 mL of 17% EDTA for one minute	group 4: XP-endo Finisher file for 30 seconds in association with 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA for 30 seconds	amount of the smear layer remaining in the coronal third	1859	2074	The results of the study showed the least amount of the smear layer at coronal, middle and apical thirds of the root canals in groups 2, which was not significantly different from the negative control group (P<0.5).
group 4: XP-endo Finisher file for 30 seconds in association with 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA for 30 seconds	negative control group	amount of residual smear layer	12794	12867	no significant differences between group 4 and the negative control group
group 4: XP-endo Finisher file for 30 seconds in association with 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA for 30 seconds	negative control group	amount of residual smear layer	12409	12877	The amount of the smear layer remaining in the coronal third in group 4 was not significantly different from that in group 2, and the amount of the smear layer remaining in the middle and apical thirds was not significantly different from that in the negative control group (group 5). Irrespective of the cross-section, group 2 exhibited the least amount of residual smear layer, with no significant differences between group 4 and the negative control group (Fig. 2).
group 2: XPF with 1 mL of 17% EDTA for one minute	group 4: XP-endo Finisher file for 30 seconds in association with 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA for 30 seconds	amount of the smear layer remaining in the coronal third	12409	12533	The amount of the smear layer remaining in the coronal third in group 4 was not significantly different from that in group 2
