sitagliptin	pioglitazone	The titers of GADAb	-1	-1	The titers of GADAb were not significantly different between the S and P groups at any time point in the present study (Table S1).
sitagliptin	pioglitazone	BMI (or body weight), blood pressure and HbA1c	15614	15744	The values of BMI (or body weight), blood pressure and HbA1c did not significantly differ between the two groups during the study.
sitagliptin	pioglitazone	the ∑C-peptide values during the oral glucose tolerance test	1013	1244	On average, the ∑C-peptide values during the oral glucose tolerance test through the follow-up periods showed a nonsignificant increase in the S group (n = 6, n = 5 at 48 months) compared to the P group (n = 5, n = 2 at 48 months).
sitagliptin	pioglitazone	The titers of GADAb	1535	1926	Although the titers of GADAb were not significantly different between the S and P groups during the study, the change ratio of the GADAb titers from baseline was significantly inversely correlated with the change ratio of the ∑C-peptide values from baseline in the S group (p = 0.003); in particular, when the GADAb titers decreased from baseline, the ∑C-peptide values frequently increased.
