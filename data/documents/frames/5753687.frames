umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) 1×106 UC-MSCs/kg, with one infusion per week	control	CD endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS) after Colonoscopy 	11529	11884	Colonoscopy showed that the CDEIS in the UC-MSC group was 9.2±1.5 and 3.4±1.2 before treatment and at the 12-month follow-up, respectively (Fig. 3). The values were 8.7±2.3 at the start of the study and 7.2±1.9 at the 12-month follow-up in the control group, which indicates significant differences in the two groups (p<0.01, UC-MSC vs control) (Fig. 2D).

In the control group, the CDAI, HBI, and corticosteroid dosage were 293.2±68.4, 11.9±3.5, and 12.8±2.5, respectively; 12 months after treatment, the CDAI, HBI, and corticosteroid dosage were 269.6±62.5, 10.7±3.3, and 11.6±2.4, respectively, representing respective decreases of 23.6±12.4, 1.2±0.58, and 1.2±0.35 mg/day (p<0.01, p<0.05, and p<0.05; UC-MSC vs control; respectively) (Fig. 2A–C).
