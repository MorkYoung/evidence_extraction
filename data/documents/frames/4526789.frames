involvement of significant others	no involvement of significant others	additional benefit in hearing rehabilitation	46189	46357	Within hearing rehabilitation there is growing evidence to suggest that the involvement of significant others offers additional benefit to individuals with hearing loss
after Computer-based auditory training (CBAT) intervention	before Computer-based auditory training (CBAT) intervention	intrinsic motivation	21096	22075	The majority of participants agreed that the CBAT intervention was both interesting and enjoyable, suggesting there was intrinsic motivation to undertake training. Most agreed or strongly agreed with the statements "The training program held my interest" (n = 35, 79.5%) and "I enjoyed training with the program" (n = 38, 86.4%), which is indicative of participants acting of their own free will (autonomy). There was little agreement shown for "I found my attention on the training program wandered during the session" (n = 7, 15.9%), suggesting that those participants were actively engaged with the CBAT. Finally, low agreement with the item "I found the training program difficult to use" (n = 1, 2.3%) and high agreement with "I understood what to do when using the training program" (n = 42, 95.5%) demonstrates competence in participants' ability to undertake CBAT. Only, three participants (6.8%) agreed with the statement "I would never use this training program again."
