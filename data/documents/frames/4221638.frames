Tranexamic acid	Placebo	Intracranial haemorrhage	15222	15444	Progressive intracranial haemorrhage was present in 21 (18%) of patients allocated to TXA and in 32 (27%) of patients allocated to placebo. The difference was not statistically significant [RR = 0.65 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.05)]
Tranexamic acid	Placebo	Risk of unfavorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Score	-1	-1	There were no significant difference in the risk of death from all causes in patients allocated to TXA compared with placebo [RR?=?0.69 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.39)] and the risk of unfavourable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale [RR?=?0.76 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.27)].
