AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge	unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge	AUC results in severity of throat soreness	19717	20149	The AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge produced significantly different AUC results for the change from baseline to 2 hours in severity of throat soreness compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (p = 0.001; Table 2). Similarly, the AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge also significantly reduced the severity of throat soreness versus the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge, as measured by AUC for the change from baseline to 2 hours (p < 0.0001).
AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge	unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge	improvements in swallowing	26627	26826	Both AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenges provided statistically significant improvements in swallowing compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (p = 0.018 and p = 0.011, respectively
AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge	unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge	improvements in swallowing	25158	25366	The AUC for change from baseline to 2 hours post dose in difficulty in swallowing showed significant differences with both AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge
AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge	unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge	changes from baseline in throat soreness between 1 and 20 minutes	21907	22183	Both AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenges produced significant changes from baseline in throat soreness between 5 and 120 minutes and 1 and 120 minutes post dose, respectively, compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (all p < 0.05, all p < 0.01, respectively;
AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge	unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge	improvements in swallowing	25158	25981	The AUC for change from baseline to 2 hours post dose in difficulty in swallowing showed significant differences with both AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (Table 3B). At 1 minute post dose, the AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge induced significantly different changes from baseline in difficulty in swallowing compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (p < 0.0001). A significant improvement in swallowing remained at each of the subsequent assessment timepoints between 5 and 120 minutes (all p < 0.01). The AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge induced significantly different changes from baseline in difficulty in swallowing compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge at each of the timepoints between 5 and 60 minutes and at 90 minutes post dose (all p < 0.05; Figure 4).
