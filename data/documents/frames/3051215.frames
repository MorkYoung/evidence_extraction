anti-inflammatory agent (Diacerein treatment group)	placebo	mean changes in body weight, BMI, and waist circumference	920	1229	The treatment group had a tendency towards more reduction in anthropometry as compared to the placebo group, in body weight reduction (- 7.0 kg vs. - 4.6 kg), body mass index (- 2.51 kg/m2 vs. - 1.59 kg/m2), and waist circumference (- 7.3 cm vs. - 4.4 cm). These reductions were not statistically significant.
anti-inflammatory agent (Diacerein treatment group)	placebo	hsCRP, and adiponectin	12505	12915	We also evaluated the changes in inflammatory markers between the two groups. Again, no statistical differences were apparent. Although there were no differences between the two groups, hsCRP, and adiponectin showed more favorable change in the treatment group than in the placebo group. Other inflammatory markers were not shown as expected, but TNF-α was decreased in both groups after intervention (Table 3)
anti-inflammatory agent (Diacerein treatment group)	placebo	hsCRP, and adiponectin	11406	11612	several inflammatory markers including white blood cell count, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen, TNF-α, and adiponectin level were also measured; no differences between the two groups were evident (Table 1).
