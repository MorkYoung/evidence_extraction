resistance training dyrung radiation therapy	passive physical therapy	pyridinoline	-1	-1	Mean change values of PYD and CTX-I were significantly lower at 3 months after RT (p�??=�??0.035 and p�??=�??0.043) in Arm A. Importantly, all markers decreased in both arms, except of PYD and CTX-I in arm B, although significance was not reached for some biomarkers.
