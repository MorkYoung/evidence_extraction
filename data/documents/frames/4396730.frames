Sulodexide composed of 80% fast-moving heparin and 20% dermatan sulfate	Placebo	LDL-C and blood pressure	8463	8692	Moreover, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1C, LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were comparable in both groups and did not change significantly throughout the study (Table 2).
Sulodexide composed of 80% fast-moving heparin and 20% dermatan sulfate	Placebo	Change in urine TGF-beta1	731	1033	Urinary TGF-beta1 increased significantly in the placebo group but did not change significantly in the sulodexide group. Additionally, the mean change of urine TGF-beta1 in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the sulodexide group (8.44 ± 9.21 versus 2.17 ± 6.96 pg/mg Cr, P = 0.02).
Sulodexide composed of 80% fast-moving heparin and 20% dermatan sulfate	Placebo	Routine hematologic and chemistry indices in blood	8350	8444	Routine blood chemistry and hematologic parameters did not significantly change in both groups
Sulodexide composed of 80% fast-moving heparin and 20% dermatan sulfate	Placebo	Body weight and glycemic parameters	8473	8692	body weight, fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1C, LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were comparable in both groups and did not change significantly throughout the study (Table 2).
Sulodexide composed of 80% fast-moving heparin and 20% dermatan sulfate	Placebo	Urine albumin	9292	9588	Urine albumin increased from baseline in the placebo group, by 15.05 ± 30.09 μg/mg Cr (P = 0.038), while no significant change was found in the sulodexide group, by 13.89 ± 32.25 μg/mg Cr (P = 0.069). However, the increase in urine albumin did not significantly differ in both groups (P = 0.970).
