Denosumab 	Control	Migration by secondary MTPM variables after 2 years	1628	1699	There was no significant difference in MTPM for the period 12–24 months
Denosumab 	Control	Knee osteoarthritis outcome score after 1 year	1701	1787	KOOS sub-variables were similiar between denosumab and placebo after 12 and 24 months.
Denosumab 	Control	Knee osteoarthritis outcome score after 2 years	12581	12718	KOOS sub-variables showed no statistically significant difference between denosumab and placebo postoperatively, or after 12 or 24 months
Denosumab 	Control	Knee osteoarthritis outcome score after 1 year	12581	12718	KOOS sub-variables showed no statistically significant difference between denosumab and placebo postoperatively, or after 12 or 24 months
Denosumab	Control	Migration by RSA maximal total point motion after 1 year	1178	1332	The primary effect variable, MTPM after 12 months, showed that migration in the denosumab group was statistically significantly less than in the controls.

Denosumab	Control	Migration by RSA maximal total point motion after 2 years	1178	1700	The primary effect variable, MTPM after 12 months, showed that migration in the denosumab group was statistically significantly less than in the controls. Denosumab MTPM 12 months was reduced by one-third (denosumab: median 0.24 mm, 10% and 90% percentiles: 0.15 and 0.41; placebo: median 0.36 mm, 10% and 90% percentiles: 0.20 and 0.62). The secondary MTPM variables (6 and 24 months) also showed a statistically significant reduction in migration. There was no significant difference in MTPM for the period 12–24 months.
