liposome bupivacaine 532 mg at day 8	bupivacaine HCl 150 mg group at day 8	mean satisfaction ratings, based on an 11-point NRS (0 = completely unsatisfied; 10 = completely satisfied)	17704	18193	Statistically significant differences in favor of liposome bupivacaine were also observed in study 3, where mean satisfaction ratings, based on an 11-point NRS (0 = completely unsatisfied; 10 = completely satisfied), were 9.2 in the liposome bupivacaine 532 mg group and 8.3 in the bupivacaine HCl 150 mg group (P = 0.045) at day 8, and in study 4 where mean ratings in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg and bupivacaine HCl 75 mg groups were 7.4 and 6.0, respectively (P = 0.03) at 96 hours.
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg	placebo	patient satisfaction scores	16533	16783	In the studies that included assessment of patient ratings of postsurgical analgesia (studies 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), the liposome bupivacaine group in study 9 showed statistically significantly better patient satisfaction scores than the comparator.
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg 	placebo	"satisfied� or "extremely satisfied� with their postoperative analgesia at 24 hours after surgery	16533	17011	In the studies that included assessment of patient ratings of postsurgical analgesia (studies 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), the liposome bupivacaine group in study 9 showed statistically significantly better patient satisfaction scores than the comparator. At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were "satisfied" or "extremely satisfied" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007).
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg 	placebo	"satisfied� or "extremely satisfied� with their postoperative analgesia at 24 hours after surgery	16784	17010	At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were "satisfied" or "extremely satisfied" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007)
liposome bupivacaine	bupivacaine HCl and placebo	The median time to first postsurgical use of rescue opioid medication	14645	14867	The median time to first postsurgical use of rescue opioid medication was significantly longer with liposome bupivacaine (9.3 hours) compared with bupivacaine HCl (6.4 hours; P = 0.013) and placebo (3.6 hours; P < 0.0001).
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg 	placebo	"satisfied� or "extremely satisfied� with their postoperative analgesia at 72 hours after surgery	17012	17095	At 72 hours after surgery, percentages were 95% and 73%, respectively (P = 0.0007).
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg 	placebo	"satisfied� or "extremely satisfied� with their postoperative analgesia at 72 hours after surgery	16784	17095	At 24 hours after surgery in this study, 95% of patients in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg group were "satisfied" or "extremely satisfied" with their postoperative analgesia compared with 72% in the placebo group (P = 0.0007). At 72 hours after surgery, percentages were 95% and 73%, respectively (P = 0.0007).
liposome bupivacaine 266 mg 	bupivacaine HCl 75 mg	mean satisfaction ratings, based on an 11-point NRS (0 = completely unsatisfied; 10 = completely satisfied) at 96 hours	17704	18193	Statistically significant differences in favor of liposome bupivacaine were also observed in study 3, where mean satisfaction ratings, based on an 11-point NRS (0 = completely unsatisfied; 10 = completely satisfied), were 9.2 in the liposome bupivacaine 532 mg group and 8.3 in the bupivacaine HCl 150 mg group (P = 0.045) at day 8, and in study 4 where mean ratings in the liposome bupivacaine 266 mg and bupivacaine HCl 75 mg groups were 7.4 and 6.0, respectively (P = 0.03) at 96 hours.
liposome bupivacaine	bupivacaine HCl	cumulative pain	14167	14360	Between-group differences were statistically significant in favor of liposome bupivacaine in six of these treatment arms through 24 hours and in five treatment arms through 72 hours (P < 0.05).
liposome bupivacaine	bupivacaine HCl	cumulative pain	918	1221	In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed, achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl (P < 0.05) in five of 17 treatment arms
