Women diagnosed with HF	Men diagnosed with HF	All-cause mortality rate	1123	1383	The primary outcome of this study was the absence of a large interaction between digoxin use and sex affecting mortality. For men, digoxin use was associated with a HR for mortality of 1.00, while for women, the HR was also 1.00 (p value for interaction 0.65).
Women diagnosed with HF	Men diagnosed with HF	All-cause mortality rate	1494	1631	Observational data do not support the concern that there is a substantial increased risk of mortality due to the use of digoxin in women.
Women diagnosed with HF	Men diagnosed with HF	All-cause mortality rate	788	1020	The study cohort consisted of 17 707 men and 19 227 women with the diagnosis of HF who contributed only time without digoxin exposure and 9487 men and 10 808 women with the diagnosis of HF who contributed time with digoxin exposure.
Women diagnosed with HF	Men diagnosed with HF	Digoxin dose	16745	16862	Digoxin dose was consistently lower in women than in men (mean daily dose 136 μg in women and 159 μg in men, p<0.001)
