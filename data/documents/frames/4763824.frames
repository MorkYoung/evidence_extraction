Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Mean visual analogue scale score for pain intensity after the injection	1108	1261	The mean VAS score was significantly lower in the ISWI group <NEWLINE>than in the control group at 10, 45, and 90 min, and 1 day after injection <NEWLINE>(P<0.05, t-test).
Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Patient-Specific Functional Scale score at baseline	14243	14353	There <NEWLINE>was no significant difference in the PSFS score and the number of injection sites <NEWLINE>between the two groups
Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Mean pain intensity score at baseline	13974	14141	At baseline, the mean rating of <NEWLINE>pain intensity score was 6.7 for the experimental group and 6.6 for the control <NEWLINE>group, with no difference between the groups (P=0.919).
Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Baseline characteristics	13845	13973	No significant differences in age, BMI, sex, regular physical exercise, and <NEWLINE>marital status were observed between the two groups.
Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Patient-Specific Functional Scale score 24 hours after injection	-1	-1	The PSFS score 1 day after treatment in the experimental group (6.2±1.8) was significantly higher compared with that in the control group (3.8±2.0; P<0.001). The mean increment in PSFS score on a 0 to 10 scale in the experimental group was 2.9±2.2 1 day after treatment, while the mean increment in the control group was 0.9±2.2. The mean difference in increment of the PSFS score between the two groups was 2.0 points in favor of the experimental group (95% confidence interval: 1.0-3.2; P<0.001).
Intracutaneous sterile water injection	Intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo)	Patient-Specific Functional Scale score 24 hours after injection	15748	15905	The PSFS score 1 day after treatment in the <NEWLINE>experimental group (6.2±1.8) was significantly higher compared with that in the <NEWLINE>control group (3.8±2.0; P<0.001).
