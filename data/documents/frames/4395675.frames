Gait training with constrained induced movement therapy	Gait training alone	Dynamic balance improvement	-1	-1	. The experimental group showed an improvement of 28.6% in dynamic balance as determined by the TIS, and of 34.3% in movement distances of the paretic side as determined by the LOS, and the changes in dynamic balance were significantly larger in the experimental group than in the control group, which showed no significant improvements in balance ability after gait training.
