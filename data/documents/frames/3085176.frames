1000 mg hesperidin with 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin and other groups	placebo	self-report ratings for the 10 symptoms	8995	9486	Table 3 depicts the results of the self-report ratings for the 10 symptoms. As compared to the placebo group, none of the changes in these 10 self-reported symptoms were statistically significant either 45 or 75 min. from baseline. No significant effects relative to the placebo group were observed by the participants in the four treatment groups for symptoms including anxiety, hunger, tension, sleepiness, energy, nervousness, headache, upset stomach, concentration or general discomfort.
p-synephrine (50 mg) alone	placebo	Resting metabolic rates (RMR)	816	932	The group receiving p-synephrine (50 mg) alone exhibited a 65 kcal increase in RMR as compared to the placebo group.
1000 mg hesperidin with 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin and other groups	placebo	self-report ratings for the 10 symptoms	1442	1673	None of the treatment groups exhibited changes in heart rate or blood pressure relative to the control group, nor there were no differences in self-reported ratings of 10 symptoms between the treatment groups and the control group.
100 mg hesperidin in addition to the 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin	placebo	Resting metabolic rates (RMR)	1062	1286	In the group receiving 100 mg hesperidin in addition to the 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin, the RMR increased by 183 kcal, an increase that was statistically significant with respect to the placebo control (p<0.02).
p-synephrine (50 mg) alone	placebo	Resting metabolic rates (RMR)	7245	7373	As compared to placebo, 50 mg p-synephrine (Advantra ZÂ®) alone (Group 2) more than doubled consumption by 65 kcals over placebo.
1000 mg hesperidin with 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin and other groups	placebo	heart rate and blood pressure 	1442	1673	None of the treatment groups exhibited changes in heart rate or blood pressure relative to the control group, nor there were no differences in self-reported ratings of 10 symptoms between the treatment groups and the control group.
600 mg naringin with 50 mg p-synephrine	placebo	Resting metabolic rates (RMR)	933	1061	The consumption of 600 mg naringin with 50 mg p-synephrine resulted in a 129 kcal increase in RMR relative to the placebo group.
