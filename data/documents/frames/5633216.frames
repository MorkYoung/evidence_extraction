Group I (CHX/thymol mouthwash-Vi-one)	Group II (CHX mouthwash-Behsa)	terms of bleeding index	13877	14061	Analysis of this data show that the mean BI in the Vi-one group decreased more than that in the Behsa group, but there were no significant differences between the two groups (p=0.879).
Group I (CHX/thymol mouthwash-Vi-one), Group II (CHX mouthwash-Behsa)	baseline	plaque index and gingival index	1293	1395	The results showed that plaque index and gingival index significantly reduced in two groups (p<0.001).
Group I (CHX/thymol mouthwash-Vi-one)	Group II (CHX mouthwash-Behsa)	terms of bleeding index	1493	1645	Similar results were observed in terms of bleeding index with the difference that the two groups did not differ significantly from each other (p=0.879).
Group I (CHX/thymol mouthwash-Vi-one)	Group II (CHX mouthwash-Behsa)	plaque index and gingival index	1293	1492	The results showed that plaque index and gingival index significantly reduced in two groups (p<0.001). However, group I was significantly more efficient than group II (p<0.001, p=0.021 respectively).
