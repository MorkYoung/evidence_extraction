N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline (Group A) and Ascorbic acid plus normal saline (Group B)	Only normal saline (Group C)	Glomerular filtration rate	1176	1360	The serum Cr increased and GFR decreased significantly during the intervention in three groups (P < 0.010). However, the amounts of these changes were equal between groups (P > 0.050).
N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline (Group A) and Ascorbic acid plus normal saline (Group B)	Only normal saline (Group C)	Age and sex of the patients at baseline	8398	8835	The chi-square test did not show any significant difference between the distribution of sex in the groups (P = 0.313). The overall age of patients was from 38 to 81 years with the mean of 67.6 ± 8.1 years. The mean age of patients in the Groups of A, B, and C was 67.5 ± 7.5, 67.8 ± 6.8 and 67.6 ± 8.1 years respectively. The ANOVA test did not show any significant difference between the age of patients in the three groups (P = 0.127).
N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline (Group A) and Ascorbic acid plus normal saline (Group B)	Only normal saline (Group C)	Contrast-induced nephropathy	9267	9401	This study showed that adding of NAC and AA have not any significant superior effect than traditionally used NS for preventing of CIN.
N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline (Group A) and Ascorbic acid plus normal saline (Group B)	Only normal saline (Group C)	Glomerular filtration rate	8938	9237	The amount of serum Cr (P = 0.661) and GFR (P = 0.785) were equal in the three groups of patients at the beginning of the study. The serum Cr increased, and GFR decreased significantly during the intervention in three groups (Table 1). However, the amounts of these changes were equal between groups
N-acetylcysteine plus normal saline (Group A) and Ascorbic acid plus normal saline (Group B)	Only normal saline (Group C)	Serum creatinine	1176	1360	The serum Cr increased and GFR decreased significantly during the intervention in three groups (P < 0.010). However, the amounts of these changes were equal between groups (P > 0.050).
