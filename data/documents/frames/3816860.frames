Linagliptin 	Control	Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio at 12 weeks	15791	16008	Notably, the magnitude of the albuminuria-lowering effect of linagliptin was already seen after 12 weeks of treatment (−29% [95% CI −40 to −17]; P < 0.05; between-group difference: −25% [95% CI −46 to +3]; P = 0.0750)
Linagliptin 	Control	Fasting plasma glucose 	17751	17991	Furthermore, significant results were seen in adjusted mean changes in FPG from baseline to week 24 (−8.88 mg/dL with linagliptin versus +16.22 mg/dL with placebo; between-group difference −25.1 mg/dL [95% CI −38.55 to −11.65]; P = 0.0003).
Linagliptin 	Control	Adverse events	19170	19318	The overall incidence of clinical AEs was similar between the linagliptin and placebo groups (63.0 vs. 63.6%, respectively) (Supplementary Table 2).
Linagliptin 	Control	Glycated hemoglobin	1235	1424	The between-group difference in the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 was −0.61% (−6.7 mmol/mol) in favor of linagliptin (95% CI −0.88 to −0.34% [−9.6 to −3.7 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001).
Linagliptin 	Control	Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio at 12 weeks	15800	16008	the magnitude of the albuminuria-lowering effect of linagliptin was already seen after 12 weeks of treatment (−29% [95% CI −40 to −17]; P < 0.05; between-group difference: −25% [95% CI −46 to +3]; P = 0.0750)
Linagliptin 	Control	Glycated hemoglobin	1235	1423	The between-group difference in the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 was −0.61% (−6.7 mmol/mol) in favor of linagliptin (95% CI −0.88 to −0.34% [−9.6 to −3.7 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001)
Linagliptin 	Control	Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio at 24 weeks	15507	15773	the percentage change in adjusted geometric mean UACR from baseline was significantly higher with linagliptin (−32% [95% CI −42 to −21]; P < 0.05) compared with placebo (−6% [95% CI −27 to +23]), with a between-group difference of −28% (95% CI −47 to −2; P = 0.0357)
Linagliptin 	Control	Adverse events	19170	19293	The overall incidence of clinical AEs was similar between the linagliptin and placebo groups (63.0 vs. 63.6%, respectively)
