6-month hypocaloric diet	baseline	body weight and BMI regain at follow-up	14244	14548	We calculated weight regain as the difference between body weight at follow-up and body weight after the active dietary intervention period at 6 months. After successful reduction of body weight and BMI with dietary intervention, we observed a significant weight regain at follow-up (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
6-month hypocaloric diet	baseline	intrahepatic lipids at follow-up	14658	14776	In contrast, intrahepatic lipids decreased during the dietary intervention but remained reduced at follow-up (Fig. 1).
