Gatorade and polyethylene glycol (PEG) without bisacodyl	NuLYTELY arm	Levels of blood electrolytes and BUN	1422	1618	Subjects in the combined G/PEG arms had a lower serum sodium (P<0.0007), chloride (P<0.007), and BUN (P<0.0001) levels than those in the NuLYTELY arm, but this did not cause any clinical symptoms.
Gatorade and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without bisacodyl	NuLYTELY arm	Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score	1037	1135	The BBPS scores in both the G/PEG arms and NuLYTELY arm were not significantly different (P=0.19).
Gatorade and polyethylene glycol (PEG) without bisacodyl	NuLYTELY arm	Gastrointestinal problems and discomfort	1136	1313	Compared with subjects in the NuLYTELY arm, subjects in the G/PEG without bisacodyl arm had less nausea (P<0.04), vomiting (P<0.02), abdominal pain (P<0.02), bloating (P<0.005),
Gatorade and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with bisacodyl	Gatorade and polyethylene glycol (PEG) without bisacodyl	Colon cleanliness	878	1036	Adding bisacodyl to G/PEG caused more abdominal bloating/cramps (P<0.01) and did not result in a cleaner colon (P=0.66) compared with G/PEG without bisacodyl.
