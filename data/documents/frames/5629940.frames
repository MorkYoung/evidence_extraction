ABP 501	Adalimumab	Adverse events	1664	1748	There were no clinically meaningful differences in AEs and laboratory abnormalities.
ABP 501	Adalimumab	ACR50 results	19801	20171	The percentages of patients who reached ACR50 response criteria at week 24 were 49.2% (120/244) and 52.0% (131/252) for the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups, respectively, with a RR (90% CI) for ABP 501 versus adalimumab of 0.948 (0.819, 1.097) and RD (90% CI) of −2.836% (−10.220%, 4.547%). The proportion of patients who achieved ACR50 was similar across treatment groups

ABP 501	Adalimumab	Disease Activity Score 28-joint count-C reactive protein	1598	1662	Changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP, ACR50 and ACR70 were similar
ABP 501	Adalimumab	ACR70 results	1598	1663	Changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP, ACR50 and ACR70 were similar.
ABP 501	Adalimumab	ACR20 results	1415	1597	ACR20 response at week 24 was 74.6% (ABP 501) and 72.4% (adalimumab). At week 24, the RR of ACR20 (90% CI) between groups was 1.039 (0.954, 1.133), confirming the primary hypothesis.
ABP 501	Adalimumab	ACR20 results	18920	19180	The RR (2-sided 90% CI) of ACR20 at week 24 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.039 (0.954, 1.133). The 90% CI of (0.954, 1.133) was well within the predefined equivalence margin (0.738, 1.355), demonstrating clinical equivalence between ABP 501 and adalimumab
