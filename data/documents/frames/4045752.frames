paracetamol for 6 hours after (therapeutic use) vaccination	The control group received no paracetamol.	The anti-HBs level 	-1	-1	The anti-HBs level in the therapeutic paracetamol group (4958 mIU/mL) was not significantly different from the control group.
paracetamol for 24 hours starting at the time of (prophylactic use) before vaccination	The control group received no paracetamol.	the anti-HBs level 	1274	1480	One month after the second booster vaccination, the anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was significantly lower (p = 0.048) than the level in the control group (4257 mIU/mL vs. 5768 mIU/mL)
paracetamol for 6 hours after (therapeutic use) vaccination	The control group received no paracetamol.	The anti-HBs level 	1482	1617	The anti-HBs level in the therapeutic paracetamol group (4958 mIU/mL) was not different (p = 0.34) from the level in the control group.
paracetamol for 24 hours starting at the time of (prophylactic use) before vaccination	The control group received no paracetamol.	the anti-HBs level 	17583	18073	Subsequently, we focused on comparison of the GMC of the different treatment groups. The anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was significantly lower (p = 0.048) than the level in the control group (Fig. 4, panel B) by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The reduction in anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was 26% as compared to the control group (4257 mIU/mL vs. 5768 mIU/mL) indicating that paracetamol decreases the induction of antibody response in adults.
