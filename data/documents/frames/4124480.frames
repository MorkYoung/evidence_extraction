12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	TDI focal score	-1	-1	Mean TDI focal score for the two groups after 12 weeks. Mean changes were a decrease of 0.2 for the control group and an increase of 5.1 for those completing the community-based exercise program (P < 0.001). Increased scores represent improvement in dyspnea where a change of 1.0 is considered clinically meaningful.
12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	total weight lifted	1231	1350	The CBE group increased muscle strength (weight lifted) by 11.8 kilograms per subject per week of training (P < 0.001).
12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	Mean SGRQ scores	1351	1386	SGRQ was not significantly changed.
12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	TDI focal score	17119	17279	TDI focal score, shown in Figure 5, increased by 5.1 in the CBE group versus a decrease of 0.2 in the control group, indicating less breathlessness (P < 0.001).
12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	total weight lifted	16436	16634	Patients who participated in the CBE arm lifted significantly more weight at the end of the exercise program compared with the beginning as shown in Figure 3: 3432 versus 1775 kilograms (P < 0.001).
12-weeks of progressive endurance and strength training at a local health club	continuation of unsupervised habitual physical activity	Mean treadmill endurance times	-1	-1	Mean treadmill endurance times for the two groups at baseline and after 12 weeks. Mean changes were a decrease of 59 seconds for the control group compared with an increase of 134 seconds for those completing the community-based exercise program (P?=?0.041).
