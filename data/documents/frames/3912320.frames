Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 500 Hz frequency	-1	-1	The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively.A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (p-values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t-test).
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 2,000 Hz frequency	9844	9998	The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively.
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 4,000 Hz frequency	-1	-1	The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively.A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (p-values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t-test).
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 500 Hz frequency	9726	9998	Figure 4 compares the mean correct responses between the control and test groups according to the stimulus frequency. The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively.
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 500 Hz frequency	10000	10205	A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (p-values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t-test).
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 2,000 Hz frequency	-1	-1	The control group obtained means that were 24%, 21% and 25% higher than those of the test group for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies, respectively.A comparison of the responses between the groups revealed that the number of correct responses was greater in the control group at all frequencies (p-values were less than 0.01 using the Student's t-test).
Occupational noise	Control	Correct response rate for 500 Hz frequency	9044	9291	Figure 2 presents the firefighters responses in relation to the frequencies used. Very similar values were observed, and the mean percentages of correct answer for the 500, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz frequencies were 31.9%, 30.4% and 28.07%, respectively.
