An evidence-based treatment program called SNAP (Stop Now and Plan)	baseline	Externalizing symptoms	24135	24315	Externalizing symptoms generally decreased for the whole sample across the three sessions as shown by a one-way within-subjects ANOVA, F(2,34) = 21.60, p < .001, partial η <NEWLINE>2 = .56.
An evidence-based treatment program called SNAP (Stop Now and Plan)	baseline	internalizing symptomatology	11139	11307	An evidence-based treatment program called SNAP (Stop Now and Plan; Augimeri, Walsh, Levene, Sewell, and Rajca, 2014) was delivered to children (CBT) and parents (PMT).
An evidence-based treatment program called SNAP (Stop Now and Plan)	baseline	internalizing symptomatology	24316	24420	A similar pattern could be seen for internalizing symptomatology, F(2,34) = 7.82, p = .002, partial η <NEWLINE>2.
long-term improvers (IMPs)	baseline	level of second theta power peak	27831	28102	For the second peak, a statistically significant session-by-group interaction effect was found, F(2,33) = 4.57, p = .018, partial η <NEWLINE>2 = .19, showing decreases in theta power for IMPs from pretreatment to follow-up (p = .001) and from posttreatment to follow-up (p = .01).
