Performance-based financing (PBF)	control 1 (C1; enhanced financing) group	administrators on average who left health centers	31053	31174	There were 0.10 (p < 0.05) fewer administrators on average who left health centers in the PBF group than in the C1 group.
Performance-based financing (PBF)	control 1 (C1; enhanced financing) group	compensation	24280	24481	For compensation, respondents in the C1 group reported an average of 8.64% (p < 0.05) lower between baseline and endline for being rewarded for their hard work than their counterparts in the PBF group.
control 1 (C1; enhanced financing) group	and control 2 (C2; pure control)	compensation	24280	24714	For compensation, respondents in the C1 group reported an average of 8.64% (p < 0.05) lower between baseline and endline for being rewarded for their hard work than their counterparts in the PBF group. Likewise, respondents in the C2 group reported 3.88% (p < 0.1) lower points between baseline and endline for compensation than those in the C1 group. There was not a statistically significant difference between the C1 and C2 groups.
Performance-based financing (PBF)	and control 2 (C2; pure control)	nurses on average who left health centers	31175	31323	The PBF intervention group also had lower turnover of nurses, with 0.14 (p < 0.05) fewer nurses on average who left when compared with the C2 group.

Performance-based financing (PBF)	and control 2 (C2; pure control)	job satisfaction	1073	1225	Econometric analysis shows that PBF led to increased job satisfaction and decreased attrition on a subset of measures, with little effect on motivation.
Performance-based financing (PBF)	and control 2 (C2; pure control)	job satisfaction	23575	23749	More specifically, we estimated a statistically significant increase of 4.75% (p < 0.05) in overall job satisfaction between baseline and endline for the PBF versus C2 group.
