quetiapine 300 mg/day	placebo	improvement of disorder	921	1246	Improvements in mean MADRS total scores from baseline to week 8 were significantly greater with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day (−15.58 [n = 283] and −14.88 [n = 289]; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (−11.61 [n = 204]). The MADRS effect sizes were 0.44 for quetiapine 300 mg/day and 0.47 for 600 mg/day (p < 0.001 vs placebo).
quetiapine 600 mg/day	placebo	improvement of disorder	17948	18531	By week 8, significantly higher proportions of patients treated with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day had achieved response and remission when compared with placebo. Among quetiapine-treated patients, 64.7% (300 mg/day) and 62.6% (600 mg/day) were classified as responders at week 8 compared with 49.0% of placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 for 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively; ITT, LOCF). When compared with placebo (46.1%), significantly more quetiapine-treated patients met remission criteria at week 8 (65.0% and 61.9%, respectively; p < 0.001 vs placebo; ITT, LOCF).
quetiapine 600 mg/day	placebo	improvement of disorder	-1	-1	Patients with bipolar II disorder stratified by a rapid- (≥4 mood episodes per year) or nonrapid-cycling course also demonstrated significant improvements in MADRS total score at week 8. Among patients without a rapid-cycling course, MADRS total score improved significantly by a mean (SE) of 15.18 (0.67) and 14.25 (0.66) with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day compared with 11.58 (0.75) points for placebo (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005 for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/day, respectively) at week 8.
