Whole-body vibration	Walking	Balance improvement 	24623	24771	The 8-month vibratory exercise is feasible and more effective than walking to improve two major determinants of bone fractures: hip BMD and balance.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Balance improvement 	14258	14335	The WBV group showed improved balance (29%), while the Walking group did not.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at the femoral neck	1619	1724	BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4.3% (P = 0.011) compared to the Walking group.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at other hip sites	13998	14189	The comparison of the changes in BMD at other sites on the hip showed a trend for the higher effectiveness of the vibratory exercise, but the difference did not reach statistical significance
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at other hip sites	13998	14190	The comparison of the changes in BMD at other sites on the hip showed a trend for the higher effectiveness of the vibratory exercise, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at the lumbar spine	1725	1795	In contrast, the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at the femoral neck	1603	1724	After 8 months, BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4.3% (P = 0.011) compared to the Walking group.
Whole-body vibration	Walking	BMI	14336	14410	The WBV group reduced more the BMI than the Walking group (3%; P = 0.049).
Whole-body vibration	Walking	Bone Mineral Density at the lumbar spine	1738	1795	the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups.
