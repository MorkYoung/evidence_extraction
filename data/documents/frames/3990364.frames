Flexibility training	Control	Sacral/hip range of motion	1404	1558	TG showed an increase in spinal inclination by 16.4% (P<0.05), in sacral/hip ROM by 29.2% (P<0.05), and in thoracic ROM by 22.5% (P>0.05) compared with CG
Flexibility training	Control	Sacral/hip range of motion	1377	1619	After the training period, TG showed an increase in spinal inclination by 16.4% (P<0.05), in sacral/hip ROM by 29.2% (P<0.05), and in thoracic ROM by 22.5% (P>0.05) compared with CG from maximum extension position to maximum bending position.
Flexibility training	Control	Lumbar spine range of motion	15926	16013	TG did not show any significant difference in the lumbar spine ROM compared with the CG
