LCI699	placebo	Levels of the cortisol precursor 11-deoxycortisol	44563	44805	Levels of the cortisol precursor 11-deoxycortisol increased with LCI699 at doses ≥ 100 mg (942% and 584% with 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively; P < 0.001 vs placebo), likely due to off-target inhibition of 11-β hydroxylase (results not shown).
LCI699	placebo	24-h urinary cortisol	44147	44400	Significant reductions in 24-h urinary cortisol (34–42%) were observed following single LCI699 doses of 30, 100 or 200 mg (vs 33% increase with placebo relative to time-matched baseline; P ≤ 0.001), but with no clear dose-dependence (results not shown).
eplerenon	placebo	ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels	-1	-1	By contrast, treatment with eplerenone 100 mg caused a progressive increase in pre-ACTH aldosterone levels 2 h post-dose (increase vs Day −2 pre-ACTH levels; Day 6, 29%; P ≤ 0.01 vs placebo) (Figure 7A). In eplerenone-treated subjects, ACTH stimulation on Day 6 resulted in a 63% increase in peak aldosterone levels.Figure 7
LCI699	placebo	plasma aldosterone concentration at 12 h	-1	-1	LCI699 reduced plasma aldosterone concentration at 12 h on Day 1 (0.5 mg, –49%; 1 mg, –47%; 3 mg, –63%; all P < 0.001 vs placebo);
LCI699	placebo	ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels	-1	-1	For ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels (Figure 7A), LCI699 0.5–3 mg resulted in peak inhibition of 41–64% from baseline (Day −2) on Day 6 (vs 7% reduction with placebo; P < 0.001).
eplerenon	placebo	Levels of the cortisol precursor 11-deoxycortisol	50929	51034	Eplerenone and lower doses of LCI699 had no significant effect on cortisol precursors on Day 6 or Day 13.
LCI699	placebo	plasma aldosterone concentration at 12 h	-1	-1	LCI699 reduced plasma aldosterone concentration at 12 h on Day 1 (0.5 mg, –49%; 1 mg, –47%; 3 mg, –63%; all P < 0.001 vs placebo)
