Exercise of moderate intensity	No exercise	Assessment of Mental State - PEPS and PSYCH	17174	17556	There were significant main effects where mental state differed between Exercise and No-Exercise trials and between the different levels of virtual environment exposure (F <NEWLINE>(4,68) = 3.37, p < 0.05). Post hoc analysis revealed increases in PEPS and PSYCH from Control to OSM and TSM during the Exercise trial, whereas MOT increased from Control to OSM and TSM in the No-Exercise trial
Exercise of moderate intensity	No exercise	Sense of presence in virtual immersive environment	1248	1413	Furthermore, these changes indicated that exercise augments the demands of virtual environment exposures and this likely contributed to an enhanced sense of presence
Exercise of moderate intensity	No exercise	Heart Rate in virtual immersive environment	16474	16679	Heart rates showed significant increases from rest to No-Exercise and Exercise trials (F <NEWLINE>(3,51) = 39.63, p < 0.05), and these changes were consistent across the three levels of virtual environment exposure
