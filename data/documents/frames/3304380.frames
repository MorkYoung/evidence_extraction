 Treatment alone	Scaling and root planning	Changes in gingival index, alteration in plaque index, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth.	16828	17068	Medicaments with or without SRP were effective [Post Hoc Dunnett T3 (group A vs. B, p <0.001), (group C vs. D, p=0.002)], although SRP itself, had no remarkable effect [Post Hoc Dunnett T3 (group B vs. D, p=0.516), (group A vs. C, p=0.096).
 Treatment alone	Scaling and root planning	Changes in gingival index, alteration in plaque index, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth.	1600	1753	no significant difference was observed between powder or extract therapy (p >0.05) and between patients received either SRP or treatment alone (p=0.169).
 Treatment alone	Scaling and root planning	Changes in gingival index, alteration in plaque index, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth.	17069	17181	Sole treatment with either SRP or medicament had the same impact [Post Hoc Dunnett T3 (group A vs. D), p=0.169],
 Treatment alone	Scaling and root planning	Changes in gingival index, alteration in plaque index, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth.	16387	16700	Significant inter group differences were observed after analysis of pooled data from combined groups considering all indices [F (3, 51.68) =16.01, p<0.001]. Collectively, group C showed better outcomes when calculating the overall improvement in all 4 indices [3.24(±1.18)], followed by group A, D and B (Table 2)
Group 4 (extract and SRP) and group 5 (powder and SRP) 	Group 1(only extract), group 2 (only powder), group 3 (no medicament and no SRP), and group 6 (only SRP)	Inflammatory indices	1343	1586	More precise analysis of data revealed that SRP in association with Frankincense application (either extract or powder) can lead to remarkable decrease in inflammatory indices in comparison to the groups without SRP and drug therapy (p<0.001).
Frankincense extract	Frankincense powder	Changes in gingival index, alteration in plaque index, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth.	1600	1753	no significant difference was observed between powder or extract therapy (p >0.05) and between patients received either SRP or treatment alone (p=0.169).
