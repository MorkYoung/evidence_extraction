0	12	bilastine	placebo	wheal and flare response	For inhibitory effects on wheal and flare response, bilastine 20 and 50 mg showed significant inhibition from 1.5 h after administration as compared with placebo, and the significant effect persisted for 24 h after administration.
1	13	bilastine	placebo	rates of adverse events ( AEs )	The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II.
2	27	bilastine	placebo	wheal and flare response	For inhibitory effects on wheal and flare response, bilastine 20 and 50 mg showed significant inhibition from 1.5 h after administration as compared with placebo, and the significant effect persisted for 24 h after administration.
3	28	bilastine	placebo	rates of adverse events ( AEs )	The rates of adverse events (AEs) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II.
4	249	bilastine	placebo	DSST score	Although significant differences in change in DSST score from baseline were observed at 2 and 24 h after repeated administration of 20 mg/day on Day 14, none of the bilastine doses (ranging from 10–50 mg) showed significant difference from placebo in DSST or SSS, indicating that bilastine has almost no effect on psychomotor activity in healthy Japanese subjects.
5	249	bilastine	placebo	DSST or SSS	Although significant differences in change in DSST score from baseline were observed at 2 and 24 h after repeated administration of 20 mg/day on Day 14, none of the bilastine doses (ranging from 10–50 mg) showed significant difference from placebo in DSST or SSS, indicating that bilastine has almost no effect on psychomotor activity in healthy Japanese subjects.
6	249	bilastine	placebo	psychomotor activity	Although significant differences in change in DSST score from baseline were observed at 2 and 24 h after repeated administration of 20 mg/day on Day 14, none of the bilastine doses (ranging from 10–50 mg) showed significant difference from placebo in DSST or SSS, indicating that bilastine has almost no effect on psychomotor activity in healthy Japanese subjects.
7	250	bilastine	placebo	rates of AEs	In both single- and multiple-dose administration, the rates of AEs were comparable between the bilastine and placebo groups.
