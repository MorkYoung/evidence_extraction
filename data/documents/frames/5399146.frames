able-bodied men without any intervention	2 mg of melatonin given 4 days for tetraplegic patients and placebo for tetraplegic patients	The absolute plasma concentration of activated FVII	1506	1637	The absolute plasma concentration of activated FVII was higher (P<0.05) among the able-bodied compared with the tetraplegic groups.
2 mg of melatonin given 4 days for tetraplegic patients and placebo for tetraplegic patients	able-bodied men without any intervention	circadian pattern for D-dimer	14575	14659	the circadian pattern for D-dimer was similar (P>0.05) across the three study groups
2 mg of melatonin given 4 days for tetraplegic patients and placebo for tetraplegic patients	able-bodied men without any intervention	circadian variation of F1+2	14366	14565	Compared with the able-bodied group, the tetraplegic groups with or without melatonin supplementation showed an apparent increase in the circadian variation of F1+2 (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively)
2 mg of melatonin given 4 days for tetraplegic patients and placebo for tetraplegic patients	able-bodied men without any intervention	circadian pattern for D-dimer	14366	14660	Compared with the able-bodied group, the tetraplegic groups with or without melatonin supplementation showed an apparent increase in the circadian variation of F1+2 (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively), whereas the circadian pattern for D-dimer was similar (P>0.05) across the three study groups.
2 mg of melatonin given 4 days for tetraplegic patients	placebo for tetraplegic patients	circadian variation of F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation, and D-dimer, a marker of activated coagulation and fibrinolysis	14088	14365	The circadian patterns of the F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation, and D-dimer, a marker of activated coagulation and fibrinolysis, were apparently similar (P>0.05) between the tetraplegic groups, that is, irrespective of whether they were given melatonin (Figures 2a and c).
