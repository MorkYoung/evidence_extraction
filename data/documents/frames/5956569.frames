Pre-invitation leaflet	Control	Cumulative uptake at 6 months	16470	16729	able 1 and Figure 2(b) suggest a slight increase in uptake for online booking by six months, but this was not statistically significant (Adj. OR = 1.10; 95% CI 0.94–1.28, p = 0.24). At six months, the marginal increase in uptake was 1.83% (95% CI −1.23–4.89).
Pre-invitation leaflet	Control	Cumulative uptake at 3 months	-1	-1	Figure 2(a) shows a Kaplan Meier plot of the cumulative uptake over time for PIL and control groups. There was an early increase in uptake for the PIL group immediately post invitation, but any small difference had dissipated by three months.
Pre-invitation leaflet	Control	Cumulative uptake at 6 months	-1	-1	The OR adjusted for baseline uptake compared with control was 0.97 (95% CI 0.88–1.06, p = 0.485) at three months and 1.01 (95% CI 0.93–1.11, p = 0.747) at six months.
