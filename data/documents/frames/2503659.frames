Telavancin 	Vancomycin	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus eradication rate	28431	28579	In addition, telavancin showed a higher eradication rate of MRSA than vancomycin (89.9% versus 85.4%), which again was not statistically significant
Telavancin 	Vancomycin	Cure rate	25798	25914	Overall cure rates were similar at 79% and 80% for telavancin and the standard therapy group respectively (p = 0.53)
Telavancin 	Vancomycin + cloxacillin	Staphylococcus aureus eradication rate 	26975	27131	. In terms of microbiologic eradication, telavancin trended towards a better outcome in patients with S. aureus than standard therapy (92% vs 78%, p = 0.07)
Telavancin 	Vancomycin + cloxacillin	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus eradication rate	27133	27242	but had a statistically significant better eradication rates in patients with MRSA (92% versus 68%, p = 0.04)
Telavancin 	Vancomycin + cloxacillin	Cure rate	26814	26975	In the 45 microbiologically evaluable patients with MRSA at baseline, cure rates were also 96% and 90% for telavancin and the standard therapy group respectively
Telavancin 	Vancomycin + cloxacillin	Cure rate	1228	1404	In two identical phase III trials comparing telavancin versus vancomycin at the doses of the FAST 2 study for cSSSI, the clinical cure rates were 88.3% and 87.1%, respectively.
Telavancin 	Vancomycin	Cure rate	28219	28428	Telavancin-treated patients with cSSSI caused by MRSA trended toward an overall better cure rate than vancomycin (90.6% versus 86.4%) which was not statistically significant (difference 4.1%, 95% CI, −1.1, 9.3
Telavancin 	Vancomycin + cloxacillin	Staphylococcus aureus eradication rate 	26977	27132	In terms of microbiologic eradication, telavancin trended towards a better outcome in patients with S. aureus than standard therapy (92% vs 78%, p = 0.07),
Telavancin 	Vancomycin	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus eradication rate	28431	28617	In addition, telavancin showed a higher eradication rate of MRSA than vancomycin (89.9% versus 85.4%), which again was not statistically significant (Difference 4.4%, 95%CI, −0.9%, 9.8%)
