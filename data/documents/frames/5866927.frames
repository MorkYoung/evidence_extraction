AUCB	Placebo	Stanford Binet�Knowledge	26674	26883	There were no statistically significant changes in the EOWPVT (Fig. 3A), ROWPVT (Fig. 3B), or Stanford Binet subscales (Fig. 3C, 3D) when subjects received placebo versus AUCB at 12 and 24 weeks post infusion.

AUCB	Placebo	Vineland Socialization	-1	-1	Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale for Socialization: F 1,27 = 5.08; p = .032 (false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted p‐value = .025) after 12 weeks; F 1,27 =1.95; p = .174 (FDR adjusted p‐value = .045) after 24 weeks.
AUCB	Placebo	Vineland Socialization	26884	27143	The score on the Vineland Socialization subscale was significant as scored per guidelines after 12 weeks for the AUCB group, but after applying the false discovery method for adjustment of multiple comparisons the scoring did not reach significance (Fig. 3E).
AUCB	Placebo	Vineland Socialization	27013	27132	after applying the false discovery method for adjustment of multiple comparisons the scoring did not reach significance
AUCB	Placebo	Vineland Socialization	27616	27919	The results of these ANCOVAs (Table 4) showed that all Vineland subscales had lower mean scores for the AUCB group than the placebo group at both 12 and 24 weeks. None of these differences were statistically significant after adjustment for baseline scores and using the FDR adjustment for multiplicity.
