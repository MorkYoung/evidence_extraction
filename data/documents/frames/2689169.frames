AWS laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Intubation success 	10591	10698	All 25 APs successfully intubated the trachea with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the Glidescope® and the AWS®
Glydescope laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Intubation success 	10591	10698	All 25 APs successfully intubated the trachea with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the Glidescope® and the AWS®
Glydescope laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Severity of dental compression	995	1311	Both the Glidescope® and the AWS® performed better than the Macintosh, and demonstrate considerable promise in this context. The AWS® had the least number of dental compressions in all three scenarios, and in the cervical spine immobilization scenario it required fewer maneuvers to optimize the view of the glottis.
AWS laryngoscope	Macintosh laryngoscope	Severity of dental compression	11090	11219	The severity of dental compression was significantly greater with the Macintosh compared to both the Glidescope® and AWS® devices
