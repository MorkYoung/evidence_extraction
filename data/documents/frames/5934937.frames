patients with heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, nausea or vomiting	patients without these symptoms	mean DSQ scores	-1	-1	At baseline (visit 2), patients with heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, nausea or vomiting had significantly higher (worse) mean DSQ scores than patients without these symptoms (all p < 0.05).
histologic response (≤6 eos/hpf) after treatment	no histologic response (>6 eos/hpf) after treatment	improvement in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score	24361	24660	Patients with a histologic response (≤6 eos/hpf) exhibited a greater improvement in DSQ scores from baseline (visit 2): mean change (±SD) [SES]: −16.2 (±14.3) [−1.09]; p < 0.0001 than those who did not have a histologic response (>6 eos/hpf): mean change: −9.9 (±11.6) [−0.67]; p < 0.0001 (Table 4).
