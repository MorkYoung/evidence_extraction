supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10	placebo	C-reactive protein	18841	19197	A significant difference between the active treatment and placebo groups could be demonstrated in the groups with the inflammation markers below median (CRP: P = 0.021; sP-selectin: P = 0.038), and a weaker evidence, significant at the P<0.1 (CRP: P = 0.053; sP-selectin; P = 0.054) was found in the groups with above median concentration of the biomarker.
