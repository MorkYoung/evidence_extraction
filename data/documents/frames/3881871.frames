MTA Fillapex sealer	ZnOE-based sealer (Roth-811)	Chromatic alterations	-1	-1	With regard to L*, a* and b* parameters, MTA Fillapex caused a statistically significant increase in a* (Î"a*to-t3=1.043, p<0.001) and b* (Î"b* to-t3=2.292, p<0.001) values. L* values remained stable. However, resultant Î"E values indicate that MTA Fillapex induced overall color changes below the human perceptibility threshold, ranging between 2.12-2.88 units. Roth 811 induced severe color changes exceeding the perceptibility threshold from the 1st week of evaluation (Î"E=5.65).
MTA Fillapex sealer	ZnOE-based sealer (Roth-811)	Chromatic alterations	18373	18643	The macroscopic examination of the sectioned specimens of Group 1 (MTA Fillapex) showed <NEWLINE>stability of sealer color within its mass and absence of dentinal staining (Figure 2). On the contrary, in Group 2 (Roth 811) the <NEWLINE>set sealer displayed a granular, grayish appearance.
