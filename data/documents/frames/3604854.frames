low dose intraoperative MMC (LDMMC)	standard dose MMC (SDMMC	Mean postoperative cylinder 3 and 6 month after PRK	7255	7421	Mean postoperative cylinder 3 and 6 month after PRK was 0.435 (SD 0.218) and 0.423 (SD 0.255) in LDMMC group and 0.435 (SD 0.247) and 0.426 (SD 0.261) in SDMMC group.
low dose intraoperative MMC (LDMMC)	standard dose MMC (SDMMC	Mean postoperative sphere in 3 and 6 months after PRK.	890	1078	Mean postoperative sphere in LDMMC group was −0.132 (SD 0.503) and −0.138 (SD 0.484) in 3 and 6 months after PRK. These results was −0.041 (SD 0.501) and −0.076 (SD 0.489) for SDMMC group.
low dose intraoperative MMC (LDMMC)	standard dose MMC (SDMMC	haze formation rate	7937	8124	Comparison of haze formation rate in these two groups by Mann-Whitney test demonstrated no significant difference in results (P = 0.104 3rd month and P = 0.156 6th month after operation).
low dose intraoperative MMC (LDMMC)	standard dose MMC (SDMMC	The mean preoperative refraction and cylinder	702	889	The mean preoperative refraction in LDMMC eyes was −3.08 (SD 1.65) sphere and 0.92 (SD 0.88) cylinder. These values for SDMMC eyes were −3.25 (SD 1.80) sphere and 0.81 (SD 0.84) cylinder.
low dose intraoperative MMC (LDMMC)	standard dose MMC (SDMMC	Mean postoperative sphere in 3 and 6 months after PRK.	8967	9201	Our findings shows that low dose intraoperative MMC has the same effect as standard dose in prevention of corneal haze and visual outcomes have no meaningful difference while it promises lower side effects and long-term complications.
