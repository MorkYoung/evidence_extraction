Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	adverse events	25770	25886	No adverse events were reported by patients, neither in the electrophysiological nor in the therapeutical tDCS study
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration 	24355	24659	Migraine frequency reduction was more pronounced during the second month of therapy, with a mean decrease from 5 to 3 attacks (âˆ’38%; p = 0.03), the number of migraine days also decreased from 8 to 4.3 (48%, p = 0.002), and noteworthy the average attack duration dropped from 88.5 to 33.2 (60%, p = 0.02).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	acute medication intake	2063	2396	Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05), and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	acute medication intake	23773	23971	The average cumulative attack duration over 2 months decreased from 184 to 119 hours (35%, p = 0.043), and the average acute treatment intake dropped from 18 tablets to 13 in two months (p = 0.041).
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration 	2063	2325	Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA: migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre-treatment baseline (all p < 0.05),
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	baseline	adverse events	25770	25991	No adverse events were reported by patients, neither in the electrophysiological nor in the therapeutical tDCS study, but a light itching sensation that invariantly disappeared in few minutes after the end of stimulation.
