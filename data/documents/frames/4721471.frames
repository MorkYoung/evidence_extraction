Healthy Eating and Active Living for Diabetes (HEALD) intervention	control	Daily pedometer determined steps	1138	1253	The intervention group increased their physical activity by 918 steps/day [95% CI 116, 1666] compared to usual care
Healthy Eating and Active Living for Diabetes (HEALD) intervention	control	Daily pedometer determined steps	14030	14240	Daily pedometer determined steps increased for the intervention compared to usual care control at 3-months (1292 [SD 2698] vs. 418 [SD 2458]) and 6-months (1481 [SD 2631] vs. 336 [SD 2712]; adjusted p = 0.002).
Healthy Eating and Active Living for Diabetes (HEALD) intervention	usual care	total costs	14408	15207	. HEALD cost $340 per participant, with nearly 60% related to intervention activities and training of the exercise specialists. With the exception of the intervention cost, intervention participants incurred less cost in all categories (physician, out- and in-patient costs) compared to the controls during the follow-up period. The unadjusted mean difference in total cost (intervention plus health care utilization) between groups was insignificant ($4). However, excluding the intervention cost, average cost per intervention participant would be $336 less than for control patients. HEALD participants also incurred fewer costs in the pre-enrollment period. After adjusting for pre-enrolment cost and BMI, the adjusted incremental cost was $102 (Table 2), although not statistically significant.
