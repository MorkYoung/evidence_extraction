Superion® (63/120, 52.5%)	X-STOP® (49/129, 38.0%)	subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint - moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.	1141	1305	At 3 years, the proportion of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint was greater for Superion® (63/120, 52.5%) than for X-STOP® (49/129, 38.0%) (P=0.023)
Superion® (63/120, 52.5%)	X-STOP® (49/129, 38.0%)	degradation in clinical success - moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.	10756	10973	The subjects implanted with the Superion® showed no degradation in clinical success compared to the 24-month endpoint analysis (53%), whereas X-STOP® subjects showed a modest degradation over the same timeframe (50%).
Superion® (63/120, 52.5%)	X-STOP® (49/129, 38.0%)	leg pain - moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.	11592	11744	Five of six comparisons qualitatively favored treatment with the Superion® device; however, only the leg pain results achieved statistical significance.
Superion® (63/120, 52.5%)	X-STOP® (49/129, 38.0%)	leg pain - moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.	11402	12022	Table 2 provides the 36-month success rates for pain severity as well as back- and disease-specific outcomes based on the minimal clinically important difference criteria for each variable. Five of six comparisons qualitatively favored treatment with the Superion® device; however, only the leg pain results achieved statistical significance. Inspection of the line graphs for each outcome captures both the durability of the Superion® results and the modest degradation in X-STOP® results between 24 and 36 months for the ZCQ (Figure 1) as well as for back and leg pain severity (Figure 2) and back function (Figure 3).
