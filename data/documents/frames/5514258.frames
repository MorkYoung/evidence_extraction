major salivary gland cancer in high risk group plus adjuvant radiation therapy	major salivary gland cancer in high risk group without adjuvant radiation therapy	survival	1439	1613	Patients in the high-risk group had greater survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; P = .002; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.91) if they received adjuvant radiation therapy.
major salivary gland cancer in low/intermediate risk group plus adjuvant radiation therapy	major salivary gland cancer in low/intermediate risk group without adjuvant radiation therapy	survival	1627	1827	patients in the intermediate- (HR, 1.01; P = .904; 95% CI, 0.85-1.20) and low-risk groups (HR, 0.85; P = .427; 95% CI, 0.57-1.26) did not experience a survival benefit with adjuvant radiation therapy.
