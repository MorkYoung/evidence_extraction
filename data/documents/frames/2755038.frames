patients with 70% or more restenosis in the first year	less than 70% restenosis in the first year	The incidence of ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke or transient ischaemic attack	25596	25873	The incidence of ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke or transient ischaemic attack was significantly higher in patients with 70% or more restenosis that was diagnosed within the first year after treatment compared with those who had less than 70% restenosis in the first year.
endovascular arm	angioplasty alone	≥50% restenosis	23737	23913	The secondary outcome (≥50% restenosis) also occurred more frequently in the endovascular arm than in the surgery arm (109 vs 59; adjusted HR 2·58, 95% CI 1·87–3·55; p<0·0001).
endovascular arm	angioplasty alone	the risks of 50% or more restenosis	24389	24706	Of the patients who were assigned to endovascular treatment, the risks of 70% or more restenosis (adjusted HR 0·43, 0·19–0·97; p=0·04) and 50% or more restenosis (0·37, 0·21–0·62; p=0·0003) were significantly lower in those patients treated with a stent than in those treated by angioplasty alone (table 4, figure 2).
