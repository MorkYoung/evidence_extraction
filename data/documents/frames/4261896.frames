Printed educational materials	No intervention	Eye examination rates	16714	17442	Neither the unadjusted nor the adjusted results show any evidence that the interventions (alone or in combination), were effective in increasing rates of eye examination among eligible trial patients. The widest confidence interval reported in the table, an odds ratio between 0.94 and 1.04 for the insert + outsert + reminder notepad, corresponds to a true absolute effect of the intervention lying between a decrease in retinal screening of 1.3% and an increase of 1.1%. Thus, the estimate of effect for the presumably strongest 'dose' of intervention is of trivial clinical value, is not statistically significantly superior compared no intervention, and the confidence interval does not contain values of clinical importance
