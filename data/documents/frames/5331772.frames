High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Baseline characteristics	12103	12198	There was no significant difference between three groups regarding the baseline characteristics
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)	1284	1528	In spite of this, analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (P = 0.093), MCP-1(P = 0.075), and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = 0.164).
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	VO2max	12340	12505	Tukey's post hoc test revealed increased VO2max in both "exercise + ginger" (P < 0.000) and "exercise + placebo" (P < 0.000) groups, in comparison to "ginger" group.
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)	1302	1528	analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (P = 0.093), MCP-1(P = 0.075), and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = 0.164).
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Baseline characteristics	12103	12216	There was no significant difference between three groups regarding the baseline characteristics [Tables 1 and 2].
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10)	1302	1528	analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (P = 0.093), MCP-1(P = 0.075), and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = 0.164).
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo	Ginger alone	Density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein (MCP-1)	1302	1528	analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (P = 0.093), MCP-1(P = 0.075), and serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) (P = 0.164).
