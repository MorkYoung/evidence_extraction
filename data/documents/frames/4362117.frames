One month after systemic doxycycline during the reevaluation visit 45 days after the completion of scaling and root planing (SRP)	control group (CG) received only scaling and root planing (SRP)	percentage of Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)	16465	16631	One month after the administration of doxycycline, both Pg, and Pi showed significant reduction in the percentage of site for TG compared with CG (p<0.01 and p=0.04).
One month after systemic doxycycline during the reevaluation visit 45 days after the completion of scaling and root planing (SRP)	control group (CG) received only scaling and root planing (SRP)	percentage of Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)	16367	16631	The results showing the effect of systemic doxycycline on Pg and Pi are shown in Figures 1B & 1C. One month after the administration of doxycycline, both Pg, and Pi showed significant reduction in the percentage of site for TG compared with CG (p<0.01 and p=0.04).
One month after administeration systemic doxycycline after the completion of scaling and root planing (SRP)	control group (CG) received only scaling and root planing (SRP)	decline in the percentage of sites harboring Tannerella forsythia (Tf)	15827	15996	In the first month after administering doxycycline, a significantly higher decline in the percentage of sites harboring Tf was observed for TG compared with CG (p=0.02).
