capsaicin	placebo	skin reactions	27858	28122	Seventeen of 23 (74%) capsaicin treated patients and 6 of 20 (30%) placebo treated patients reported one or more skin reactions on the application site (P = 0.006, Fischer's exact test, table 5). No other adverse events or complications were observed in the study.
capsaicin	placebo	intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) to 1 month	1648	1863	Changes in IENFD on the pain side, from baseline to 1 month after patch application, did not differ between capsaicin and placebo treatment: 1.9 [−0.1 to 3.9] and 0.6 [−1.2 to 2.5] fibers/mm, respectively (P = 0.32)
capsaicin	placebo	The maximum difference in summed pain intensity differences (SPID)	1549	1647	No differences in SPID between treatments were observed at 2 and 3 months after patch application.
capsaicin	placebo	skin reactions	27858	28053	Seventeen of 23 (74%) capsaicin treated patients and 6 of 20 (30%) placebo treated patients reported one or more skin reactions on the application site (P = 0.006, Fischer's exact test, table 5).
