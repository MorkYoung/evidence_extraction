Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Time to first pulmonary exacerbation	15376	15677	The median time to pulmonary exacerbation by Kaplan–Meier analysis was 134 days for the DRCFI group and 58 days for the placebo group, although this achieved conventional statistical significance only on the per protocol population (p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol, by log-rank test; see figure 3).
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Requirement of antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation	15076	15304	Post hoc analysis revealed that the overall proportion of subjects requiring antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation was lower in the DRCFI group (8 (40%) vs 17 (77%), OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, p=0.027 by Fisher's exact test).
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Systemic adverse events	1564	1661	DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Time to first pulmonary exacerbation	1442	1563	DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation (median 134 vs 58 days, p=0.057 mITT, p=0.046 per protocol).
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Requirement of antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation	15112	15279	overall proportion of subjects requiring antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation was lower in the DRCFI group (8 (40%) vs 17 (77%), OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, p=0.027
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	Systemic adverse events	1564	1698	DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group, but fewer pulmonary adverse events.
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	CFU/g reduction in bacterial density of Pseudomona aeruginosa 	1296	1441	DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002).
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	FEV1, SGRQ total score, and 6MWT distance	15679	15992	No significant differences were seen between the two treatment groups for changes to day 28 for other outcome measures including FEV1 (DRCFI −0.05±0.12 vs placebo 0.00±0.10 L, p=0.18), SGRQ total score (DRCFI −1.3±7.16 vs placebo −6.4±9.8, p=0.08) or 6MWT distance (DRCFI 0.6±71.6 vs placebo −7.6±92.3 m, p=0.54).
Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI)	Placebo	CFU/g reduction in bacterial density of Pseudomona aeruginosa 	1296	1439	DRCFI resulted in a mean (SD) 4.2 (3.7) log10 CFU/g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 (vs −0.08 (3.8) with placebo, p=0.002
