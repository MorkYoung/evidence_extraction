subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method 	intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method	Allogeneic transfusion requirements	13483	13670	Allogeneic transfusion requirements between patients in the subcutaneous drainage and intraarticular drainage groups (6.4% versus 24.1%) were significantly different (P = 0.002, Table 3).
subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method 	intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method	The hidden blood loss after TKA	13036	13207	The hidden blood loss after TKA was significantly different between two groups (P < 0.001) [Table 2]. There was more hidden blood loss in the subcutaneous group (Group A).
subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method 	intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method	Allogeneic transfusion requirements	1495	1659	Allogenic transfusion requirements between subcutaneous drainage group and intraarticular drainage groups (6.4% vs. 24.1%) were significantly different (P = 0.002).
subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method 	intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method	The total blood loss after Total knee arthroplasty (TKA)	12660	12849	The total blood loss after TKA was significantly different between two groups (P = 0.04). The total blood loss (visible drained blood + hidden loss) was less in subcutaneous drainage group.
subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method 	intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method	The mean visible blood drainage during the first 24 h and between 24 and 48 h after TKA	12850	13035	The mean visible blood drainage in subcutaneous drainage group was significantly less than intraarticular drainage group, both during the first 24 h and between 24 and 48 h (P < 0.001).
