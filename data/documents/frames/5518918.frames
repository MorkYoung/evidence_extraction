Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	Health-related quality of life	1719	1905	We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life.
Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	Satisfaction 	827	886	satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02).
Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	Satisfaction 	771	886	Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02).
Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	PeakVO2 	-1	-1	Patients in both groups improved their peakVO2 from baseline to discharge from CR (centre-based +11% p < 0.01, home-based + 15% p < 0.01) without significant between-group differences (p = 0.25).
Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	Healthcare costs	1193	1344	Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval –562 to 1436, p = 0.39).
Home-based training with telemonitoring	Centre-based training	Physical fitness	887	1072	Physical fitness improved at discharge (p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87)

From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval –460 to 6780, p = 0.09)
