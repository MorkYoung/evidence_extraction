FACETS programme	Control	Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale improvement 	16856	17050	For the MSIS-29 physical subscale (p = 0.046, SES = −0.23) and the vitality subscale of the SF-36 (p = 0.03, SES = 0.37) there was a significant difference in favour of the FACETS arm at 1 year.
FACETS programme	Control	Adverse events	16760	16821	No adverse events, as defined in the protocol, were reported.
FACETS programme	Control	Self-efficacy	1120	1514	The benefits demonstrated at 4-months in the FACETS arm for fatigue severity and self-efficacy largely persisted, with a slight reduction in standardised effect sizes (SES) (−0.29, p = 0.06 and 0.34, p = 0.09, respectively). There was a significant difference on the MS Impact Scale favouring FACETS that had not been present at 4-months (SES −0.24, p = 0.046). No adverse events were reported.
