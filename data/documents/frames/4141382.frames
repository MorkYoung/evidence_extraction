Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine	Caudal Sufentanil + Adrenaline	Anesthetics during surgery	11303	11492	Their intraoperative anesthetic consumption was lesser when compared to patients who received caudal sufentanil alone or in combination with adrenaline (Group CSu = Group CSuAdr) (P < 0.02)
IV Sufentanil 	Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine	Isoflurane consumption	11172	11301	The isoflurane consumption (ml/kg/h) was similar among the patients from Group IVSu, Group CSuNeo, and Group CSuNeoAdr (P > 0.05)
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine	Caudal Sufentanil + Adrenaline	VAS sedation	11616	11755	However, patients who received caudal neostigmine had lower VAS sedation and were classified as more awake at the reversal time (P < 0.005)
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine 	Caudal Sufentanil 	Dipyrone needed	12415	12572	However, patients who received caudal sufentanil and caudal neostigmine (Group CSuNeo and Group CSuNeoAdr) needed lesser doses in 24 h evaluation (P < 0.005)
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine + Adrenaline	Caudal Sufentanil 	Time needed for rescue analgesics 	11974	12211	he time to first administration of rescue analgesics for patients who received caudal sufentanil plus neostigmine (Group CSuNeo and Group CSuNeoAdr) was similar, but higher when compared to the other groups (10-11 h, P < 0.05) [Table 3].
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine + Adrenaline	Caudal Sufentanil 	Time needed for rescue analgesics 	11973	12200	The time to first administration of rescue analgesics for patients who received caudal sufentanil plus neostigmine (Group CSuNeo and Group CSuNeoAdr) was similar, but higher when compared to the other groups (10-11 h, P < 0.05)
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine	Caudal Sufentanil + Adrenaline	VAS sedation	1416	1576	VAS for sedation on reversal of anesthesia showed the following association: Group CSuNeo = Group CSuNeoAdr < Group CSu = Group CSuAdr = Group IVSu (P < 0.005).
Caudal Sufentanil + neostigmine	Caudal Sufentanil + Adrenaline	Anesthetics during surgery	11172	11503	The isoflurane consumption (ml/kg/h) was similar among the patients from Group IVSu, Group CSuNeo, and Group CSuNeoAdr (P > 0.05). Their intraoperative anesthetic consumption was lesser when compared to patients who received caudal sufentanil alone or in combination with adrenaline (Group CSu = Group CSuAdr) (P < 0.02) [Table 3].
