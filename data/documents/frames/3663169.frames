silicone gel	control group	pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and height	11843	11974	The final assessment at 8th week showed that differences observed between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
silicone gel	control group	pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and height of the scar	1658	1832	The differences were statistically significant in all parameters, including pigmentation (P = 0.001), Vascularity (P = 0.010), pliability (P = 0.001), and height (P = 0.010).
silicone gel	control group	pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and height of the scar	1579	1832	the silicone gel scars were scored lower when compared with the control scars. The differences were statistically significant in all parameters, including pigmentation (P = 0.001), Vascularity (P = 0.010), pliability (P = 0.001), and height (P = 0.010).
