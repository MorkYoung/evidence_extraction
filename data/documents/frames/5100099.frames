Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Cardiac index improvement	-1	-1	Cardiac index during NAVA compared to CV did not statistically differ.
Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Systolic arterial pressure	1665	1790	With regard to hemodynamics, systolic arterial pressures were higher using NAVA: +8.4 % (95 % CI: +3.3 to +13.6 %, P = 0.03).
Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Systolic arterial pressure	1665	1789	With regard to hemodynamics, systolic arterial pressures were higher using NAVA: +8.4 % (95 % CI: +3.3 to +13.6 %, P = 0.03)
Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Cardiac index improvement	1791	1897	There were no statistically significant differences on cardiac index between the two modes of ventilation.
Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Blood pH levels	-1	-1	There were no statistically significant differences on blood pH levels between the two modes of ventilation (7.32?±?0.02 vs. 7.32?±?0.04, P?=?0.34).
Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist	Conventional Ventilation	Peak inspiratory pressures	1539	1663	Ventilation with NAVA delivered lower peak inspiratory pressures than with CV: -32.7 % (95 % CI: -48.2 to –17.1 %, P = 0.04)
