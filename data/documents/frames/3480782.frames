Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Preferred intranasal corticosteroid	2119	2222	FLP was preferred over CIC with respect to scent, soothing feel and nasal irritation, and also overall.
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Immediate efficacy	1733	1805	There was no statistically significant difference in immediate efficacy.
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Sensory attributes	12257	12641	Regarding sensory attributes, patient ratings favored FLP over CIC with respect to satisfying scent, soothing feel and nasal irritation. Thirty seven (50%) patients preferred FLP compared to 6 (8.11%) preferring CIC with regards to satisfying scent (P < 0.001); 42 (56.76%) reported FLP to provide a more soothing feel compared to 15 (20.27%) preferring CIC in this regard (P < 0.001)
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Sensory attributes	12257	12787	Regarding sensory attributes, patient ratings favored FLP over CIC with respect to satisfying scent, soothing feel and nasal irritation. Thirty seven (50%) patients preferred FLP compared to 6 (8.11%) preferring CIC with regards to satisfying scent (P < 0.001); 42 (56.76%) reported FLP to provide a more soothing feel compared to 15 (20.27%) preferring CIC in this regard (P < 0.001). Only 1 (1.35%) patient reported nasal irritation following FLP administration, in contrast to 21 (28.38%) following ciclesonide use (P = 0.002).
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Urge to sneeze, aftertaste, run down to throat, and run off from nose following the use of intranasal corticosteroids 	12788	13138	Although, only one patient (1.35%) had urge to sneeze following FLP use, compared to 10 following CIC (13.51%), this difference was not statistically significant. The number reporting immediate taste, aftertaste, run down to throat and run off from nose were less with CIC compared to FLP, but these differences were also insignificant statistically.
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Preferred intranasal corticosteroid	1439	1732	Patients (58% males; pooled median age 32 years [Interquartile range, IQR, 25–41]; pooled median symptom duration 24 months [IQR 12–72]) preferred FLP over CIC nasal spray overall (55.41% vs. 25.68%, P = 0.007) and also with respect to attributes of scent, soothing feel, and nasal irritation.
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Immediate efficacy	1733	1804	There was no statistically significant difference in immediate efficacy
Ciclesonide (CIC)	Fluticasone propionate (FLP)	Preferred intranasal corticosteroid	1439	1649	Patients (58% males; pooled median age 32 years [Interquartile range, IQR, 25–41]; pooled median symptom duration 24 months [IQR 12–72]) preferred FLP over CIC nasal spray overall (55.41% vs. 25.68%, P = 0.007)
