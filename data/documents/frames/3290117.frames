NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	Mean Ki-67	1178	1238	Mean Ki-67 for NC + BC was 7% versus 29% with NC (P = 0.14).
NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	mean BMI	950	1094	The NC + BC (n = 5) group had a lower mean BMI at the conclusion of NC compared with those (n = 5) in the NC group (28.0 versus 35.8, P = 0.03).
NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	Final tumor size	1095	1177	Final tumor size was 2.59 cm in the NC + BC group versus 3.16 cm for NC (P = 0.76)
NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	mean BMI	13851	14047	BMI in the control group was 35.8 (35.8 ± 2.7), versus 28.0 (28.0 ± 1.0) in the bootcamp group after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.03, Table 2).
NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	C-peptide (ng/mL)	848	949	There were no initial differences between groups in regards to tumor size, C-peptide, BMI, and Ki–67.
NC with supervised bootcamp (NC + BC)	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) alone	C-peptide (ng/mL)	1239	1335	C-peptide (ng/mL) was equivalent between the two groups (4.55 NC + BC versus 4.74 NC, P = 0.85).
