duloxetine 60 mg	placebo	8 in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST)	18321	18476	The difference from placebo was not significant for the duloxetine group (Δ +1.21, 95% CI: −0.23, 2.65; P=0.099), with a standardized effect size of 0.176.
vortioxetine (10–20 mg)	placebo	8 in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST)	-1	-1	The difference from placebo was significant for vortioxetine (Î" +1.75, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.21; P=0.019; ANCOVA, OC), with a standardized effect size of 0.254 (Table 2 and Figure 3).
duloxetine 60 mg	placebo	Trail Making Test B Total Time	19359	19741	Trail Making Test B Total Time (Δ −9.67, 95% CI: −15.38, −3.96; P<0.001; ANCOVA, OC) was significantly improved with vortioxetine compared with placebo. None of the other secondary end points of cognitive function improved significantly with vortioxetine. No significant benefit was found with duloxetine compared with placebo on any of the secondary measures of cognitive function.
vortioxetine (10–20 mg)	placebo	8 in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST)	1344	1415	Vortioxetine was statistically superior to placebo on the DSST (P<0.05)
vortioxetine (10–20 mg)	placebo	Trail Making Test B Total Time	19359	19511	Trail Making Test B Total Time (Δ −9.67, 95% CI: −15.38, −3.96; P<0.001; ANCOVA, OC) was significantly improved with vortioxetine compared with placebo.
vortioxetine (10–20 mg)	placebo	CGI-I score	18925	19119	Vortioxetine produced a statistically significant improvement in disease severity compared with placebo in reducing the CGI-I score at week 8 (Δ −0.29, 95% CI: −0.53, −0.05; P<0.05) (Figure 4b).
duloxetine 60 mg	placebo	8 in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST)	1641	1717	Duloxetine was not significantly different from placebo on the DSST or UPSA,
duloxetine 60 mg	placebo	Trail Making Test B Total Time	19615	19741	No significant benefit was found with duloxetine compared with placebo on any of the secondary measures of cognitive function.
vortioxetine (10–20 mg)	duloxetine 60 mg	8 in the digit symbol substitution test (DSST)	19743	20043	An additional analysis of the comparative effects of vortioxetine and duloxetine was conducted on the change from baseline on DSST total number of correct symbols at week 8. The effect of vortioxetine was not significantly different from duloxetine (Δ +0.54, 95% CI: −0.89, 1.96; P=0.46; ANCOVA, OC).
