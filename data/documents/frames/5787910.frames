Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Baseline characteristics, except gender	12481	12628	there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of family history of acne and frequency of previous acne treatments (P > 0.05).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Frequency of side effects	17398	17747	a significant difference can be seen in the frequency of side effects dry mouth, dry nose, repeated rhinorrhea, and hair thinning and loss in both groups (P < 0.05), so that the frequency of side effects in the group receiving a higher dose of the drug (the second group) was more than the group receiving the low dose of the drug (the first group).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Frequency of side effects	17335	17747	As shown in Table 1, considering the significance level of 5%, a significant difference can be seen in the frequency of side effects dry mouth, dry nose, repeated rhinorrhea, and hair thinning and loss in both groups (P < 0.05), so that the frequency of side effects in the group receiving a higher dose of the drug (the second group) was more than the group receiving the low dose of the drug (the first group).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Patients' satisfaction score	16994	17333	the average of patients' satisfaction score in the first group (mean = 4.78, SD = 0.4) was significantly higher than the second group (mean = 4.43, SD = 0.6) (P = 0.02), which shows that the satisfaction of patients treated with lower doses of medication (Group I) was higher than patients treated with higher doses of the drug (Group II).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Baseline characteristics, except gender	11883	12072	there was no statistically significant difference between age results (P = 0.911). Similarly, the average age and duration of acne did not differ significantly in the two groups (P > 0.05).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Mean acne severity	812	930	The average severity of acne in the two treatment groups did not differ significantly within any of the study periods.
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Patients' satisfaction score	16837	17333	Considering the significance level of 5%, a significant difference can be observed between patients' satisfaction in the two treatment groups (P < 0.05), so the average of patients' satisfaction score in the first group (mean = 4.78, SD = 0.4) was significantly higher than the second group (mean = 4.43, SD = 0.6) (P = 0.02), which shows that the satisfaction of patients treated with lower doses of medication (Group I) was higher than patients treated with higher doses of the drug (Group II).
Conventional isotretinoin dose	Low-dose isotretinoin 	Baseline characteristics, except gender	11883	12628	there was no statistically significant difference between age results (P = 0.911). Similarly, the average age and duration of acne did not differ significantly in the two groups (P > 0.05). Frequency distributions of qualitative research variables including gender differed significantly in the two groups, because 5 participants in the first group (13.9%) and 8 participants in the second group (26.7%), which added up to 13 (19.7%), were male, whereas 31 participants in the first group (86.1%) and 22 (73.3%) in the second group (which added up to 53 or 80.3%) were female (P = 0.011). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of family history of acne and frequency of previous acne treatments (P > 0.05).
