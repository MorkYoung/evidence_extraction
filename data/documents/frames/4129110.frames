high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	intend to continue	2319	2476	HIFT participants spent significantly less time exercising per week, yet were able to maintain exercise enjoyment and were more likely to intend to continue.
high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	BMI	2182	2243	No significant changes in BMI or body composition were found.
high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	BMI	16079	16155	BMI did not significantly change from baseline to posttest for either group.
high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	Time spent completing daily workouts	17161	17311	Time spent completing daily workouts was greater for ART (M = 63.3 ± 3.3 minutes) than HIFT participants (M = 13.3 ± 6.4 min; t(16) = 43.5, p < .001).
high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	Workouts	2244	2295	Workouts were shorter for HIFT than ART (p < .001).
high-intensity functional training (HIFT)	moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (ART)	exercise initiation	14567	15525	Twenty-two participants provided reasons for exercise initiation, with many listing multiple reasons. Overall, 9 participants (39.1%) listed only intrinsic reasons and 13 (56.5%) listed both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. For the ART participants, extrinsic reasons included wanting to lose weight (n = 7) and to work with a trainer (n = 2). Intrinsic reasons included to have motivation to exercise (n = 4), to develop an exercise habit (n = 3), to improve fitness/get into shape (n = 3), to learn new exercises/gain knowledge (n = 3), to lose stress (n = 1), and to learn about nutrition (n = 1). HIFT participants were also extrinsically motivated to participate by wanting to lose weight (n = 5). Intrinsic reasons included to have the motivation to exercise (n = 4), to develop an exercise habit (n = 3), to improve health (n = 3), to see results (n = 3), to improve fitness/get into shape (n = 2), and to be exposed to a new type of exercise (n = 1).
