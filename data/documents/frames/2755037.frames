endovascular treatment	endarterectomy	combined outcome of non-perioperative stroke or TIA - patients with carotid artery stenosis	18869	19075	The combined outcome of non-perioperative stroke or TIA was more common in the endovascular group than it was in the endarterectomy group, but the difference was not significant (HR 1·37, 95% CI 0·95–1·97).
endovascular treatment	endarterectomy	cranial nerve palsies - patients with carotid artery stenosis	16311	16417	there were more cranial nerve palsies in the endarterectomy group than in the endovascular group (0 vs 22)
endovascular treatment	endarterectomy	death within 30 days of treatment - patients with carotid artery stenosis	15990	16148	The rates of any stroke that lasted for more than 7 days or death within 30 days of treatment were well matched between the treatment groups (10% in each arm)
endovascular treatment	endarterectomy	rates of any stroke that lasted for more than 7 days - patients with carotid artery stenosis	15990	16149	The rates of any stroke that lasted for more than 7 days or death within 30 days of treatment were well matched between the treatment groups (10% in each arm).
endovascular treatment	endarterectomy	minor strokes that lasted fewer than 7 days within 30 days of treatment - patients with carotid artery stenosis	16161	16305	more minor strokes that lasted fewer than 7 days within 30 days of treatment in the endovascular group than in the endarterectomy group (8 vs 1)
