Remifentanil 	Placebo 	Heart rate 	1229	1414	The HR was significantly lower, immediately after extubation and 3, 5, and 10 minutes after extubation, in both magnesium and remifentanil groups, compared to normal saline (P < 0.001).
Magnesium sulfate	Remifentanil	Double burst time	1591	1750	Mean (± SD) DBT 100% was significantly higher in magnesium group (30.2 ± 15.3) vs. remifenatnil (13.6 ± 6.8) and normal saline (13.5 ± 8.2) groups (P < 0.001).
