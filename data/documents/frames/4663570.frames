Agave derived fructans 	Breast milk	Serum ferritin	21537	22103	Comparing the average of the mean concentration of samples at the end (three months of age), those at baseline (around 20 days old), and the variables ΔC-reactive protein concentration and Δserum ferritin, the differences were not statistically significant (Wilcoxon test p = 0.05) among groups (Table 3). When data were analyzed by comparison of cesarean and vaginal delivery, the differences were not statistically significant in relation to the concentrations of C-reactive protein (initial, final) and ferritin (initial, final) (Fisher Student T-Test: p > 0.05).
