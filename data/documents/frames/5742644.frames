Haloperidol	Placebo	Brain regions with adaptive coding 	1276	1344	Finally, there were no adaptive coding effects in any brain regions.
Haloperidol	Placebo	Habituation from phase I to phase III	-1	-1	Under placebo in phase I, activity increased as a function of stimulation magnitude (absolute coding), and this effect was absent in phase III (i.e., habituation). Under haloperidol, however, there was no significant habituation from phase I to phase III.
Haloperidol	Placebo	Subjective well-being	22485	22751	The 2 × 3 ANOVA on subjective well-being (mean rating across seven side effects) with drug (placebo/haloperidol) and time (before drug intake, after 2.5 h, at the end) revealed neither a main effect of drug nor an interaction between time and drug (all p's > 0.531).
Haloperidol	Placebo	Brain regions with adaptive coding 	31243	31730	we identified brain regions with adaptively coded responses to stimulation outcome irrespective of drug treatment (i.e., main effect of adaptive coding). FWE-corrected whole brain analysis did not reveal any significant effects. Subsequently, a SVC was performed, using the insula and ACC as masks (see "Introduction" section: Ploner et al., 2011; Leknes et al., 2013); this analysis also did not reveal any significant main effects or interactions (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected, k > 5 voxel)
Haloperidol	Placebo	Stimulation outcomes	27260	27644	A 2 × 3 × 2 ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of context (F(1.79,34.07) = 75.65; p < 0.0001) and a significant interaction between context and stimulation outcome (F(1.34 25.54) = 4.09; p = 0.043), but no interaction with the factor drug (other p's > 0.089). Separate post hoc <NEWLINE>t-tests for each context revealed no difference between both stimulation outcomes (all p's > 0.093).
Haloperidol	Placebo	Discrimination between stimulation intensities	37956	38066	participants were equally able to differentiate between stimulation intensities irrespective of time and drug.
Haloperidol	Placebo	Stimulation outcomes	27526	27644	Separate post hoc <NEWLINE>t-tests for each context revealed no difference between both stimulation outcomes (all p's > 0.093).
