Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Trismus	12559	12725	There were no significant differences for trismus between none of them by measuring the mouth opening (p<0.71) before surgery, at 48 hours and at 7 days after surgery
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Trismus	1250	1402	No statistically significant differences were observed for pain (p<0.06), trismus (p<0.71) and swelling (p<0.05) between the test and the control group.
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Swelling	14180	14310	In this study, there are not statistically significant differences for trismus, pain and swelling, comparing both type of sutures.
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Rates of pain	1250	1402	No statistically significant differences were observed for pain (p<0.06), trismus (p<0.71) and swelling (p<0.05) between the test and the control group.
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Swelling	18201	18480	The results of this study show that there are no statistically significant differences in terms of pain, swelling and trismus between the complete and partial closure in which the usual suture technique is simplified and no complete suture of the relieving incision is performed.
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Swelling	12748	12997	Regarding swelling, there were no significant differences for horizontal (p<0.73), vertical (p<0.37) and oblique (p<0.83) facial measurements taken prior, at 48 hours and at 7 days after surgery, between the distinct suture techniques in both groups
Hermetical closure of the wound	Partial closure of the wound	Rates of pain	12286	12448	No statistically significant differences were found to be related to pain (p<0.06) at 48 hours and 7 days between the different suture techniques in group A and B
