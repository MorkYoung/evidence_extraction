Heroin	Placebo	Subjective feelings of sedation	14351	14543	Subjective feelings of rush (t(19)=9.570, P=0.0001), sedation (t(19)=2.111, P=0.049) and intoxication (t(19)=4.040, P=0.0008) were significantly higher after heroin than placebo administration
Heroin	Placebo	Subjective feelings of rush 	1224	1480	Relative to the placebo treatment in patients, heroin significantly increased rsFC of the left putamen within the basal ganglia/limbic network, the extent of which correlated positively with patients' feelings of rush and with the plasma level of morphine.
