acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP	1348	1463	The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the <NEWLINE>exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP.
14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1)	acute supplementation of Q10	overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses	-1	-1	Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters.
acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP	1348	1677	The acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation attenuated only the <NEWLINE>exercise-induced increase in response of the plasma CRP. The short-term (14-day) coenzyme Q10 <NEWLINE>supplementation attenuated the exercise-induced increase in response of the lactate, serum interleukin- <NEWLINE>6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CRP in male middle-distance runners.
coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	levels of serum CK	1687	1844	the acute <NEWLINE>and short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation had not any significant effect on the exerciseinduced <NEWLINE>increase response of total serum creatine kinase.
coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	levels of serum CK	10351	10515	levels of serum CK in CoQ10 group was significantly increased following the short-term supplementation and running 3000 meters like-competitive (Table 2) (p=0.073).
coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	inflammatory markers	10221	10337	In other word, compared with the placebo group, inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the group of CoQ10.
1acute coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	variables changes ranges after exercise protocol	9895	10004	Acute supplementation had no significant effect on variables changes ranges after exercise protocol (p>0.05).
14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1)	acute supplementation of Q10	overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses	-1	-1	Based on the present results, it can be concluded that the 14-day coenzyme Q10 supplementation (5mg.kg-1.day-1) is more effective than the acute supplementation to overcome the exercise-induced adverse responses in some oxidative, inflammatory and biochemical parameters. Therefore, short-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation is recommended to reduce exercise-induced adverse consequences.
coenzyme Q10 supplementation 	placebo	inflammatory markers	10236	10337	compared with the placebo group, inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the group of CoQ10.
