pramipexole (PX)	quetiapine (QT)	CBF	-1	-1	No CBF increases were detected when comparing QT with PX at P<.001 or P<.005.
quetiapine (dopamine receptor antagonist)	placebo	level of perfusion left middle and right superior prefrontal cortex and left caudate nucleus and at the border of left posterior part of the putamen and insular cortex	-1	-1	QT increased perfusion relative to placebo in the left middle and right superior prefrontal cortex and left caudate nucleus and at the border of left posterior part of the putamen and insular cortex (4% CBF change).
pramipexole (PX)	placebo	CBF in the bilateral caudate nuclei, left brainstem (including substantia nigra), and the left SMA and middle frontal gyrus	-1	-1	PX increased CBF relative to placebo in the bilateral caudate nuclei, left brainstem (including substantia nigra, 7% CBF change), and the left SMA and middle frontal gyrus (BA 11) if global CBF was included in the GLM.
quetiapine (QT)	placebo	cerebral blood flow (CBF) bilateral visual cortex, but also in the bilateral cerebellum	-1	-1	QT reduced CBF relative to placebo, particularly pronounced in the bilateral visual cortex (19.05% CBF change), but also in the bilateral cerebellum (Crus 2) with a right hemispheric dominance.
quetiapine (QT)	placebo	perfusion of the left middle and right superior prefrontal cortex and left caudate nucleus and at the border of left posterior part of the putamen and insular cortex	-1	-1	QT increased perfusion relative to placebo in the left middle and right superior prefrontal cortex and left caudate nucleus and at the border of left posterior part of the putamen and insular cortex (4% CBF change).
quetiapine (dopamine receptor antagonist)	placebo	level of perfusion left middle and right superior prefrontal cortex and left caudate nucleus and at the border of left posterior part of the putamen and insular cortex	25463	25587	). Some of these increases were significant: QT vs placebo (left caudate nucleus: P=.01, t=2.67; left putamen: P=.02, t=2.4)
pramipexole (PX)	quetiapine (QT)	CBF in the left cerebellum and brainstem (including substantia nigra) and right hypothalamus	-1	-1	PX showed elevated CBF compared with QT in the left cerebellum and brainstem (including substantia nigra, 8% CBF change) and right hypothalamus.
pramipexole (PX)	placebo	global CBF	-1	-1	If global CBF was included as confounding variable in the analysis, we found further decreases in CBF in the left fusiform gyrus, right cuneus, and superior temporal gyrus (global CBF was not significantly different between the treatments, all P>.5).
pramipexole (PX) (dopamine agonist of the nonergoline class) 	placebo	cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the right cerebellum, thalamus, and fusiform cortex	-1	-1	PX reduced CBF in the right cerebellum, thalamus, and fusiform cortex relative to placebo.
