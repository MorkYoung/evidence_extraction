group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	half carcasses	1218	1459	A comparison of half carcasses across the groups has shown no difference between the control group and the one with supplements, while the weight of half carcasses in the grazing group was smaller in comparison with groups C and S (p<0.001).
group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	fat content	10574	10828	The lack of differences in meat content of the pelvic limb between the groups, and, at the same time, the lower fat content (p<0.001) in group G, plus the better parameters of pelvic limb tightness in groups C and S, are evidence of their higher fatness.
group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	The fat of pelvic limb 	899	943	The lambs from group G were grazed every day
G, outdoor with no supplement	baseline	internal fat depot - kidney with pelvic fat	11721	11977	Grazing had a lesser effect on internal fat depot (kidney with pelvic fat; p<0.05) than on intermuscular (p<0.001) and on subcutaneous (p<0.001) fat, in keeping with the findings of other authors (Kuźnicka, 2006; Joy et al., 2008; Carrasco et al., 2009b).
group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	the weight of half carcasses	1218	1459	A comparison of half carcasses across the groups has shown no difference between the control group and the one with supplements, while the weight of half carcasses in the grazing group was smaller in comparison with groups C and S (p<0.001).
G, outdoor with no supplement	baseline	internal fat depot - intermuscular and on subcutaneous fat	11721	11916	Grazing had a lesser effect on internal fat depot (kidney with pelvic fat; p<0.05) than on intermuscular (p<0.001) and on subcutaneous (p<0.001) fat, in keeping with the findings of other authors
S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement, group C, indoor with no supplement; 	The concentrations of Se and Zn in the blood plasma of ram-lambs	1660	1818	The concentrations of Se and Zn in the blood plasma of ram-lambs from the supplemented group were significantly higher than for the control and grazing lambs.
group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	half carcasses	1218	1346	A comparison of half carcasses across the groups has shown no difference between the control group and the one with supplements,
group C, indoor with no supplement; S, indoor with supplement,	G, outdoor with no supplement	The fat of pelvic limb 	1549	1659	The pelvic limb of grazing lambs contained less fat compared to the control and supplemented groups (p<0.001).
