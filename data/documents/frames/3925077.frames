low dose penicillin V	placebo	probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from a societal perspective	1576	1725	probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from an NHS perspective, rising to 76% probability from a secondary, societal perspective.
low dose penicillin V	placebo	Cost of Prophylactic Antibiotics to Prevent Cellulitis of the Leg	1370	1497	Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant, comparing the two groups
low dose penicillin V	placebo	probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from a societal perspective	19493	19670	If a break-even (no-investment) criterion is required then prophylaxis is 62% likely to be cost-effective from an NHS perspective and 73% from a secondary, societal perspective.
low dose penicillin V	placebo	reduction in the number of recurrences while on prophylaxis	20859	21028	There was a more dramatic 45% reduction in the number of recurrences while on prophylaxis (incident rate ratio, IRR: 0.55 95%CI: 0.37 to 0.80), p = 0.002 (see Figure 1).
low dose penicillin V	placebo	reduction in the number of recurrences while on prophylaxis	21523	21722	Antibiotic prophylaxis substantially reduced the number of recurrences experienced by patients while on treatment although there was no evidence of a persisting protective effect when therapy ceased.
low dose penicillin V	placebo	probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from an NHS perspective	19047	19299	. If a decision-maker is willing to pay up to £25,000/QALY (shown as a dashed line, the middle of the range £20–30K/QALY used in England by NICE as assess value for money [24]), then there is a 66% probability of this being true from an NHS perspective
