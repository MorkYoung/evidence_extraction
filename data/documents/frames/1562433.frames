knee extension at 90° of flexion	hip abduction at 0° and 30°	vastus lateralis obliquus (VLO) EMG activity	-1	-1	Significantly higher VLO activity for male subjects was observed in MVIC knee extension at 90° of flexion compared with MVIC hip abduction at 0° and 30° of abduction and for female subjects performing MVIC knee extension at 90° of flexion when compared with MVIC hip abduction at 0° and 30° of abduction.
knee extension at 90° of flexion	hip abduction at 0° and 30°	vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) EMG activity 	-1	-1	Significantly higher VMO activity for both male and female subjects performing MVIC knee extension at 90° of flexion when compared to MVIC hip abduction at 0° and 30° of abduction.
knee extension at 90° of flexion	hip abduction at 0° and 30°	vastus lateralis longus (VLL) EMG activity	-1	-1	VLL EMG activity without significant differences among the three exercises tested.
