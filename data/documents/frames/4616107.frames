Active myofascial trigger point group, or Latent myofascial trigger point group	Control group	Maximum voluntary isometric contraction or endurance	910	995	No <NEWLINE>significant differences in MVIC or endurance were revealed among the three groups.
Active myofascial trigger point group	Control group	Median frequency (MDF), and muscle fatigue index	-1	-1	the active trigger point group had significantly different MDF and muscle fatigue index compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Given that muscles with active myofascial trigger points had an increased MDF and suffered muscle fatigue more easily, increased recruitment of motor unit action potential of type II fibers was evident.
