Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Hospitalization duration	1118	1219	the mean hospitalization duration was 34% shorter in the active than in the control group (P < 0.001)
Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Treatment-related MAE	867	1100	At least one treatment-related MAE was observed in 9.2% of patients (n = 17) assigned to the active group vs. 13.3% of patients (n = 26) in the control group (P = 0.21), a 4.1% absolute risk reduction (95% CI −2.2 to 10.4; P = 0.98).
Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Treatment-related MAE	867	1035	At least one treatment-related MAE was observed in 9.2% of patients (n = 17) assigned to the active group vs. 13.3% of patients (n = 26) in the control group (P = 0.21)
Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Proportions of NMAE relative to all AE	-1	-1	Conversely, the proportions of NMAE relative to all AE were 55% (22/40) in the active group, vs. 32% (12/38) in the control group (P = 0.04). The cumulative incidence of MAE and NMAE in each study group is shown in Figure 2.Table 3
Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Proportions of NMAE relative to all AE	16017	16158	Conversely, the proportions of NMAE relative to all AE were 55% (22/40) in the active group, vs. 32% (12/38) in the control group (P = 0.04).
Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement	Usual medical practices	Having at least 1 treatment-related adverse event	14650	14928	By the end of the trial, the proportion of patients with at least one treatment-related AE was 19.5% (n = 74) in the overall population (95% CI 15.5–23.5), 20.1% (n = 37) in the active group, and 19.0% (n = 37) in the control group (absolute RR 1.1%; 95% CI −6.9 to 9.1; P=0.78)
