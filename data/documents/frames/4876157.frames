0.2% lidocaine in a one-per-mil solution	2 % lidocaine	Onset of action speed	1247	1440	The OOA of 0.2% lidocaine in a one-per-mil tumescent solution is statistically shorter than 2% plain lidocaine (P=0.04); while its DOA is statistically longer than 2% plain lidocaine (P<0.001).
0.2% lidocaine in a one-per-mil solution	2 % lidocaine	Duration of action	1247	1440	The OOA of 0.2% lidocaine in a one-per-mil tumescent solution is statistically shorter than 2% plain lidocaine (P=0.04); while its DOA is statistically longer than 2% plain lidocaine (P<0.001).
0.2% lidocaine in a one-per-mil solution	2 % lidocaine	Duration of action	11319	11540	As shown in Table 3, the DOA of the 2% lidocaine group (99.67±31.34) was shorter than the DOA of the one-per-mil tumescent solution group (186.83±44.02). This difference was found to be statistically significant (P<0.001;
