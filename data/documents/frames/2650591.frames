Respimat® Soft MistTM	Pressurized metered-dose inhalers	Lung deposition in untrained patients 	687	1114	Deposition was measured by gamma scintigraphy. All 13 patients entered (9 males, mean age 62 years; FEV1 46% of predicted) inhaled too fast at screening (peak inspiratory flow rate [IF]: 69–161 L/min). Whole lung deposition was higher with Respimat® SMI than with pMDI for untrained (37% of delivered dose vs 21% of metered dose) and trained patients (53% of delivered vs 21% of metered dose) (pSign-Test].15; pANOVA < = 0.05).
