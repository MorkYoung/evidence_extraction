Results of the post-hoc test showed that the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group had the lowest CK level (Table 2Table 2.
pre-exercise vibration stimulation	post-exercise vibration stimulation 	reduce muscle damage.	1403	1692	Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is caused by eccentric contraction or excessive <NEWLINE>overload, which requires large changes in muscle length1). EIMD secretes the intracellular proteins of muscle cells such as <NEWLINE>creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myoglobin into the blood
