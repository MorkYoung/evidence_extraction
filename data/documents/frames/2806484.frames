Home-based HIV-care strategy	Facility-based HIV-care strategy	Costs for the health service	29097	29307	The home-based strategy did not result in higher costs for the health service. Moreover, home-based care was slightly cheaper than facility-based care by about $45 per patient per year, or 6% of the total cost.
Home-based HIV-care strategy	Facility-based HIV-care strategy	Admission diagnoses	25499	26017	Admission diagnoses were similar in both groups (table 3). 20 (13%) patients who were admitted died (15 on home and five on facility care) and eight (5%) worsened and requested discharge (six on home and two on facility care)—seven died subsequently. Table 4 shows frequency of outpatient attendance at clinic, number of presentations in which a new diagnosis was made, and new diagnoses by number and type. Distribution of diagnoses was similar between groups and more than half were infectious and parasitic disease.
Home-based HIV-care strategy	Facility-based HIV-care strategy	Virological failure	24349	24477	Rates of detection of plasma viral loads of more than 500 copies per mL after a 6-month visit were much the same in both groups.
Home-based HIV-care strategy	Facility-based HIV-care strategy	Increase in CD4-cell counts	26019	26573	CD4-cell counts increased rapidly in both groups (figure 3). 748 (87%) participants in home care and 521 (88%) in facility care were tested for CD4-cell count at least once after starting treatment, with median intervals between baseline and final tests of 32 months (IQR 25–39) for home and 29 months (23–35) for facility. 608 (81%) in home and 419 (80%) in facility had CD4-cell counts of greater than 200 cells per μL at the final visit. Counts at this visit were lower than baseline in 32 (4%) of those in home compared with 29 (6%) in facility care.

Home-based HIV-care strategy	Facility-based HIV-care strategy	Mortality rates	24996	25321	Mortality rates were much the same in the two groups during the study (figure 2). Combined mortality rates per 100 person-years were 16·47 (95% CI 13·69–19·82) during the first 5 months after treatment started, 6·69 (4·94–9·05) for 6–11 months, 2·71 (1·92–3·84) for 12–23 months, and 0·97 (0·54–1·76) for 24 months and after.
