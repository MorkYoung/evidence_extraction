0	67	chemoimmunotherapy	bevacizumab	hypertension	The addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy was found to be safe, with no significant differences in severe adverse events between the 2 arms, other than an increase in non-fatal cardiovascular complications (33% vs 3%, p<0.003); none of the 7 cases of hypertension presented as an hypertensive emergency, and they all resolved with non-urgent medical management; the 2 cases of CHF and the 1 case of myocarditis all occurred in patients with pre-existing heart dysfunction who had discontinued their home medications, and resolved with non-urgent medical management; the only grade 4 cardiovascular complication was a torsade de pointe, which occurred as a peri-surgical complication in a patient with pre-existing aortic aneurysm, developing an aortic dissection requiring surgical intervention.
