honey mitigates	povidone-iodine	signs of grade 1 mucositis at the end of the first week	10388	10525	At the end of the first week, 84% of the patients in the control and 24% in the honey group showed signs of grade 1 mucositis (p < 0.05).
honey mitigates	povidone-iodine	The incidence of intolerable mucositis (only grade 3) at the end of week 7 	10697	10936	The incidence of intolerable mucositis (only grade 3) were seen earlier and at the end of week 3 in controls (16% (4/24), p = 0.03) and reached a peak in both the groups at the end of week 7 (12/24 in controls vs. 8/25 in honey (p = 0.2)).
honey mitigates	povidone-iodine	weight loss	11587	11786	Additionally, it was observed that when compared to the povidone-iodine (4.86 ± 1.73) group, the weight loss was less in the honey cohorts (2.77 ± 0.85) and was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
honey mitigates	povidone-iodine	The onset of tolerable and intolerable mucositis 	10087	10238	The onset of tolerable and intolerable mucositis was delayed in the patients using honey and was significant for week 2 (p < 0.0001) and 3 (p < 0.003).
honey mitigates	povidone-iodine	the incidence of grade 2 mucositis at week 2	10526	10696	With continuation of the treatment, the incidence of grade 2 mucositis appeared only in the controls (32% (8/25) vs. 0% (0/25)) and was significant (p = 0.002) at week 2.
