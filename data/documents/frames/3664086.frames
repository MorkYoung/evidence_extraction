neoadjuvant DE (docetaxel: 75 mg/m2, d1, epirubicin: 75 mg/m2, d1, every 3 weeks)	neoadjuvant DE combined with rh-endostatin (7.5 mg/m2, d1-d14, every 3 weeks)	quality of life score and side effects	1720	1814	No significant difference was identified in quality of life score and side effects (P > 0.05).
neoadjuvant DE (docetaxel: 75 mg/m2, d1, epirubicin: 75 mg/m2, d1, every 3 weeks)	neoadjuvant DE combined with rh-endostatin (7.5 mg/m2, d1-d14, every 3 weeks)	effectiveness in premenopausal patients and patients with ECOG score of zero	23733	23967	Stratification analysis revealed that premenopausal patients and patients with ECOG sore of zero had higher ORR, indicating that premenopausal women with good performance status may benefit more from rh-endostatin combination therapy.
