extracts of fennelin	placebo	severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea	1059	1397	There was no significant difference in the mean of severity of dysmenorrhea during one cycle before the intervention between the four groups, but the difference was significant during two cycles after the intervention. Fennelin had similar effects as vitagnus on dysmenorrhea. Mefenamic acid had less effect than both the drugs (P <0.05).

extracts of vitagnus	placebo	severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea	8489	9214	In this study, the pain intensity before treatment with herbal oral drops and mefenamic acid capsules and placebo drops in one cycle (zero cycle) was studied. Average pain intensity in the three groups was not significantly different at the end of the zero cycle; but at the end of the first and second cycles of the intervention (drugs), this difference was significant. The study results showed that both drugs were able to reduce pain during treatment. The effects of the two herbal drugs were the same but higher than that of mefenamic acid. The average pain intensity in both herbal drug groups was reduced not only at the end of the first prescription medication but also at the end of the second month after treatment.
