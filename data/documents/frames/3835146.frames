atacicept (single dose: 3, 9 or 18 mg/kg; or multiple dose: 2 × 9 mg/kg)	placebo	mature and total B-cells	23503	23859	Atacicept induced an initial transient increase followed by a dose-dependent reduction in mature and total B-cells (Figure 4A and B). The greatest reductions were seen in mature B-cells 6 weeks after a single dose in the 9 mg/kg group (40% reduction from baseline) and 7 weeks after the repeated dose in the 2 × 9 mg/kg group (55% reduction from baseline).
atacicept (single dose: 3, 9 or 18 mg/kg; or multiple dose: 2 × 9 mg/kg)	placebo	Ig levels	24226	24523	Ig levels decreased rapidly after atacicept dosing, with the greatest reductions seen for IgM (Figure 4C and D). The largest effect was seen in the 2 × 9mg/kg group, which showed a median decrease frombaseline of ∼40% for IgM 6 weeks after the last dose (33% decrease in IgA, 20% decrease in IgG).
atacicept (single dose: 3, 9 or 18 mg/kg; or multiple dose: 2 × 9 mg/kg)	placebo	C3 levels	24812	25191	C3 levels remained within the normal range throughout the study for most patients. At baseline, only three of 24 patients had C3 values below the normal range (0.9–1.8 g/L): one patient in the 9 mg/kg group, one patient in the 18 mg kg group and one patient in the 2 × 9 mg/kg group. All three of these patients showed transient increases in C3 to normal levels during treatment.
