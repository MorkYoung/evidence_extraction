Medication plus exercise	Medication only	Improvement in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at 24 weeks	5676	5969	The medication-plus-exercise group showed a greater improvement in HRSD scores (change in score from baseline) than the medication-only group from the first follow-up, at 6 weeks, and this difference became statistically significant at weeks 12 (P = 0.04, t = 2.10) and 24 (P = 0.02, t = 2.42)
Medication plus exercise	Medication only	Relapse rates	7229	7696	Relapse rates were also recorded via subjective reports and as a measured increase of >50% from baseline HRSD scores (Neumeister et al, 1997). In total, nine patients relapsed, two from the medication-plus-exercise group (both in week 18) and seven from the medication-only group (one relapse in week 6, two in week 12 and four in week 24). This difference in relapse rates did not reach significance (Fisher's exact test: one-tailed, P = 0.07; two-tailed, P = 0.14).
