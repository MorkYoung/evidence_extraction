Decremental PEEP titration group	table-based PEEP (control) group	The survival rate / overall mortality of patients with ARDS	16704	17050	The overall mortality at 28 days was 37%. Mortality at 28 days was 33% in the control group and 40% in the decremental PEEP titration group (Table 2). Using Cox regression for 28-day mortality, the survival rate in the decremental PEEP titration group was not different (p = 0.725; hazard ratio = 1.168; 95% confidence interval = 0.493 to 2.768).
