experimental group was supplemented with 500 mg of SAA per kg of body mass, dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink®;	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	swimming velocity	1106	1340	An analysis of a lactate profile as a function of a maximal <NEWLINE>swimming velocity exposed a statistically significant positive shift in the <NEWLINE>swimming velocity of 0.05 m/s, at the lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L in the <NEWLINE>experimental group.
experimental group was supplemented with 500 mg of SAA per kg of body mass, dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink®;	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	serum lactic acid concentration	902	1104	the change in the serum <NEWLINE>lactic acid concentration observed in the experimental group was sevenfold less <NEWLINE>than in the control group [21.8 vs. -3.7 L% for the control and experimental <NEWLINE>groups, respectively]
experimental group was supplemented with 500 mg of SAA per kg of body mass, dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink®;	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	swimming velocity	1194	1340	statistically significant positive shift in the <NEWLINE>swimming velocity of 0.05 m/s, at the lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L in the <NEWLINE>experimental group.
Intervention	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	Corticosterone concentration	10791	10916	Corticosterone concentration decreased in the control group (−2.0 %L) <NEWLINE>while in the experimental group, it increased (10.9 L%)
Intervention	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	Corticosterone concentration	10791	10917	Corticosterone concentration decreased in the control group (−2.0 %L) <NEWLINE>while in the experimental group, it increased (10.9 L%).
experimental group was supplemented with 500 mg of SAA per kg of body mass, dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink®;	control group with Carborade Drink® alone	serum testosterone levels	1341	1480	There was also a positive, although statistically <NEWLINE>insignificant, increase of 2.6 L% in serum testosterone levels in the experimental <NEWLINE>group.
