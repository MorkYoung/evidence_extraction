exemestane 25 mg	baseline	Ki-67 mitotic index	19587	19711	The reduction in Ki-67 in both EXE–COXIB and EXE arms was significant for both treatments (P<0.002 and P<0.02, respectively)
exemestane 25 mg day−1±celecoxib 800 mg day−1	exemestane 25 mg	Ki-67 mitotic index	1307	1485	A statistically significant reduction of Ki-67 expression after treatment with exemestane±celecoxib was observed (P<0.02) with greater reduction in the combination arm (P<0.004).
exemestane 25 mg day−1±celecoxib 800 mg day−1	baseline	Ki-67 mitotic index	1307	1485	A statistically significant reduction of Ki-67 expression after treatment with exemestane±celecoxib was observed (P<0.02) with greater reduction in the combination arm (P<0.004).
exemestane 25 mg	baseline	COX-2 expression	20079	20294	There was a significant reduction in COX-2 expression in the EXE–COXIB arm (P<0.03) at definitive surgery compared with the initial biopsy, but no significant difference was observed between biopsies in the EXE arm.
exemestane 25 mg day−1±celecoxib 800 mg day−1	baseline	COX-2 expression	20079	20294	There was a significant reduction in COX-2 expression in the EXE–COXIB arm (P<0.03) at definitive surgery compared with the initial biopsy, but no significant difference was observed between biopsies in the EXE arm.
exemestane 25 mg day−1±celecoxib 800 mg day−1	baseline	COX-2 expression	1486	1608	Concomitant reduction in COX-2 expression was statistically significant in the exemestane and celecoxib arm (P<0.03) only.
exemestane 25 mg day−1±celecoxib 800 mg day−1	baseline	Ki-67 mitotic index	19162	19253	In the EXE–COXIB arm, all patients showed a reduction of Ki-67 after treatment (Figure 4A).
exemestane 25 mg	baseline	Ki-67 mitotic index	18856	19065	The median Ki-67 mitotic index fell from 12.5% (range, 6–23%) at initial biopsy to 4% (range, 1–8%) at definitive surgery in the EXE-COXIB arm and from 12% (range, 4–24%) to 7.5% (range, 1–18%) in the EXE arm.
