five injections of HA1 (Suprahyal®/Adant®)	standard care (control)	At early follow-up (3 months), total WOMAC scores Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)	16640	16864	At early follow-up (3 months), total WOMAC scores improved as compared to baseline, in all groups with reductions of 44.79% (HA1), 24.0% (HA2), 40.38% (HA3), 39.77% (PRP), and 27.64% (control), (p=0.002 HA1 compared to HA2).
five injections of HA1 (Suprahyal®/Adant®)	standard care (control)	At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC	1326	1576	At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC was in HA1 with a 65.20% reduction, followed by PRP (55.01%), HA3 (49.57%), and HA2 (29.82%), whereas the control group had a 14.55% increase over baseline (p=0.001 control compared to HA1 and HA3).
four injections of HA2 (Orthovisc®)	standard care (control)	At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC	16866	17248	At 18 months, a higher improvement in total WOMAC was observed in HA1 with a 65.20% reduction, followed by PRP (55.01%), HA3 (49.57%), and HA2 (29.82%), whereas the control group had a 14.5% increase over baseline despite the use of rescue medication and rehabilitation, with the differences statistically significant with respect to HA1 and HA3 (p=0.001; Table 3 and Figures 2A–D).
three injections of HA3 (Synvisc®)	standard care (control)	At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC	1326	1576	At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC was in HA1 with a 65.20% reduction, followed by PRP (55.01%), HA3 (49.57%), and HA2 (29.82%), whereas the control group had a 14.55% increase over baseline (p=0.001 control compared to HA1 and HA3).
1) five injections of HA1 (Suprahyal®/Adant®); 2) four injections of HA2 (Orthovisc®); 3) three injections of HA3 (Synvisc®); 4) a single injection of PRP (GPSTM II);	standard care (control)	The percentage of patients achieving the MCII for both pain and function at 18 months	17456	17875	At the end of follow-up, a growing number of patients experienced a clinically significant improvement in HA1 with a 100% responders rate, followed by HA3 (80%). In the group treated with HA2 and in those treated with PRP, the results reached 60% responders, whereas in the control group, all patients returned to near pre-arthroscopy levels of pain and impairment and none of the patients reached the 20% MCII cutoff (
