0	12	zinc and selenium supplementation	rosuvastatin	lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity	The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin.
1	25	zinc and selenium supplementation	rosuvastatin	lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity	The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin.
5	141	rosuvastatin + placebo	rosuvastatin + mineral supplemented	hepatic enzymes activities	Either rosuvastatin + placebo treatment or rosuvastatin + mineral supplemented did not change hepatic enzymes activities (P > 0.41) (Table 2).
12	182	Rosuvastatin therapy	mineral supplementation	LDL (-) levels .	Rosuvastatin therapy alone or associated with mineral supplementation did not affect the LDL(-) levels.
13	222	zinc and selenium	rosuvastatin	lipid profile or SOD and GPx activities	Further, the zinc and selenium doses used here did not act synergistically or additively with rosuvastatin to modify the lipid profile or SOD and GPx activities of patients with stable angina.
