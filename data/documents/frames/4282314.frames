Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Weight loss at 12 weeks	14974	15047	and at week 12 to 2.31% [−6.55% (0.52%) versus −4.23% (0.66%); P = 0.007]
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Weight loss at 4 weeks	14801	14887	At 4 weeks, the difference was 1.64% [−4.01% (0.28%) versus −2.37% (0.37%); P < 0.001]
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	>5% weight loss	14341	14538	In total, 61% of the meal provision arm compared to 22% of the self-directed arm achieved clinically significant >5% loss of body weight calculated using an intention-to-treat analysis (P < 0.001).
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Impact of Weight on Quality of Life	15486	15819	There were no differences between groups between baseline and 12 weeks; however, weight-related quality of life (IWQoL-lite), mental toughness (MTQ48) and the 100-point health state scale from EQ-5D all improved in participants completing the studies, although these changes did not significantly correlate with weight loss (Table2).
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Attrition 	1194	1374	Attrition was less apparent with 7% of those participants receiving meal provision withdrawing from the study compared to 41% of those following the self-directed diet (P < 0.001).
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Weight loss at 4 weeks	14540	14888	A significant difference in percentage weight were seen at all time points between the meal provision and the self-directed arms, which is supported by the significant effect of intervention and time by the two-way mixed model analysis of variance (P = 0.046). At 4 weeks, the difference was 1.64% [−4.01% (0.28%) versus −2.37% (0.37%); P < 0.001],
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	>5% weight loss	959	1135	In terms of clinically relevant weight loss, 61% of participants lost 5% or more of their body weight with meal provision compared to 22% on the self-directed diet (P < 0.001).
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Health state (EQ-5D) 	15486	15819	There were no differences between groups between baseline and 12 weeks; however, weight-related quality of life (IWQoL-lite), mental toughness (MTQ48) and the 100-point health state scale from EQ-5D all improved in participants completing the studies, although these changes did not significantly correlate with weight loss (Table2).
Meal provision	Self-directed diet	Weight loss at 12 weeks	805	1135	At 12 weeks [mean (SEM)], percentage weight loss in the meal provision group was 6.6% (0.5%) compared to 4.3% (0.6%) for those on the self-directed diet. In terms of clinically relevant weight loss, 61% of participants lost 5% or more of their body weight with meal provision compared to 22% on the self-directed diet (P < 0.001).
