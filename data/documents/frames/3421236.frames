Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Beck depression inventory-II	20616	20708	There was no difference in BDI-II change between the two groups (F = 1.1; df = 1; p = 0.38).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression	19112	19204	There was no difference in HRSD change between the two groups (F = 0.063; df = 1; p = 0.80).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression	19112	19202	There was no difference in HRSD change between the two groups (F = 0.063; df = 1; p = 0.80
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale	20129	20443	There was no difference in MADRS change between the two groups (F = 0.38; df = 1; p = 0.55). One of the subjects in the active tDCS group achieved response (Fisher's exact p = 1.00) and remission criteria (Fisher's exact p = 1.00) while no subjects met response or remission criteria in the sham stimulation group.
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Serious adverse events	21615	21672	No serious adverse events were reported during the trial.
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Beck depression inventory-II	20515	20708	The mean post-BDI-II score in the active tDCS group and sham stimulation group are shown in Table 2. There was no difference in BDI-II change between the two groups (F = 1.1; df = 1; p = 0.38).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale	20129	20220	There was no difference in MADRS change between the two groups (F = 0.38; df = 1; p = 0.55)
