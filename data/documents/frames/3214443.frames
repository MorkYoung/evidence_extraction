Physical Exercise (NG II)-brisk walking for 50 to 60 minutes, three to four days/week;	Yoga (NG IV) for 30 to 45 minutes/day, five days/week	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP	13667	13859	Similarly, on comparing the mean reduction in the SBP and DBP of the physical exercise group with the yoga group, the physical exercise group showed a significantly higher reduction (P<0.001).
Physical Exercise (NG II)-brisk walking for 50 to 60 minutes, three to four days/week, Salt Intake Reduction (NG III) to at least half of their previous intake, Yoga (NG IV) for 30 to 45 minutes/day, five days/week	Control (New Group I)	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP	1330	1541	All three intervention groups showed significant reduction in BP (SBP/DBP mmHg: 5.3/6.0 in NG II, 2.5/2.0 in NG III, and 2.3/2.4 in NG IV, respectively), while the Control Group showed no significant difference.
Physical Exercise (NG II)-brisk walking for 50 to 60 minutes, three to four days/week;	Salt Intake Reduction (NG III) to at least half of their previous intake;	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP	13255	13666	In the per protocol population, that is, the 94 subjects who had successfully completed the interventions in the groups assigned to them and in the Intention-to-Intervene population of all 98 subjects, who were initially enrolled and randomized, the mean reduction in the SBP and DBP values of the physical exercise group when compared with those of the salt reduction group, was significantly higher (P<0.001).
Physical Exercise (NG II)-brisk walking for 50 to 60 minutes, three to four days/week, Salt Intake Reduction (NG III) to at least half of their previous intake, Yoga (NG IV) for 30 to 45 minutes/day, five days/week	Control (New Group I)	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP	12331	12663	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP when the pre-intervention values were compared with the modified post-intervention values in each of the three intervention groups, continued to be statistical significant (P<0.05 in each case), even after the adjustment for baseline reduction in the Control Group [Table 2].
Salt Intake Reduction (NG III) to at least half of their previous intake,	Yoga (NG IV) for 30 to 45 minutes/day, five days/week	The mean difference in the reduction of both SBP and DBP	13953	14236	However, when the effectiveness of restricted salt intake and yoga on the reduction of BP were compared, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) between the two interventions. Hence, it was deduced that restricted salt intake and yoga practices were equally effective [Table 3].
