Kegel exercises program	Control	FEV1/Forced vital capacity 	8259	8404	For FEV1/FVC, the test <NEWLINE>group showed an increase and the control group exhibited a decrease, but these changes were <NEWLINE>not statistically significant.
Kegel exercises program	Control	Maximum Voluntary Ventilation	715	954	Kegel exercises performed in the experimental group significantly <NEWLINE>improved forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, PER, FEF 25–75%, IC, <NEWLINE>and maximum voluntary ventilation compared to no improvement in the control group.
Kegel exercises program	Control	Maximum Voluntary Ventilation	8523	8669	For MVV, the test group <NEWLINE>showed an increase and the control group exhibited a decrease. These differences were <NEWLINE>statistically significant (p < 0.05)
Kegel exercises program	Control	Forced vital capacity 	8056	8258	The test group showed increases in FVC (p < 0.05), FEV1 (p < <NEWLINE>0.05), and PEF (p < 0.05), whereas the control group exhibited decreases in the same <NEWLINE>variables. These results were statistically significant.
