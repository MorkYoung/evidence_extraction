Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Adequate blood pressure control	19601	19800	After three months' intervention, PP analysis revealed that 8.8% in regular salt group and 19.2% in salt-substitute group had had their blood pressure well controlled (SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg), (p<0.05).
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Adequate blood pressure control	1408	1691	. Furthermore, the whole distribution of blood pressure showed an overall decline in SBP/DBP and the proportion of patients with BP under control (SBP/DBP<140 mmHg) was significantly higher in salt-substitute group in comparison to the regular salt group (19.2% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.027).
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Diastolic blood pressure 	1067	1233	After the three months' intervention period, the net reduction in SBP/DBP in the intervention group in comparison to the control group was −8.2/−3.4 mmHg (all p<0.05)
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Diastolic blood pressure 	1067	1409	After the three months' intervention period, the net reduction in SBP/DBP in the intervention group in comparison to the control group was −8.2/−3.4 mmHg (all p<0.05) in PP analysis, after adjusting for baseline BP and other variables. ITT analysis showed the net reduction in SBP/DBP at −7.6/−3.5 mmHg with multiple imputations (all p<0.05).
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Systolic blood pressure 	1067	1233	After the three months' intervention period, the net reduction in SBP/DBP in the intervention group in comparison to the control group was −8.2/−3.4 mmHg (all p<0.05)
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Estimated average daily sodium chloride intake	21543	21702	The estimated average daily sodium chloride intake was 20.0±5.4 grams in the salt substitute group versus 26.9±8.1 grams in the regular salt group (p = 0.025).
Low-Sodium, High-Potassium Salt Substitute	Control	Estimated average daily sodium chloride intake	21543	21701	The estimated average daily sodium chloride intake was 20.0±5.4 grams in the salt substitute group versus 26.9±8.1 grams in the regular salt group (p = 0.025)
