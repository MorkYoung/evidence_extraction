Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia	21699	21829	rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia were low in both treatment groups (higher with IDeg but not statistically significant).
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Adverse events	1735	1917	Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was infrequent in both groups, with no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, and no marked differences in adverse events with either treatment approach.
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia	1735	1917	Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was infrequent in both groups, with no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, and no marked differences in adverse events with either treatment approach.
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Change in levels of glycated haemoglobin after 26 weeks	-1	-1	At 26 weeks, the mean change in glycated haemoglobin level was greater in the IDeg addâ€?on to liraglutide arm (âˆ'1.04%) than in the placebo addâ€?on to liraglutide arm (âˆ'0.16%; p < 0.0001)
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Overall confirmed hypoglycaemia	-1	-1	Confirmed hypoglycaemia rates were low in both groups, although higher with IDeg than with placebo (0.57 vs. 0.12 episodes/patientâ€?years of exposure; p = 0.0002).
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Adverse events	25435	25684	In the present study, there were no confirmed cases of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Other AEs reported in this study were as expected considering the component drugs of the regimen, and patterns of AEs were similar in the two treatment groups.
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Mean fasting plasma glucose at 26 weeks	-1	-1	the mean fasting plasma glucose reduction was greater, and selfâ€?measured plasma glucose values were lower at all eight time points, with IDeg addâ€?on versus placebo addâ€?on (both p < 0.0001).
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Mean fasting plasma glucose at 26 weeks	928	1314	At 26 weeks, the mean change in glycated haemoglobin level was greater in the IDeg add‐on to liraglutide arm (−1.04%) than in the placebo add‐on to liraglutide arm (−0.16%; p < 0.0001). Similarly, the mean fasting plasma glucose reduction was greater, and self‐measured plasma glucose values were lower at all eight time points, with IDeg add‐on versus placebo add‐on (both p < 0.0001).
Liraglutide and metformin plus insulin degludec (IDeg)	Liraglutide and metformin plus placebo	Overall confirmed hypoglycaemia	16840	17016	The number of patients experiencing confirmed hypoglycaemia during randomized treatment was higher with IDeg (17.3%) than with placebo (4.7%; Table S3, Supporting Information).
