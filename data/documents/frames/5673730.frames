oral metformin 500 mg TDS (Group-A)	insulin 0.8-0.9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses subcutaneously (Group-B)	glycemic control before and after the treatment	-1	-1	Results analyzed for glycemic control before and after the treatment revealed that FBS was statistically less in Group-A (p=0.00) whereas for Group-B the value of FBS and HbA1C was statistically high. (p=0.002 & 0.04 respectively).Conclusion:Metformin has produced better effects on feto-maternal outcomes and glycemic control in comparison to Insulin in GDM.
