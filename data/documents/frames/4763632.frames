Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Formation of new dot-globule 	10071	10201	new dot-globule formation was noted in all nevi (100%) exposed to PUVA compared to only 48.1% in the NB-UVB group (P value 0.0056)
All uncovered nevi	All covered nevi	Demoscopic changes	898	1041	Overall demoscopic changes were observed in 34/37 (91.8%) of the uncovered nevi compared to 16/37 (43.2%) of the covered nevi (P value 0.0001).
Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Formation of new dot-globule 	1339	1442	New dot/globule formation was observed more frequently in the covered and uncovered nevi of PUVA group.
Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Demoscopic changes	9760	9905	The prevalence of overall dermoscopic changes was significantly higher in the PUVA-exposed nevi (100% for PUVA, 88.8% for NB-UVB, P value 0.041).
Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Nevi hyperpigmentation	9906	10061	No differences were found between the effects of the two types of UV therapy regarding the frequency of enlarging nevi and the amount of hyperpigmentation.
Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Demoscopic changes	1183	1338	Compared to NB-UVB, dermoscopic changes were more frequent in both covered and uncovered nevi of the PUVA group. (P values 0.041 and 0.0172, respectively).
Psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA)	Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)	Frequency of nevi enlargement	9906	10061	No differences were found between the effects of the two types of UV therapy regarding the frequency of enlarging nevi and the amount of hyperpigmentation.
