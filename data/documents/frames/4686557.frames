Technetium-99m Tilmanocept	Filtered Technetium Sulfur Colloid	Pain at 4 mins	-1	-1	The final model with pain score predictions over the first 5 min postinjection is depicted in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the model found fTcSC resulted in significantly more pain of 15.2 mm (p < 0.001), 11.3 mm (p = 0.001), and 7.5 mm (p = 0.013) at 1, 2, and 3 min postinjection, respectively (Table 2). Differences at 4 and 5 min postinjection were not statistically significant.Fig. 3
