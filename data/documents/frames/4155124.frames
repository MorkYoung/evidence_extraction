healthy Nordic diet (ND)	baseline	plasma cathepsin S levels	989	1161	he ND significantly decreased cathepsin S levels (from 20.1 (+/-4.0 SD) to 19.7 μg/L (+/-4.3 SD)) compared with control group (from 18.2 (+/-2.9 SD) to 19.1 μg/L (+/-3.8 SD
healthy Nordic diet (ND)	baseline	insulin sensitivity	9730	9978	These differences remained after adjusting for sex (p = 0.03) and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03), whereas adjusting for weight change (P = 0.22), LDL-C (P = 0.36) and total cholesterol (P = 0.48) abolished the significant difference between groups.
