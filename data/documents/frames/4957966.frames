FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Biochemistry, O2 saturation, venous blood gas, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide	20923	21149	No statistically significant differences were found in venous acid base variables, electrolytes, oxygen saturations, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate, or BNP-NT values between the FAST and SLOW treatment regimes at any time point
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Pulse rate	19601	19745	Longitudinal analysis indicated that the pulse rate under the FAST treatment was significantly higher than under the SLOW treatment (P = 0.022).
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Oxygen delivery	16715	16828	No statistically significant changes in DO2 between the treatments over the duration of the study were identified
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Pressure-based haemodynamic variables	17493	17677	Longitudinal analysis showed that MAP, sBP, and dBP were all significantly higher under the FAST treatment compared with the SLOW treatment (P = 0.035; P = 0.046; P = 0.035) (Table 2).
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Pressure-based haemodynamic variables	17493	17666	Longitudinal analysis showed that MAP, sBP, and dBP were all significantly higher under the FAST treatment compared with the SLOW treatment (P = 0.035; P = 0.046; P = 0.035)
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Oxygen delivery	16715	16829	No statistically significant changes in DO2 between the treatments over the duration of the study were identified.
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index 	18167	18284	There were no differences in CI or SVRI between the two groups based on our longitudinal analysis (P = 0.432; 0.964).
FAST treatment	SLOW treatment	Pulse rate	19638	19745	the pulse rate under the FAST treatment was significantly higher than under the SLOW treatment (P = 0.022).
