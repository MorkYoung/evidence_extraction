tumours with diameter of 2cm or less (T1)	larger tumours (T2/T3)	cumulative recurrence rate reduction due to adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF)	12514	12627	Administration of adjuvant CMF reduces the cumulative recurrence rate in both patients with T1 and T2/T3 tumours.
tumours with diameter of 2cm or less (T1)	larger tumours (T2/T3)	cumulative recurrence rate reduction due to adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF)	12514	13139	Administration of adjuvant CMF reduces the cumulative recurrence rate in both patients with T1 and T2/T3 tumours. The reduction is time-dependent on the relative hazard scale, and ARR shows an early increase to a maximum value at the third year and then decreases to a plateau, which is reached at about the fifth year and persists afterwards up to the end of the observed follow-up. The long-lasting recurrence reduction due to CMF is about 14-16% for patients with T2/T3 tumours and 8-10% for patients with T1 tumours. As already indicated, CMF-related reductions in the two patient subsets are not significantly different.
adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF) for 12 cycles	no further treatment	frequency of tumours with diameter of 2cm or less (T1) and larger tumours (T2/T3)	11536	11657	the frequency of tumours with diameter of 2 cm or less (T1) and larger tumours (T2/T3) are well balanced in the two arms.
adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF) for 12 cycles	no further treatment	tumour-size-related mortality reduction	1299	1446	tumour-size-related mortality reduction reaches a maximum at 5–7 years and then regularly drops to very low values for patients of both trial arms.
adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF) for 12 cycles	no further treatment	tumour-size-related mortality reduction	1299	1445	tumour-size-related mortality reduction reaches a maximum at 5–7 years and then regularly drops to very low values for patients of both trial arms
tumours with diameter of 2cm or less (T1)	larger tumours (T2/T3)	cumulative recurrence rate reduction due to adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF)	13815	14131	Administration of adjuvant CMF reduces the cumulative mortality in patients with both T1 and T2/T3 tumours. The reduction displays an early regular increase to a plateau persisting up to the end of the observed follow-up. The long-lasting mortality reduction due to CMF is about 7-8%, independent on the tumour size.
adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF) for 12 cycles	no further treatment	frequency of tumours with diameter of 2cm or less (T1) and larger tumours (T2/T3)	11521	11657	In particular, the frequency of tumours with diameter of 2 cm or less (T1) and larger tumours (T2/T3) are well balanced in the two arms.
