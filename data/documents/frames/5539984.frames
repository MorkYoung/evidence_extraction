The Network for Mental Health (NWpG-IC)	standard mental health care	Primary outcome effect	-1	-1	Mixed-models for EPAS total score (see Table 3) indicated a significant effect of time (b = 0.07, p < 0.001), but no significant group by time interaction effect (b = 0.02; p = 0.258). This means with regard to the parameterisation of the mixed effects model that there was a significant change of overall empowerment in the control group, but NWpG-IC treatment had no additional effect on improvement of overall empowerment during the 18 month study period.

The Network for Mental Health (NWpG-IC)	standard mental health care	prevalence of psychiatric inpatient admission	24814	25198	The results of the mixed effects logistic regression model (not presented) did neither show differences of the prevalence of psychiatric inpatient admission between groups during the six months before baseline assessment (OR 0.99; p = 0.985), nor a change over time (OR 0.62; p = 0.086) in either groups or a difference between the groups (OR 0.97; p = 0.878) during the study period.
The Network for Mental Health (NWpG-IC)	standard mental health care	reduction of total needs and the increase of met needs	24137	24360	However, as indicated by the non-significant group by time interaction, there was no difference between groups regarding the reduction of total needs (b = 0.09; p = 0.217) or the increase of met needs (b = 0.01; p = 0.621).
