Sonas programme	control	Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores	20048	20490	When stratifying on MMSE (moderate and severe; cut-off of 10 points), a significant difference was found between the Sonas group and the reading group among those with an MMSE score of 0–10 at T0 (p = 0.011) and at T1 (p = 0.044), while among those with an MMSE score of 11–20, there was a significant difference between the Sonas and the reading group at baseline (p = 0.026). No difference was found between the Sonas and the control group.
