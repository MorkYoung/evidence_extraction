Conventional etching with 37% phosphoric acid (group 1)	Irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1 W (group 2) and irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1.5 W (group 3)	Shear bond strength	8578	8746	The mean and standard deviation of the conventional acid-etch group, laser group (1W) and laser group (1.5W) was 3.82 ± 1.16, 6.97 ± 3.64 and 6.93 ± 4.87, respectively.
Conventional etching with 37% phosphoric acid (group 1)	Irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1 W (group 2) and irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1.5 W (group 3)	ARI degrees	9176	9362	Table 2 shows the frequency distribution of ARI degrees in the three groups. According to the Kruskal-Wallis test, there was no significant difference between the three groups (p=0.918).
Conventional etching with 37% phosphoric acid (group 1)	Irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1 W (group 2) and irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1.5 W (group 3)	Shear bond strength	1486	1609	The mean SBS obtained with an Er:YAG laser operated at 1W or 1.5W is approximately similar to that of conventional etching.
Conventional etching with 37% phosphoric acid (group 1)	Irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1 W (group 2) and irradiation with Er:YAG laser at 1.5 W (group 3)	Shear bond strength	1106	1281	One-way analysis of variance was used to compare shear bond strengths and the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to evaluate differences in the ARI for different etching types.
