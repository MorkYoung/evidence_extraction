daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	daunorubicin/ara-C (DA) 	overall survival	14671	14837	No difference was found in survival (DA 15%, DClo 14% HR 0.96 (0.67–1.39), P=0.8; Figure 4a) either overall or within exploratory subgroups (Supplementary Figure S3).
daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	daunorubicin/ara-C (DA)	The overall response rate	12319	12562	There was a trend for a superior CR rate in the DA patients 64% vs DClo, 58% (OR 1.30 (0.98–1.73), P=0.07), and an additional 6 and 8%, respectively, achieved a CRi; thus, the overall response rate was 71% vs 66% (HR 1.26 (0.94–1.70), P=0.12).
daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	daunorubicin/ara-C (DA)	The overall response rate	840	963	The overall response rate was 69% (complete remission (CR) 60% CRi 9%), with no difference between DA (71%) and DClo (66%).
daunorubicin/ara-C (DA)	baseline	red cell and platelet transfusions, days on antibiotic and days in hospital	13676	13813	Significantly more red cell and platelet transfusions, days on antibiotic and days in hospital were required after course 1 in the DA arm
daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	daunorubicin/ara-C (DA)	cumulative incidence of relapse survival from relapse; relapse-free or overall survival 	1168	1459	There were no differences in cumulative incidence of relapse (74% vs 68% hazard ratio (HR) 0.93 (0.77–1.14), P=0.5); survival from relapse (7% vs 9% HR 0.96 (0.77–1.19), P=0.7); relapse-free (31% vs 32% HR 1.02 (0.83–1.24), P=0.9) or overall survival (23% vs 22% HR 1.08 (0.93–1.26), P=0.3).
daunorubicin/ara-C (DA)	baseline	red cell and platelet transfusions, days on antibiotic and days in hospital	13676	13824	Significantly more red cell and platelet transfusions, days on antibiotic and days in hospital were required after course 1 in the DA arm (Table 3).
daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	daunorubicin/ara-C (DA) 	overall survival	1168	1459	There were no differences in cumulative incidence of relapse (74% vs 68% hazard ratio (HR) 0.93 (0.77–1.14), P=0.5); survival from relapse (7% vs 9% HR 0.96 (0.77–1.19), P=0.7); relapse-free (31% vs 32% HR 1.02 (0.83–1.24), P=0.9) or overall survival (23% vs 22% HR 1.08 (0.93–1.26), P=0.3).
daunorubicin/clofarabine (DClo)	baseline	The median day of recovery of neutrophils and platelets	13469	13675	The median day of recovery of neutrophils and platelets measured from the end of the course was significantly longer in the DClo arm (neutrophils 20 vs 24 days, P<0.0001; platelets 21 vs 24 days, P<0.0001).
