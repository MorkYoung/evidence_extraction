telemonitoring group	usual group	ER visits for all causes	1067	1247	Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006).
telemonitoring group	usual group	the number of all-cause re-admissions over a period of six months	1067	1246	Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006)
telemonitoring group	usual group	ER visits for all causes	10815	10985	Similarly, patients in the telemonitoring intervention group had fewer ER visits for all causes than those in the usual care group (0.36 vs. 0.91 per patient; p = 0.006).
telemonitoring group	usual group	the number of all-cause re-admissions over a period of six months	10621	10814	Telemonitoring intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the number of all-cause re-admissions from 0.68 to 0.23 per patient (p = 0.002) over a period of six months (Table 3).
telemonitoring group	usual group	the time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation	918	1066	, time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group (p = 0.026).
telemonitoring group	usual group	the time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation	10061	10243	As shown in Fig. 2, the time to first re-admission for COPD exacerbation was increased in the telemonitoring group as compared with the usual care group (p = 0.026 by log-rank test).
telemonitoring group	usual group	episodes of COPD-related re-admissions or ER visits per capita	1067	1247	Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all-cause re-admissions (0.23 vs. 0.68/patient; p = 0.002) and emergency room visits (0.36 vs. 0.91/patient; p = 0.006).
telemonitoring group	usual group	episodes of COPD-related re-admissions or ER visits per capita	10986	11201	Moreover, the telemonitoring group patients tended to have fewer episodes of COPD-related re-admissions (0.19 vs. 0.49; p = 0.11) or ER visits (0.23 vs. 0.55; p = 0.16) per capita than did usual care group patients.
telemonitoring group	usual group	time to first COPD-related emergency room (ER) visit	10389	10579	In addition, telemonitoring intervention was associated with increased time to first COPD-related ER visit (Fig. 3), with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.24â€“1.04) over the six months of follow-up.
