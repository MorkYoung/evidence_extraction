Neolix 	Control	Microcrack formation	1085	1192	There was a significant difference between Neolix and the control groups in microcrack formation (P=0.042).
ProTaper Universal system	Neolix 	Percentage of cracks	13941	14194	Both rotary and reciprocating systems increased the number and percentage of cracks in roots (13.3% in ProTaper group, 26.7% in SafeSider group and 40% in Neolix group) (Table 1). But, there was no significant difference among the three groups (P>0.05).
ProTaper Universal system	SafeSider	Percentage of cracks	13941	14194	Both rotary and reciprocating systems increased the number and percentage of cracks in roots (13.3% in ProTaper group, 26.7% in SafeSider group and 40% in Neolix group) (Table 1). But, there was no significant difference among the three groups (P>0.05).
Neolix 	SafeSider	Microcrack formation in the coronal section	14195	14318	Micro cracks mainly occurred in the coronal section (9 mm), although was no statistically significant difference (P=0.486).
Neolix 	Control	Microcrack formation	1253	1297	No microcrack occurred in the control group.
Neolix 	Control	Microcrack formation	976	1192	Micro cracks were seen in all experimental groups (13.3% in ProTaper, 26.7% in SafeSider and 40% in Neolix). There was a significant difference between Neolix and the control groups in microcrack formation (P=0.042).
SafeSider	Neolix 	Percentage of cracks	13941	14194	Both rotary and reciprocating systems increased the number and percentage of cracks in roots (13.3% in ProTaper group, 26.7% in SafeSider group and 40% in Neolix group) (Table 1). But, there was no significant difference among the three groups (P>0.05).
