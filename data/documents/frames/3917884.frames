Exercise intervention	Control	LDL cholesterol	25271	25476	No main effects of the E treatment were observed in VO2 max, blood lipids, fasting plasma glucose or serum insulin, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, inflammation markers or IGF-1 (all P -values >0.05,
Diet intervention	Control	LDL cholesterol	1155	1381	There was a significant main effect of the D treatment, decreasing waist circumference (P = 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.007), LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.003) and fasting insulin (P = 0.042), at the end of the 12-wk treatment.
Diet intervention	Control	Fasting insulin	1155	1381	There was a significant main effect of the D treatment, decreasing waist circumference (P = 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.007), LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.003) and fasting insulin (P = 0.042), at the end of the 12-wk treatment.
Diet intervention	Control	Waist circumference	1155	1527	There was a significant main effect of the D treatment, decreasing waist circumference (P = 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.007), LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.003) and fasting insulin (P = 0.042), at the end of the 12-wk treatment. The decreased waist circumference (P<0.001) and insulin (P = 0.024) was sustained and HDL-cholesterol increased (P = 0.005) at the 1-y follow-up.
