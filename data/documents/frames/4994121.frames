Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Postoperative cardiac enzyme levels	1786	1948	The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6±2.7 vs. 10.4±2.0 mg/kg, P< 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P< 0.01).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Stroke volume index 	1377	1518	At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean±sd;29.1±6.3 vs. 18.4±4.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P<0.0001)).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Postoperative inotrophyc requirement 	1786	1948	The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6±2.7 vs. 10.4±2.0 mg/kg, P< 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P< 0.01).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Postoperative inotrophyc requirement 	1786	1881	The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6±2.7 vs. 10.4±2.0 mg/kg, P< 0.008),
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Cardiac index	1703	1785	Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7±37.5 vs. 283.0±83.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P=0.009)).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Need for intra-aortic balloon pump 	2043	2129	We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Stroke volume index 	12405	12684	SVI decreased from 29±10mL/m2 preoperatively to 22±14mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in PG. This was statistically significant (P=0.027). In SG patients exhibited an increase in SVI after surgery from 33±14mL/m2 to 38±5mL/m2. This was statistically significant (P<0.001).
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Postoperative cardiac enzyme levels	1886	1947	postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P< 0.01)
Levosimendan + sodium nitroprusside	Placebo	Need for intra-aortic balloon pump 	11450	11539	We used IABP in eight patients in SG (22.8%) and in 17 patients (48.5%) in PG (P=0.0002).
