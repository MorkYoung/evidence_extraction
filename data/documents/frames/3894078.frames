Microwave sanitization 	Ultraviolet sanitization	Collony-forming units	13523	13849	Tukey's post hoc comparisons of the three groups after the sanitization procedure indicated that the microwave group (M = 1.49, 95% CI [1.2729, 1.7071]) gave a significantly lower CFU count than the UV radiation group (M = 3.22, 95% CI [2.93, 3.50], P < 0.001) and the control group (M = 5.88, 95% CI [5.49, 6.26], P < 0.001).
Ultraviolet sanitization 	Control	Collony-forming units	13850	14003	Comparisons between the UV radiation group and the control groups also showed statistically significant reduction in the microbial CFU count at P < 0.001
Microwave sanitization 	Control	Collony-forming units	1717	1904	after the sanitization procedure, there was a significant (P<0.001) reduction in microbial contamination in both microwave and UV group toothbrushes compared to control group toothbrushes
Microwave sanitization 	Control	Collony-forming units	1698	1904	Result showed that after the sanitization procedure, there was a significant (P<0.001) reduction in microbial contamination in both microwave and UV group toothbrushes compared to control group toothbrushes
Microwave sanitization 	Ultraviolet sanitization	Collony-forming units	1913	2014	the microbial count in the microwave group was significantly less (P<0.001) compared to the UV group.
