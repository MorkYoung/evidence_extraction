Cerebral NIRS monitoring in combination with an evidence based intervention guideline	Blinded collection of NIRS values combined with treatment as usual	Risk of severe brain injury or death	23950	24325	Correlation analyses of the following variables showed a significant correlation (p<0.05) between gestational age, birth weight, clinical chorioamnionitis, surfactant, mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, blood transfusions, and the burden of cerebral hypoxia within the 4th quartile on one hand and the composite outcome of severe brain injury or death on the other.
