Lactobacillus casei Shirota	Placebo	Production of IFN-γ	-1	-1	Delivery of probiotic also suppressed production of sCD23 (p = 0.0081), TGF-β (p = 0.0283) and induced increased production of IFN-γ (p = 0.0351) in supernatants of cultured peripheral blood.Conclusions & Clinical Relevance
Lactobacillus casei Shirota	Placebo	Lung function and asthma symptoms	18290	18502	There were no differences between the two groups for TNSS, PNIF, asthma symptoms or lung function at any of the time points following the nasal allergen challenge before or after the intervention period (Fig. 2).
