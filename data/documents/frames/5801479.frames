vitamin D supplements at a dosage of 50,000 IU (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	placebo (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	gene expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 (MAPK1) 	910	1424	after the 12-week intervention, compared to the placebo, vitamin D supplementation downregulated gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1β (P = 0.02), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P = 0.02) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (P = 0.03) in PBMCs of diabetic HD patients. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation, compared to the placebo, downregulated gene expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) (P = 0.04), protein kinase C (PKC) (P = 0.001), and mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 (MAPK1) (P = 0.02)
vitamin D supplements at a dosage of 50,000 IU (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	placebo (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	gene expression of interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?), interferon gamma (IFN-?) 	877	1178	Results of RT-PCR indicated that after the 12-week intervention, compared to the placebo, vitamin D supplementation downregulated gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1β (P = 0.02), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P = 0.02) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (P = 0.03) in PBMCs of diabetic HD patients.

vitamin D supplements at a dosage of 50,000 IU (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	placebo (n = 30) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks	nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 	1459	1872	Although not significant, vitamin D supplementation let to a reduction of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) (p = 0.75) expression in PBMCs isolated from diabetic patients compared to the placebo group. There was no statistically significant change following supplementation with vitamin D on gene expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PBMCs of diabetic HD patients.
