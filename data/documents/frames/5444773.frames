Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Mean airway pressure	1581	1623	PSV resulted in lower mean airway pressure
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, septal thickening, or DAD score in nIAP animals	18950	19113	In nIAP animals, no significant differences were observed between PCV and PSV with regard to alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, septal thickening, or DAD score
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, or DAD score in animals with IAH	1833	1960	In the presence of IAH, PSV improved oxygenation; decreased alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, and diffuse alveolar damage;
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	mRNA expression of IL-6 and type III procollagen	1542	1832	Regardless of whether IAH was present, PSV resulted in lower mean airway pressure (with no differences in peak airway or peak and mean transpulmonary pressures) and less mRNA expression of biomarkers associated with lung inflammation (IL-6) and fibrogenesis (type III procollagen) than PCV.
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, or DAD score in animals with IAH	19159	19268	in the IAH group, PSV was associated with less alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, and DAD compared to PCV
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	mRNA expression of IL-6 and type III procollagen	1581	1832	PSV resulted in lower mean airway pressure (with no differences in peak airway or peak and mean transpulmonary pressures) and less mRNA expression of biomarkers associated with lung inflammation (IL-6) and fibrogenesis (type III procollagen) than PCV.
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Surfactant protein B expression	1833	2029	In the presence of IAH, PSV improved oxygenation; decreased alveolar collapse, interstitial edema, and diffuse alveolar damage; and increased expression of surfactant protein B as compared to PCV.
Pressure support ventilation (PSV)	Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)	Mean airway pressure	1542	1832	Regardless of whether IAH was present, PSV resulted in lower mean airway pressure (with no differences in peak airway or peak and mean transpulmonary pressures) and less mRNA expression of biomarkers associated with lung inflammation (IL-6) and fibrogenesis (type III procollagen) than PCV.
