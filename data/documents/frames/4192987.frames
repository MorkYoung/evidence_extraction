10-15 mg/m2 total dose of hydrocortisone. Two-fifths of the total dose of hydrocortisone was administered in the morning and one-fifth of the total dose was administered at 06.00-07.00 pm	10-15 mg/m2 total dose of hydrocortisone. Two-fifths of the total dose of hydrocortisone was administered in the morning and one-fifth of the total dose was replaced by equivalent dose of prednisolone suspension which was administered at 10.00 pm.	Median 17-hydroxy progesterone and testosterone levels	16164	16297	The difference in median was not statistically significant for serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone levels [Tables 2 and 3].
