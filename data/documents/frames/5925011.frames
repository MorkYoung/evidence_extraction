intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	effect size after six months compared to immediate postoperative measurements	14045	14239	the effect size after six months compared to immediate postoperative measurements was much stronger for the intervention group (Cohen's d = 4.85) compared to the control group (Cohen's d = 2.64)
intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	mean RF measured immediately after surgery	12094	12271	The mean RF measured immediately after surgery showed no important or statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups (55.3% and 53.2%, resp.).
intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	FD mesial values after six months of follow-up 	13824	14034	After six months of follow-up, the FD-mesial values were significantly increased by a mean of 0.132 units in the control group and 0.342 units in the intervention group which reflects a very strong effect size.
intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	FD analysis	13640	13822	The mean FD measured immediately after surgery also showed no important or statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups (1.338 and 1.319, resp.).
intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	effect size after six months compared to immediate postoperative measurements	13276	13480	Moreover, the effect size after six months compared to immediate postoperative measurements was much stronger for the intervention group (Cohen's d = 7.4) compared to the control group (Cohen's d = 2.25).
intervention group with added low-intensity power ultrasound treatment (LIPUS)	standard implant protocol treatment	mean RF measured immediately after surgery	12094	12270	The mean RF measured immediately after surgery showed no important or statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups (55.3% and 53.2%, resp.)
