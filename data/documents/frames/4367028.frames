Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30° 	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	SBP and DBP	13551	13730	Head down tilt was associated with a rising trend in SBP and DBP which was higher in TBG >30° than TBG <30° group however the results were not statistically significant [Table 4].
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30°	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	Nitroglycerine and fentanyl use	14378	14518	Nitroglycerine and fentanyl use in TBG >30° group was higher and statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared with TBG <30° [Table 6].
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30° 	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	pulse rate	13731	13885	Interestingly, pulse rate decreased with head down tilt and fall was much higher in TBG >30° than TBG <30° group but without any statistical significance.
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30°	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	PACU stay	14519	14612	Again PACU stay was longer (P < 0.05) in TBG >30° group compared to TBG <30° group [Table 6].
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30°	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	Bispectral index values	14049	14377	Bispectral index values also gradually increased with head down tilt and TBG >30° group showed higher BIS value than TBG <30° [Table 5 and Figure 1]. Although the BIS values among two groups were statistically significant, the patients from either group didn't complain of its awareness (probably due to their anesthetic state).
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30°	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	Bispectral index values	1319	1476	TBG >30° showed a higher BIS value than TBG <30°. This statistically significant (P < 0.05) trend was observed at all the 30, 60, 90, and 120th min interval.
Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt >30° 	Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt <30°	SBP and DBP	13175	13338	Baseline hemodynamic parameters like SBP, DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse rate and also hemoglobin were found to be comparable [Table 3] among two groups.
