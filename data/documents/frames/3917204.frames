received treatment with rotary instruments	received scaling and root planing with hand instruments	Clinical improvement in multi-rooted teeth 	10176	10358	Clinical improvement was noticed in both moderately deep pocket sites and deep pocket areas. But comparison of groups showed them to be statistically nonsignificant [Tables 4 and 5].
received treatment with rotary instruments	received scaling and root planing with hand instruments	Probing depth (PD), Gingival recession (GR), Clinical attachment level (CAL)	9354	9729	At deep pocket site (initial PD > 6 mm), in the rotary instrument group, PD reduced from 7.2 ± 1.5 to 6.5 ± 1.8 and in the Gracey curette group, it reduced from 6.7 ± 0.9 to 5.4 ± 1.8. But while comparing these two groups, the results were statistically nonsignificant. Similarly, other clinical parameters like GR and CAL gave statistically nonsignificant results [Table 3].
received treatment with rotary instruments	received scaling and root planing with hand instruments	Clinical improvement in multi-rooted teeth 	10051	10358	In the rotary instrument group, 256 multi-rooted teeth and in the Gracey curette group, 302 multi-rooted teeth were treated. Clinical improvement was noticed in both moderately deep pocket sites and deep pocket areas. But comparison of groups showed them to be statistically nonsignificant [Tables 4 and 5].
