neurovascular bundle preservation (NBP)	conventional thoracotomy (CT)	postoperative complications	14982	15159	Regarding the occurrence of postoperative complications, there were no significant <NEWLINE>differences between the conventional thoracotomy and NBP groups (28.18% vs. 30.77%; p = <NEWLINE>0.58).
neurovascular bundle preservation (NBP)	conventional thoracotomy (CT)	postoperative pain on day 5	1076	1248	On postoperative day 5, the self-reported pain intensity was significantly lower <NEWLINE>in the NBP group than in the CT group (visual analog scale score, 1.50 vs. 3.29; p <NEWLINE>= 0.04).
neurovascular bundle preservation (NBP)	conventional thoracotomy (CT)	postoperative pain on day 5	13957	14178	Although postoperative pain intensity on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5 was lower <NEWLINE>in the NBP group than in the conventional thoracotomy group, the difference was <NEWLINE>significant only on postoperative day 5 (p = 0.04; Table 3)
neurovascular bundle preservation (NBP)	conventional thoracotomy (CT)	The mean consumption of dipyrone	14718	14980	The mean consumption of tramadol hydrochloride was 1,025 <NEWLINE>± 464 mg in the conventional thoracotomy group and 834 ± 568 mg in the NBP group (p = <NEWLINE>0.22). The mean consumption of dipyrone was 16.67 ± 12.06 g in the former and 15.71 ± <NEWLINE>11.73 g in the latter (p = 0.98).
