Everolimus	Placebo	Progression-free survival in prior Chemo-Patients	13979	14243	In the prior chemotherapy group, median PFS according to central assessment was 11.4 months (95% CI, 8.7–18.1) for everolimus versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.1–6.4) for placebo (HR for disease progression or death with everolimus, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21–0.48; P < 0.0001)
Everolimus	Placebo	Progression-free survival in Chemo-naive Patients	847	1162	Everolimus significantly prolonged median progression-free survival regardless of prior chemotherapy use (prior chemotherapy: 11.0 vs 3.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.48; P < 0.0001) (chemonaive: 11.4 vs 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.29–0.60; P < 0.0001).
Everolimus	Placebo	Progression-free survival in prior Chemo-Patients	13121	13462	For patients who received prior chemotherapy, the median PFS assessed by local investigator review was 11.0 months (95% CI, 8.2–13.9) for everolimus versus 3.2 (2.8–5.1) months for placebo, representing a 3.5-fold prolongation in median PFS and a 66% reduction in the estimated risk for progression (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25–0.48; P < 0.0001).
Everolimus	Placebo	Progression-free survival in prior Chemo-Patients	847	1162	Everolimus significantly prolonged median progression-free survival regardless of prior chemotherapy use (prior chemotherapy: 11.0 vs 3.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.48; P < 0.0001) (chemonaive: 11.4 vs 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.29–0.60; P < 0.0001).
Everolimus	Placebo	Progression-free survival in Chemo-naive Patients	1061	1161	(chemonaive: 11.4 vs 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.29–0.60; P < 0.0001)
