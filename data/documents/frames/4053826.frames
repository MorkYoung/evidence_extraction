the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	pain scores at rest at 8 hours and at 16 hours 	1243	1355	Pain scores at rest were lower for the ropivacaine group and reached significance after 8 and 16 hours (P<0.01).
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	patient satisfaction	11367	11441	There was no difference with respect to patient satisfaction (Table 2, 3).
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	The mean total sufentanil consumption at 48 hours 	12157	12347	The mean total sufentanil consumption by the control group at 48 hours was double that of the Ropi group (89.70±35.22 μg for the control group vs. 41.50±21.80 μg for the Ropi group; P<0.01).
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	pain score on movement	1754	1860	There was no difference with respect to pain scores on movement, nor with respect to patient satisfaction.
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	patient satisfaction	1754	1860	There was no difference with respect to pain scores on movement, nor with respect to patient satisfaction.
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	Time to bowel recovery, incidence of nausea/vomiting, mean length of hospitalization	11027	11247	Time to bowel recovery (1.80±0.70 vs. 3.15±1.04 d; P<0.01), incidence of nausea/vomiting (1.75±0.72 vs. 2.4±0.68; P<0.05), and mean length of hospitalization (5.6±2.44 vs. 7.35±2.85 d; P<0.01) were significantly reduced.
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	pain score on movement	11920	12022	However, there was no difference in pain score on movement between the 2 groups, as shown in Figure 2.
the ropivacaine continuous infusion (the Ropi group)	the 0.9% saline continuous infusion (the control group)	pain scores at rest at 8 hours and at 16 hours 	11654	11919	Significant differences in pain scores at rest between the 2 groups were detected at 8 hours (NRS 1.5±0.51 for the Ropi group and 2.45±0.51 for the control group; P<0.01) and at 16 hours (NRS 1.75±0.44 for the Ropi group and 2.1±0.31 for the control group; P<0.01).
