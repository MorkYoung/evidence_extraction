colloid preload - hydroxyethyl starch (6% in normal saline, 500 ml)	crystalloid preload - Lactated Ringer's solution (1500 ml)	incidence of maternal nausea and vomiting	14260	14416	The incidence of maternal nausea and vomiting, as well as APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min, were not significantly different within each group and between groups
colloid preload - hydroxyethyl starch (6% in normal saline, 500 ml)	crystalloid preload - Lactated Ringer's solution (1500 ml)	Use of phenylephrine	1124	1261	Significantly less phenylephrine (1077.5 ± 514 mcg) was used in the colloid group than the crystalloid group (1477 ± 591 mcg, P = 0.003).
colloid preload - hydroxyethyl starch (6% in normal saline, 500 ml)	crystalloid preload - Lactated Ringer's solution (1500 ml)	elective cesarean delivery (CD) reduction in spinal-induced hypotension (SIH)	841	1010	There was no statistical difference between groups with regards to the incidence of hypotension (10.8% in the colloid group vs. 27.0% in the crystalloid group, P = 0.12)
colloid preload - hydroxyethyl starch (6% in normal saline, 500 ml)	crystalloid preload - Lactated Ringer's solution (1500 ml)	incidence of bradycardia	1012	1123	There was also no difference between groups with respect to bradycardia, APGAR scores, and nausea and vomiting.

colloid preload - hydroxyethyl starch (6% in normal saline, 500 ml)	crystalloid preload - Lactated Ringer's solution (1500 ml)	overall incidence of APGAR score	14428	14600	The overall incidence of APGAR scores below 7 was 2.7% in the crystalloid group and 8.1% in the colloid group respectively, but was not significantly different (P = 0.358).
