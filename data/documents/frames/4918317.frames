Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)	placebo	Positive and Negative Syndrome (PANS) Scale	8772	9067	For the PANSS measures, interactions between medication group and occasion were significant for positive (F4,133.6=4.48, P=0.002), general (F4,125.3=4.52, P=0.002) and total scores (F4,125.0=4.59, P=0.002), and were trending towards significance for the negative scores (F4,129.4=2.16, P=0.077).
Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)	placebo	Positive and Negative Syndrome (PANS) Scale	9132	9230	omega-3 group had significantly lower scores than the placebo group on all PANSS measures (<0.05).
Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)	placebo	functioning at longer-term follow-up	8495	8771	Repeated-measures mixed model analysis indicated a significant interaction between medication group and occasion for GAF scores (F4,122.5=2.67, P=0.035), and the omega-3 PUFA group had significantly higher functioning than the placebo group at longer-term follow-up (P=0.011).
