Positive related	Negative related	Valence (Experiment 2)	27015	27130	There was a trend for the valence ratings to be higher in the PR than in the NR condition (t(24) = 1.95, p = 0.06).

Positive unrelated,	Positive related, Negative related	Vividness (Experiment 1)	17813	18030	Conditions also differed on vividness (F(2, 40) = 5.65, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.04), with the PU script being rated as most vivid (PR: p = 0.01; NR: p = 0.003) and no differences between the PR and NR conditions (p = 0.80).

Positive unrelated	Positive related, Negative related	Anxiety increase (Experiment 1)	18509	18665	. Posthoc analyses showed that increases in anxiety in the PU condition were greater than in the PR and NR conditions (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively).
Positive unrelated	Positive related, Negative related	Valence (Experiment 1)	17526	17812	conditions differed on valence (F(2, 40) = 40.05, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.67) but not on arousal (F(2, 40) = 0.87, p = 0.42, ηp2 = 0.04). The PU script was rated as more pleasant than the PR and NR scripts (both p's < 0.001), and the PR script as more pleasant than the NR script (p = 0.02).
