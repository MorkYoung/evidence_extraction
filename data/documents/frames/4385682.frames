B. dracunculifolia	other mouthwashes	preliminary time plaque index (PI)	10563	10766	The comparison between the products in each time with the preliminary time (washout 24 hours, t = 0) does not present difference in plaque index (PI) of individuals for all products evaluated (P = 0.510)
B. dracunculifolia	other mouthwashes	preliminary time plaque index (PI)	856	927	there was no difference between the four products evaluated (P = 0.674)
B. dracunculifolia	other mouthwashes	efficacy in the reduction of dental biofilm after one week	832	927	After one week (t = 2), there was no difference between the four products evaluated (P = 0.674)
B. dracunculifolia	other mouthwashes	similar reduction in plaque	709	928	there was no difference between products (P = 0.602); that is, subjects in the study had a similar PI after the first use. After one week (t = 2), there was no difference between the four products evaluated (P = 0.674),
