positive Twitter messages	negative Twitter messages	Integrated skin conductance responses (iSCRs)	35721	35832	Consistently, the effect of tweet condition on physiological arousal (iSCR) was also non-significant (Table 2).
positive Twitter messages	negative Twitter messages	viewing times	38771	38966	For positive news videos, negative tweets elicited significantly longer viewing times than positive tweets, 95% CIs [0.20, 0.85] and [4%, 10%] for self-reports and gaze dwell times, respectively.
positive Twitter messages	negative Twitter messages	viewing times	1036	1154	As expected, negative tweets drew longer viewing times and elicited more attention to themselves than positive tweets.
positive ratings for positive Twitter messages	negative ratings for negative Twitter messages	ratings	34720	34890	Specifically, participants gave more negative ratings for negative than for positive tweets that were paired with positive news videos (p < 0.001), 95% CI [–0.32, –0.82].
positive Twitter messages	negative Twitter messages	self-assessment manikin (SAM) arousal ratings	35476	35547	No significant effects were observed for SAM arousal ratings (Table 2).
