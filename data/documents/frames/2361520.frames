receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	time to disease progression or survival	15963	16121	The time to disease progression from randomisation to after chemotherapy was similar in the immediate- and delayed-treatment groups for both studies (Table 3)
receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	Median survival	1158	1325	Median survival was not significantly better with immediate treatment (median 13.0 vs 11.0 months; hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–1.72; P=0.49).
receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	overall QoL	19005	19175	There was no statistically significant difference in overall QoL or any component domain between the two treatment strategies at baseline or at any subsequent time point.
receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	Median survival	17364	17649	Median survival was 13.0 months in patients receiving immediate treatment and 11.0 months in the delayed-treatment group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI 0.79–1.47) (Figure 2). Adjustment for risk factors did not significantly change the hazard ratio (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI 0.77–1.72).
receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	overall QoL	1554	1700	There was no difference in overall QoL or its individual domains between the two treatment strategies at baseline or at any subsequent time point.
receive immediate treatment	receive delayed treatment	progression-free survival	1326	1553	There was no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (time from randomisation until first evidence of progression after chemotherapy, 10.2 vs 10.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI 0.71–1.64; P=0.73).
