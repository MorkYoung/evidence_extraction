Extended depth-of-focus (EDOF)	Center-near lens (AOMF)	Purchase preferance	1814	1898	Significantly more participants chose to only-purchase EDOF (33% vs. 6%, p = 0.003).
Extended depth-of-focus (EDOF)	Center-near lens (AOMF)	Intermediate and near clarity-of-vision	20335	20464	Clarity-of-vision at intermediate and near were rated significantly higher with EDOF (Fig. 2, p = 0.006, p = 0.005 respectively).
Extended depth-of-focus (EDOF)	Center-near lens (AOMF)	Intermediate and near clarity-of-vision	1397	1813	EDOF was significantly better than AOMF for HCVA at 40 cm (0.42 ± 0.18 vs. 0.48 ± 0.22, p = 0.024), stereopsis (98 ± 88 vs. 141 ± 114, p < 0.001), clarity-of-vision at intermediate (8.5 ± 1.6 vs. 7.7 ± 1.9, p = 0.006) and near (7.3 ± 2.5 vs. 6.2 ± 2.5, p = 0.005), lack-of-ghosting (p = 0.012), overall vision satisfaction (7.5 ± 1.7 vs. 6.4 ± 2.2, p < 0.001) and ocular comfort (9.0 ± 1.0 vs. 8.3 ± 1.7, p = 0.002).
