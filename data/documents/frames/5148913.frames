BDP/FF 200/6 μg pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 μg (four puffs twice a day)	The mean average use of rescue medication	1225	1366	Overall, BDP/FF and BDP showed a similar improvement of symptom-based parameters and of the use of rescue medication after 3-month treatment.
BDP/FF 200/6 Î1⁄4g pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 Î1⁄4g (four puffs twice a day)	The ACQ scores	17403	17722	he ACQ scores were similar in the BDP/FF and BDP at baseline (2.12 and 2.16, respectively). Both treatments resulted in a statistically significant reduction in ACQ score from baseline to Week12 (p < 0.001), above the minimal clinical difference of 0.5 points. The extent of the reduction was similar across treatments.
BDP/FF 200/6 Î1⁄4g pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 Î1⁄4g (four puffs twice a day)	adjusted mean change of PEF	-1	-1	The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline between the two treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of the BDP/FF group (19 L/min, 95% CI: 10, 27; p < 0.001), indicating superiority of BDP/FF treatment vs. BDP (Table 2).
BDP/FF 200/6 Î1⁄4g pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 Î1⁄4g (four puffs twice a day)	adjusted mean change of PEF	900	1226	The primary endpoint [change from baseline over the entire treatment period in average pre-dose morning peak expiratory flow (PEF)] demonstrated the superiority of BDP/FF over BDP monotherapy, with an adjusted mean difference of 19 L/min, which is above the minimal important clinical difference reported for this parameter.

BDP/FF 200/6 Î1⁄4g pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 Î1⁄4g (four puffs twice a day)	pre-dose morning FEV1	-1	-1	Both treatments showed a statistically significant increase in pre-dose morning FEV1 from baseline to each clinic visit and over the entire treatment period (p < 0.001) with a difference of 0.071 L in favour of BDP/FF group (p = 0.058). When reversibility test results were added as covariate (post-hoc analysis), the magnitude of the FEV1 difference between groups were even larger 0.087 L (p = 0.016) in favour of BDP/FF (Fig. 3).Fig. 3

Both treatments resulted in a statistically significant reduction in ACQ score from baseline to Week12 (p < 0.001), above the minimal clinical difference of 0.5 points. The extent of the reduction was similar across treatments.

BDP/FF 200/6 μg pMDI extrafine (two puffs twice a day)	BDP 100 μg (four puffs twice a day)	The mean average use of rescue medication	15695	16218	The mean average use of rescue medication was similar in the BDP/FF and BDP groups at baseline (2.7 and 2.9 puffs/day respectively) and decreased significantly in both groups at the end of the treatment period (1.4 and 1.7 puffs/day respectively; p < 0.001 vs baseline). There were no statistically significant differences between the adjusted mean changes in use of rescue medication across treatment groups at each inter-visit period (p-value ranging from 0.051 to 0.586) and over the entire treatment period (p = 0.143).
