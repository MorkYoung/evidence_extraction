BV juice (480 mL/day	BV juice placebo at the same time (480 mL/day,	C-peptide levels	20564	20708	Serum C-peptide decreased by 8% after treatment with BV relative to placebo, whereas these changes were not statistically significant (Table 3).
BV juice (480 mL/day	BV juice placebo at the same time (480 mL/day,	C-peptide levels	20460	20697	There was also a significant increase in C-peptide levels both in the placebo, and BV groups (Table 3). Serum C-peptide decreased by 8% after treatment with BV relative to placebo, whereas these changes were not statistically significant
BV juice (480 mL/day)	placebo	(HOMA-B) homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function 	20913	21007	HOMA-B increased by 44% relative to placebo after 8 weeks treatment of the BV group (Table 3).
BV juice (480 mL/day)	placebo	(HOMA-B) homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function 	20826	20996	Although there were significant decreases of HOMA-B levels in both groups (P < 0.001), HOMA-B increased by 44% relative to placebo after 8 weeks treatment of the BV group
BV juice (480 mL/day)	placebo	homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR)	20709	20814	HOMA-IR showed 16% decrease in BV group relative to the placebo, but it was not statistically significant
BV juice (480 mL/day)	placebo	homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR)	20709	20825	HOMA-IR showed 16% decrease in BV group relative to the placebo, but it was not statistically significant (Table 3).
