Lixisenatide	Control	Left-ventricular wall thickness	25403	25521	Left-ventricular wall thickness was reduced by ischemia-reperfusion and not significantly modified by treatment groups
Lixisenatide	Control	Infarct size	21022	21142	Treatment with lixisenatide significantly reduced infarct-size when starting 10 min prior to end of ischemia (Figure 1).
Lixisenatide	Control	Left ventricular risk area 	21274	21549	There were no differences between the different treatment groups regarding left ventricular total area (543 ± 16 mm2 for placebo versus 505 ± 7 mm2 for lixisenatide treatment) left ventricular risk area (306 ± 9 mm2 for placebo versus 288 ± 5 mm2 for lixisenatide treatment).
Lixisenatide	Control	Septal wall thickness	25535	25592	Septal wall thickness was not altered between any groups.
Lixisenatide	Control	Left ventricular total area 	21274	21549	There were no differences between the different treatment groups regarding left ventricular total area (543 ± 16 mm2 for placebo versus 505 ± 7 mm2 for lixisenatide treatment) left ventricular risk area (306 ± 9 mm2 for placebo versus 288 ± 5 mm2 for lixisenatide treatment).
Lixisenatide	Control	Infarct size	21143	21273	Infarct area in placebo hearts was 162 ± 12 mm2, and in lixisenatide treated hearts 98 ± 9 (mean values ± SEM, n=10-11, p < 0.05).
Lixisenatide	Control	Infarct area to area at risk ratio	21550	21670	Overall, the ratio of infarct area to area at risk was reduced by lixisenatide by 36% when compared to placebo treatment
