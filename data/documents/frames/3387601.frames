plasma exchange (PE) 	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	Period of mechanical ventilation 	1301	1461	Children in the PE group had a shorter period of MV (median 11 days, IQR 11.0 to 13.0) compared to IVIG group (median 13 days, IQR 11.3 to 14.5) with p = 0.037.
plasma exchange (PE) 	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	side effects	15898	16014	There was no significant side effect attributable to any of the treatment modalities in any of the studied patients.
plasma exchange (PE)	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	negative correlation between CSF protein and duration of mechanical ventilation	1731	1890	There was a negative correlation between CSF protein and duration of mechanical ventilation in the PE group (p = 0.037), but not in the IVIG group (p = 0.132).
plasma exchange (PE) 	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	Period of mechanical ventilation 	14850	14966	Children receiving PE had a significantly shorter period of mechanical ventilation compared to those receiving IVIG.
plasma exchange (PE) 	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	could walk unaided within four weeks after PICU discharge	1570	1729	A total of 20/21 (95.2%) and 18/20 (90%) children in the PE and IVIG groups respectively could walk unaided within four weeks after PICU discharge (p = 0.606).
plasma exchange (PE)	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	negative correlation between CSF protein and duration of mechanical ventilation	15206	15372	Examining the treatment groups separately, the significant negative correlation remained for the PE group (p-value = 0.037) and not for the IVIG group (p-value 0.132)
plasma exchange (PE) 	intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)	Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay	1463	1568	Those in the PE group had a tendency for a shorter Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay (p = 0.094).
