normal weight group following consumption of the high protein, high fat meal	normal weight group following consumption of the high protein, low fat meal	change in energy expenditure	20128	20431	While there was not an effect of meal type in the overweight or underweight groups, the change in energy expenditure was significantly (p = 0.0014) greater in the normal weight group following consumption of the high protein, high fat meal versus following consumption of the high protein, low fat meal.
overweight group	normal weight group, underweight group.	overall effect of BMI	17707	17994	Similarly, when energy expenditure was expressed as the change in kcal/min/ffm, the overall effect of BMI was significant (p = 0.0034), with the values for the overweight group significantly greater than the normal weight group which was significantly greater than the underweight group.
underweight	overweight	Changes in metabolic rate (MR) (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg ffm)	1706	1917	Changes in MR (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg ffm) from the baseline rate did not significantly differ in the underweight (n = 3) or in the overweight subjects (n = 5) following consumption of either meal at any time.
normal weight group - high protein, high fat meal	normal weight group - high protein, low fat meal	Changes in metabolic rate (MR) (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg ffm)	1918	2115	Changes in MR (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg ffm) from baseline were significantly higher in normal weight subjects (n = 11) across all times following consumption of the HPHF meal versus the HPLF meal.
normal weight group - high protein, high fat meal	normal weight group - high protein, low fat meal	Changes in metabolic rate (MR) (kcal/min and kcal/min/kg ffm)	20128	20431	While there was not an effect of meal type in the overweight or underweight groups, the change in energy expenditure was significantly (p = 0.0014) greater in the normal weight group following consumption of the high protein, high fat meal versus following consumption of the high protein, low fat meal.
