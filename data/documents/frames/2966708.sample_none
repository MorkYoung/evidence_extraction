0	52	abdominal hysterectomy	laparoscopic hysterectomy	duration of the postoperative hospital stay	The duration of the postoperative hospital stay for the patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy was 5.6 ± 0.5 days as compared to 7.9 ± 0.2 days for the patients who underwent abdominal hysterectomy (P < 0.05).
1	56	abdominal hysterectomy	laparoscopic hysterectomy	peak IL - 6 concentration	For the patients who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, the peak IL-6 concentration was significant higher than the peak IL-6 levels of the patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy (P < 0.05).
2	56	abdominal hysterectomy	laparoscopic hysterectomy	peak IL - 6 levels	For the patients who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, the peak IL-6 concentration was significant higher than the peak IL-6 levels of the patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy (P < 0.05).
3	62	abdominal hysterectomy	laparoscopic hysterectomy	mean CRP concentration	The mean CRP concentration at 24 hr postoperatively was 10.8 mg/L in the patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy as compared to that of the patients who underwent abdominal hysterectomy (39.5 mg/L) (P < 0.05) and there was correlation with between the cytokine and CRP levels (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.796; P < 0.05).
