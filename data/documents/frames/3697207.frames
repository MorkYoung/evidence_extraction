Extracorporeal shock wave therapy	Control	Pain 	11359	11480	after three months follow-up, pain scores was significantly lower in the ESWT group than in the placebo group (P = 0.04).
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy	Control	Plantar fascia thickness	10906	11079	After treatment, the mean plantar fascia thickness was significantly decreased in the ESWT group (P < 0.001), while it was slightly increased in the placebo group (P = 0.03)
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy	Control	Pain 	1193	1405	Both groups showed significant pain improvement over the course of the study (P < 0.001), though pain scores were significantly more reduced in the ESWT than the sham group (-4.2 ± 2.9 vs. -2.7 ± 1.8, P = 0.049).
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy	Control	Plantar fascia thickness	985	1192	Over the study period, plantar fascia thickness significantly reduced in the ESWT group (4.1 ± 1.3 to 3.6 ± 1.2 mm, P < 0.001), but slightly increased in the sham group (4.1 ± 0.8 to 4.5 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.03).
