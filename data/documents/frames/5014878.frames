quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil®)	baseline	Mean antibody reactivity against the associated HPV	-1	-1	The mean post-vaccination antibody reactivity was 4690 MFI (SD 727). All individual antibody reactivities increased after vaccination, with a median rise of 3766 MFI (range 1199–4670). The mean MFI per patient rose significantly after vaccination (p < 0.001).
quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil®)	baseline	Mean antibody reactivity against the associated HPV	660	825	Mean antibody reactivity against the associated HPV type rose from 1125 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) pre-vaccination to 4690 MFI post-vaccination (p < 0.001).
