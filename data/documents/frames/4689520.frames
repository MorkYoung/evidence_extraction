Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Resting diastolic blood pressure	24485	24742	The reduction in systolic blood pressure after dosing between treatment conditions was not significantly different, however, the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was greater in the nitrate supplemented group (7±8 nitrate vs. 1±8mmHg placebo; p = 0.008)
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Systolic blood pressure	24485	24600	The reduction in systolic blood pressure after dosing between treatment conditions was not significantly different,
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Systolic blood pressure	24485	24742	The reduction in systolic blood pressure after dosing between treatment conditions was not significantly different, however, the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was greater in the nitrate supplemented group (7±8 nitrate vs. 1±8mmHg placebo; p = 0.008)
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Isotime oxygen consumption	1401	1555	However, isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6±6.0ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2±6.0ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043)
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Median endurance time	1266	1399	Median endurance time did not differ significantly; nitrate 5.65 (3.90–10.40) minutes vs. placebo 6.40 (4.01–9.67) minutes (p = 0.50)
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Resting diastolic blood pressure	1113	1265	Resting diastolic blood pressure fell significantly with nitrate supplementation compared to placebo (-7±8mmHg nitrate vs. -1±8mmHg placebo; p = 0.008).
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Isotime oxygen consumption	1410	1556	isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6±6.0ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2±6.0ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043),
Nitrate supplementation	Placebo 	Mean areterial blood pressure	24744	24944	There was a trend towards greater lowering of the mean arterial pressure following nitrate supplementation, although this was not statistically significant (7±8 nitrate vs. 3±8mmHg placebo; p = 0.07).
