Tannic acid	Distilled water 	Self-adhesive resin cement strength	1303	1417	There was significant difference in the shear bond strength of control and tannic acid contaminated group (p<0.05)
Ferric sulphate	Distilled water 	Self-adhesive resin cement strength	9555	9750	Even though Group II (Aluminium chloride) [9.83±1.50] and Group III (Ferric sulphate) [8.27±4.36] showed reduced SBS as compared to the control, there was no statistically significant difference.
Aluminium chloride	Distilled water 	Self-adhesive resin cement strength	1427	1571	there was no significant differences between the shear bond strength between control and aluminium chloride and ferric sulphate groups (p>0.05).
