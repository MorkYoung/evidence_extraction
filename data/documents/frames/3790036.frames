10 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure	3, 5, and 7 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure	Improvement in PaO2 levels 	11593	11799	In the 10 PEEP group, the PaO2 levels were significantly higher after 1 h of CO2-insufflation compared with preinsufflation levels (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences among the PEEP groups
5, 7, and 10 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure	0 and 3 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure	PaCO2 levels after 3 h of CO2-insufflation	12255	12429	The PaCO2 levels in the 5, 7 and 10 PEEP groups showed significantly higher levels compared with those in the ZEEP and 3 PEEP groups after 3 h of CO2-insufflation (P < 0.05).
Use of positive end-expiratory pressure	No use of positive end-expiratory pressure	Improvement in PaO2 levels 	1009	1343	The PaO2 levels and alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension (AaDO2) were improved in patients with PEEPs compared with patients in whom PEEP was not used. The application of PEEP (10 cmH2O) resulted in higher PaO2 levels compared to those with lower PEEP levels, but excessive peak airway pressure (PAP) was sometimes observed.
Use of positive end-expiratory pressure	No use of positive end-expiratory pressure	Improvement in PaO2 levels 	1009	1170	The PaO2 levels and alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension (AaDO2) were improved in patients with PEEPs compared with patients in whom PEEP was not used.
Use of positive end-expiratory pressure	No use of positive end-expiratory pressure	Improvement in alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension	1009	1170	The PaO2 levels and alveolar-arterial difference in oxygen tension (AaDO2) were improved in patients with PEEPs compared with patients in whom PEEP was not used.
Use of positive end-expiratory pressure	No use of positive end-expiratory pressure	Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and minute ventilation	1530	1647	there were no significant differences in heart rate, mean arterial pressure or minute ventilation between the groups.
