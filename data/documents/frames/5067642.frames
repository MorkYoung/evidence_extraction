standard behavioral weight loss; a technology‐based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (TECH) ; an enhanced technology‐based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (EN‐TECH)	baseline	standard behavioral weight loss,	21093	21460	Weight loss occurred in all intervention conditions across 6 months (p < 0.0001) (Table 2 and Figure 2). Weight loss (least square means ± standard error) at 3 months was −3.39 ± 1.04, −5.06 ± 1.08 and −4.76 ± 1.25 kg in SBWL, TECH and EN‐TECH, respectively. Weight loss at 6 months was −6.57 ± 1.65 kg in SBWL, −5.18 ± 1.72 kg in TECH and −6.25 ± 1.95 kg in EN‐TECH.
