Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Baseline characteristics	19469	19628	The results showed that the women in both groups did not have any difference and were similar with respect to some of the demographic characteristics (P>0.05).
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Vaginal pH	18611	18869	studies showed that comparing the results of intra-group (before and after treatment), the amount of PH of both groups reduced, moving towards acidity (P<0.001) and no significant difference was obtained when the results of both groups were compared (P>0.05)
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Improvement in the composite score of vaginal symptoms	1677	1872	Improvement in urinary incontinence, dryness, maturation index (P<0.05) and composite score of vaginal symptoms (P<0.001) in the hyaluronic acid group was better than those in the Premarin group.
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Baseline characteristics	15626	15931	The results showed that from the view point of age, menarche, age of menopause beginning, number of pregnancies, occupation, education, disease history and drug consumption both therapeutic groups were similar and the Chi-square test did not show any statistical significant difference (P>0.05) (table 1).
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Baseline characteristics	15650	15920	from the view point of age, menarche, age of menopause beginning, number of pregnancies, occupation, education, disease history and drug consumption both therapeutic groups were similar and the Chi-square test did not show any statistical significant difference (P>0.05)
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Improvement in urinary incontinence	1675	1872	. Improvement in urinary incontinence, dryness, maturation index (P<0.05) and composite score of vaginal symptoms (P<0.001) in the hyaluronic acid group was better than those in the Premarin group.
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Improvement in urinary incontinence	1593	1675	Urinary incontinence only showed improvement in the hyaluronic acid group (P<0.05)
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Improvement in vaginal dryness	1677	1872	Improvement in urinary incontinence, dryness, maturation index (P<0.05) and composite score of vaginal symptoms (P<0.001) in the hyaluronic acid group was better than those in the Premarin group.
Hyaluronic acid	Conjugated estrogen (Premarin)	Vaginal pH	18605	18880	Also, studies showed that comparing the results of intra-group (before and after treatment), the amount of PH of both groups reduced, moving towards acidity (P<0.001) and no significant difference was obtained when the results of both groups were compared (P>0.05) (table 4).
