Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Self-reported STI symptoms	22968	23035	self-reported STI symptoms were similar in both sets of communities
Communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Communities that received standard Government services	HIV-1 incidence	1625	1843	Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Spatial mobility	21318	21712	T. vaginalis infection, secondary school education, and spatial mobility were more common in the control communities, whilst history of genital discharge and uptake of STI treatment and VCT services offered in the survey were low overall but more frequent in the intervention communities (Table 1). However, the differences in each case were small and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Self-reported STI symptoms	1102	1238	No evidence was found for reduced incidence of self-reported STI symptoms or high-risk sexual behaviour in the intervention communities.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	High-risk sexual behaviour	1102	1238	No evidence was found for reduced incidence of self-reported STI symptoms or high-risk sexual behaviour in the intervention communities.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Patients infected with T. vaginalis	21318	21712	T. vaginalis infection, secondary school education, and spatial mobility were more common in the control communities, whilst history of genital discharge and uptake of STI treatment and VCT services offered in the survey were low overall but more frequent in the intervention communities (Table 1). However, the differences in each case were small and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Genital discharge history	21318	21712	T. vaginalis infection, secondary school education, and spatial mobility were more common in the control communities, whilst history of genital discharge and uptake of STI treatment and VCT services offered in the survey were low overall but more frequent in the intervention communities (Table 1). However, the differences in each case were small and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	HIV/AIDS meeting attendance	25422	25682	More respondents in the intervention communities than in the control communities attended an HIV/AIDS meeting (41% versus 28%, prevalence rate ratio 1.44 [95% CI 1.33–1.56], p < 0.001) and a programme meeting (20% versus 5%, 4.27 [95% CI 3.52–5.17], p < 0.001)
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Programme meeting attendance	25217	25683	In the general population sample interviewed in the follow-up survey, 1,779 (35%) and 647 (13%) of 5,098 respondents reported attending an HIV/AIDS meeting and a programme meeting, respectively (Table 5). More respondents in the intervention communities than in the control communities attended an HIV/AIDS meeting (41% versus 28%, prevalence rate ratio 1.44 [95% CI 1.33–1.56], p < 0.001) and a programme meeting (20% versus 5%, 4.27 [95% CI 3.52–5.17], p < 0.001),
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	HIV/AIDS meeting attendance	-1	-1	More respondents in the intervention communities than in the control communities attended an HIV/AIDS meeting (41% versus 28%, prevalence rate ratio 1.44 [95% CI 1.33�??1.56], p < 0.001)
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Secondary school education	21318	21712	T. vaginalis infection, secondary school education, and spatial mobility were more common in the control communities, whilst history of genital discharge and uptake of STI treatment and VCT services offered in the survey were low overall but more frequent in the intervention communities (Table 1). However, the differences in each case were small and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Intake of STI treatment	21318	21712	T. vaginalis infection, secondary school education, and spatial mobility were more common in the control communities, whilst history of genital discharge and uptake of STI treatment and VCT services offered in the survey were low overall but more frequent in the intervention communities (Table 1). However, the differences in each case were small and were unlikely to be clinically meaningful.
Communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Communities that received standard Government services	HIV-1 incidence	-1	-1	Despite greater programme activity and knowledge in the intervention communities, the incidence rate ratio of HIV-1 was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92�??1.75) compared to the control communities.
Baseline communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Baseline communities that received standard Government services	Programme meeting attendance	25422	25682	More respondents in the intervention communities than in the control communities attended an HIV/AIDS meeting (41% versus 28%, prevalence rate ratio 1.44 [95% CI 1.33–1.56], p < 0.001) and a programme meeting (20% versus 5%, 4.27 [95% CI 3.52–5.17], p < 0.001)
Communities that received additional education and preventive measures	Communities that received standard Government services	HIV-1 prevalence	21161	21316	HIV-1 prevalence was higher in the intervention communities than in the control communities (24% versus 21%, risk ratio 1.13 [95% CI 1.05–1.22], p = 0.001)
