Lauroyl arginate‐containing mouthrinse 	Control	Whole‐mouth mean Plaque index score	22010	22404	After 4 weeks of use, the 0.15% LAE‐containing mouthrinse was associated with a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline in the whole‐mouth mean PI score compared with the control mouthrinse, with a between‐treatment difference in the least squares means of 1.23 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.07, 1.39), equating to a 42.6% greater reduction versus control (p < 0.001;
Lauroyl arginate‐containing mouthrinse 	Control	Adverse events related to oral soft tissue	25793	25896	No adverse events related to oral soft tissue were recorded during the study in either treatment group.
Lauroyl arginate‐containing mouthrinse 	Control	Whole‐mouth mean Bleeding Index score	24249	24455	the 0.15% LAE‐containing mouthrinse was associated with statistically significantly greater reductions from baseline in whole‐mouth mean BI score (p < 0.001) at both Weeks 2 and 4 compared with the control.
Lauroyl arginate‐containing mouthrinse 	Control	Proportion of bleeding sites	24456	24975	At Week 2, a 36.3% reduction in the proportion of bleeding sites was observed compared with the control group (0.077 versus 0.121; difference 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.06]). At Week 4, a 50.9% reduction in the proportion of bleeding sites was observed compared with the control group (0.058 versus 0.119; difference 0.06 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.08]). All bleeding scores were either 0 or 1 in both treatment groups across all study visits. Therefore, in this study, the mean scores were equivalent to proportions of bleeding sites
Lauroyl arginate‐containing mouthrinse 	Control	Whole‐mouth mean Modified Gingival Index score	22415	22626	The reduction in the whole‐mouth mean MGI score was also statistically significantly greater with the LAE mouthrinse (difference: 0.23 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.28]; 10.7% reduction compared with the control; p < 0.001).
