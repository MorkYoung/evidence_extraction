Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 	Formoterol/budesonide	Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score improvement at 28 weeks	1779	1959	However, in a post hoc logistic regression analyses for any AQLQ improvement, significant benefits with SAL/FP were seen at both time points (p = 0.038 and p = 0.009, respectively)
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 	Formoterol/budesonide	Symptom-free days	1258	1472	The percentage of symptom-free days was significantly greater (58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034) and the annual exacerbation rate was significantly lower (47%; p = 0.008) with stable-dose SAL/FP compared with FOR/BUD AMD.
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 	Formoterol/budesonide	Annual exacerbation rate	1258	1472	The percentage of symptom-free days was significantly greater (58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034) and the annual exacerbation rate was significantly lower (47%; p = 0.008) with stable-dose SAL/FP compared with FOR/BUD AMD.
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 	Formoterol/budesonide	Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score improvement at 52 weeks	1587	1778	The mean change from baseline in AQLQ overall score was numerically greater with SAL/FP than FOR/BUD at week 28 and week 52, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.121 at Week 52).
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 	Formoterol/budesonide	Symptom-free days	16703	16894	Stable dosing with SAL/FP resulted in a significantly higher percentage of symptom-free days compared with AMD with FOR/BUD over the whole 52-week treatment period (58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034)
