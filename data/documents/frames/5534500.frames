enhanced recovery	conventional recover	Complications	1352	1458	Complications were significantly lower among patients in the enhanced group (25.7% vs. 65.7%) (P = 0.001).
enhanced recovery	conventional recover	tolerated earlier oral feeding (fluids) without severe PONV	12641	12765	Similarly, patients in the en-hanced recovery group tolerated earlier oral feeding (fluids) without severe PONV (P < 0.001).
enhanced recovery	conventional recover	The times of removal of urinary catheters	12766	12849	The times of removal of urinary catheters were similar in the 2 groups (P = 0.202).
enhanced recovery	conventional recover	The mean postoperative hospital stay, the mean time of removal of NGTs, the mean time of successful enteral feeding, the mean time for removal of intra-abdominal drains 	899	1350	The mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.49 ± 0.85 days vs. 13.31 ± 6.9 days (P < 0.001), the mean time of removal of NGTs was 0.77 ± 1.031 days vs. 3.26 ± 2.737 days (P < 0.001), the mean time of successful enteral feeding was 1.89 ± 1.13 days vs. 5.46 ± 1.67 days (P < 0.001), and the mean time for removal of intra-abdominal drains was 2.94 ± 1.056 days vs. 9.06 ± 3.757 days (P < 0.001) for the enhanced and the conventional groups, respectively

enhanced recovery	conventional recover	compliant to enforced mobilization within 24 hours after surgery	12417	12640	Patients in the enhanced recovery group were compliant to enforced mobilization within 24 hours after surgery (POD 0) while only five patients in the control group were ambulated successfully within that period (P < 0.001).
enhanced recovery	conventional recover	wound infection, respiratory tract infections, and anastomotic leak	13903	14176	Regarding postoperative complications, patients in the enhanced recovery group had lower incidences of complications some of which were statistically significant, such as wound infection (P < 0.001), respiratory tract infections (P = 0.025) and anastomotic leak (P = 0.05).
