phytosterols (PS), ezetimibe (EZ)	high fat (HF) diet	plasma concentrations of CE-16:0, CE-18:1, and CE-18:2	8184	8337	Dietary PS and EZ supplementation resulted in similar reductions (p < 0.05) in plasma concentrations of CE-16:0, CE-18:1, and CE-18:2 versus the HF group
phytosterols (PS),	ezetimibe (EZ), high fat (HF) diet	campesterol and sitosterol	8351	8486	PS feeding led to an expected increase (p < 0.05) in RBC campesterol and sitosterol concentrations compared with the HF and EZ groups (
phytosterols (PS), ezetimibe (EZ)	high fat (HF) diet	plasma concentrations of CE-16:0, CE-18:1, and CE-18:2	8184	8350	Dietary PS and EZ supplementation resulted in similar reductions (p < 0.05) in plasma concentrations of CE-16:0, CE-18:1, and CE-18:2 versus the HF group (Figure 1E).
phytosterols (PS), ezetimibe (EZ)	high fat (HF) diet	Blood triglycerides (TG) concentrations	1031	1149	Blood TG concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) in the PS (49%) and EZ (68%)-treated animals compared with the HF group.
phytosterols (PS),	ezetimibe (EZ), high fat (HF) diet	campesterol and sitosterol	8351	8586	PS feeding led to an expected increase (p < 0.05) in RBC campesterol and sitosterol concentrations compared with the HF and EZ groups (Figure 2) but also reduced (p < 0.05) RBC desmosterol concentrations compared with the other groups.
phytosterols (PS), ezetimibe (EZ)	high fat (HF) diet	intestinal cholesterol absorption, blood non-HDL cholesterol, and hepatic cholesterol	722	1030	In confirmation of diet formulation and compound delivery, both the PS and EZ treatments lowered (p < 0.05) intestinal cholesterol absorption (24 and 31%, respectively), blood non-HDL cholesterol (61 and 66%, respectively), and hepatic cholesterol (45 and 55%, respectively) compared with the HF-fed animals.
