experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	sleep percentage effects among patients with schizophrenia	954	1212	A significant effect of acupuncture treatment was observed for seven objective sleep variables: sleep onset latency, sleep percentage, mean activity level, wake time after sleep onset, mean number of wake episodes, mean wake episode and longest wake episode.
experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	mean activity level among patients with schizophrenia	18835	19022	a significant reduction was found in mean activity level (t(18) = 3.2, P < 0.01). Following acupuncture treatment, participants were less active during sleep compared to baseline measures
experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	total wake minutes during sleep among patients with schizophrenia	11853	12372	The study began with a seven-day running-in, treatment-as-usual period, followed by an eight-week experimental period. During the experimental period, participants were treated with acupuncture twice a week, for a total sequential acupuncture treatment comprising 16 sessions. During the first week of the study (treatment-as-usual period) and the last week of the experimental period, participants' sleep was continuously monitored with a wrist actigraph, and participants completed a broad spectrum of questionnaires.

experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	total wake minutes during sleep among patients with schizophrenia	19092	19274	A significant difference was also found in total wake minutes (Figure 1(d)) (t(18) = 2.92, P < 0.01), indicating fewer total wake minutes during sleep following acupuncture treatment
experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	total wake minutes during sleep among patients with schizophrenia	19092	19353	A significant difference was also found in total wake minutes (Figure 1(d)) (t(18) = 2.92, P < 0.01), indicating fewer total wake minutes during sleep following acupuncture treatment (M = 46.58, SD = 32.64) compared to baseline measures (M = 67.43, SD = 45.86).
experimental period - acupuncture	treatment as usual period	sleep latency effects among patients with schizophrenia	954	1212	A significant effect of acupuncture treatment was observed for seven objective sleep variables: sleep onset latency, sleep percentage, mean activity level, wake time after sleep onset, mean number of wake episodes, mean wake episode and longest wake episode.
