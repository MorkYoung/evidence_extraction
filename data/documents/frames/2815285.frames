Lactated Ringer (group II) and hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	No treatment (group I)	Improvement in hemodynamic variables	22938	23224	After fluid resuscitation, a significant increase in CI was observed in LR- and HSD-treated animals (T45) when compared with the NT group (* p<0.05 NT vs. LR and HSD) (panel B). The mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were similar to the cardiac index.
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III) and no treatment (group I)	Transcapillary refill	25201	25366	In addition, LR-treated animals had negative TR values, indicating transcapillary leaks, while HSD-treated animals had significantly increased transcapillary refill.
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	Blood volume in the retroperitoneal hematoma	24363	24550	Significantly higher VRPH was observed in LR-treated animals when compared to the HSD group, indicating more pronounced rebleeding (p<0.05 NT vs. LR and HSD; p<0.05 LR vs. HSD) (panel C).
Lactated Ringer (group II) and hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	No treatment (group I)	Improvement in hemodynamic variables	23323	23547	After fluid resuscitation occurred, there was an initial decrease in the Htc in treated groups (from T30 to T45), which was similar in all groups from T45 to T75 (panel C). The hemoglobin level was similar to the hematocrit.
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III) and no treatment (group I)	Transcapillary refill	24961	25366	Transcapillary refill increased in all groups during hemorrhage. Fluid resuscitation determined plateaus in the NT group. It increased in HSD-treated animals and decreased significantly in the LR group (p<0.05 NT and HSD vs. LR) (panel E). In addition, LR-treated animals had negative TR values, indicating transcapillary leaks, while HSD-treated animals had significantly increased transcapillary refill.
Lactated Ringer (group II) and hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	No treatment (group I)	Improvement in hemodynamic variables	994	1308	Volume replacement produced transitory recovery in hemodynamic variables, including mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index, with significant increase in dogs treated with 32 mL/kg of Lactated Ringer's and 7.5% NaCl plus 6.0% dextran 70 (p<0.001, against no treatment),
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	Circulating red cell volume	23959	24154	Fluid resuscitation with subsequent rebleeding led to a decrease in CBV in both treatment groups, although changes were more pronounced in LR-treated animals (p<0.05 NT vs. LR; p<0.05 LR vs. HSD)
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III) and no treatment (group I)	Transcapillary refill	25026	25200	Fluid resuscitation determined plateaus in the NT group. It increased in HSD-treated animals and decreased significantly in the LR group (p<0.05 NT and HSD vs. LR) (panel E).
Lactated Ringer (group II) 	Hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	Blood volume in the retroperitoneal hematoma	24363	24539	Significantly higher VRPH was observed in LR-treated animals when compared to the HSD group, indicating more pronounced rebleeding (p<0.05 NT vs. LR and HSD; p<0.05 LR vs. HSD)
