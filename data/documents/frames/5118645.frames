oxycodone (OXY) 60mg oral	eluxadoline 100, 300, and 1000 mg	mean Emax scores	16750	17385	Mean (±S.D.) Emax scores were close to neutral (50.0) following oral eluxadoline administration (100 mg: 56.8 ± 13.7; 300 mg: 58.7 ± 13.4; 1000 mg: 60.0 ± 14.8), with minimal mean increases (<5 points) with increasing eluxadoline dose (Table 2). Median differences compared with placebo were significant only for eluxadoline 300 and 1000 mg (P < 0.05 versus placebo for both doses). Mean Emax scores were between 25 and 35 points lower with eluxadoline compared with oxycodone, with median Emax scores being significantly higher for both doses of oxycodone compared with all eluxadoline doses (P < 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons).
