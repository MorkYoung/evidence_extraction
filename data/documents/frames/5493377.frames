Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Pain	998	1198	Pain reduced in both groups following treatment (AT+EX: p<0.001, partial η2 = 0.55; ST+EX: p = 0.026, partial η2 = 0.18) but no between-group differences were observed (p = 0.18, partial η2 = 0.08). F
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Function 	1197	1398	Function improved in the AT+EX (p = 0.01, partial η2 = 0.22), but not the ST+EX (p = 0.16, partial η2 = 0.08) group, between-group differences did not reach significance (p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.052).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Function 	1197	1397	Function improved in the AT+EX (p = 0.01, partial η2 = 0.22), but not the ST+EX (p = 0.16, partial η2 = 0.08) group, between-group differences did not reach significance (p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.052)
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Conditioned pain modulation	1575	1689	CPM only improved in the AT+EX group but no between-group difference was observed (p = 0.054, partial η2 = 0.158).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Pain	998	1196	Pain reduced in both groups following treatment (AT+EX: p<0.001, partial η2 = 0.55; ST+EX: p = 0.026, partial η2 = 0.18) but no between-group differences were observed (p = 0.18, partial η2 = 0.08).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Nociceptive flexor withdrawal reflex	21216	21307	No within- or between-group differences were found for any other measure, including the NFR
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Pressure pain thresholds improvement	1399	1574	AT+EX produced greater improvements in PPTs than ST+EX (p<0.05) (superolateral knee: partial η2 = 0.17; superior knee: partial η2 = 0.3; superomedial knee: partial η2 = 0.26).
Transcranial direct current stimulation	Control	Pressure pain thresholds improvement	20379	20620	PPTs increased (i.e. a greater amount of pressure was required to be perceived as painful) to a greater extent in the AT+EX group for the superolateral, superior, and superomedial knee sites when compared with the ST+EX group (ANCOVA: p<0.05
