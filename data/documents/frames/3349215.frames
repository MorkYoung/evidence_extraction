Linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation	Control	VAS pain score after therapy 	1039	1179	There was a significant difference between the test and control groups immediately after therapy (P < 0.05), while no effect 6 months later.
Linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation	Control	Thermal injuries 	7833	7901	No thermal injury or other complications were observed in the study.
Linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation	Control	VAS pain score after 6 months	918	1179	In both groups, the pain intensity (VAS score) decreased significantly immediately after therapy as compared to therapy. There was a significant difference between the test and control groups immediately after therapy (P < 0.05), while no effect 6 months later.
Linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation	Control	VAS pain score after 6 months	7559	7709	There was no significant difference in the effect at the point of 6 months after therapy that nearly reached the same levels at pretherapy (P > 0.05).
Linear-polarized near-infrared light irradiation	Control	Overall complications 	7833	7901	No thermal injury or other complications were observed in the study.
