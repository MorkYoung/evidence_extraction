D1 (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief®)	control	carbon, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium	16965	17217	In the analysis of the chemical composition of Group 1 samples, a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) was verified between the control's and experimental's surfaces, mainly with respect to carbon, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium.
G3- brushing with Sensodyne®Repair & Protect;	control	oxygen; carbon; calcium; nitrogen; phosphorus; silicon and sodium	18079	18369	By checking the chemical elements of specimens from Group 3, a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the positive and the experimental control regions for all chemical elements present in oxygen; carbon; calcium; nitrogen; phosphorus; silicon and sodium, samples was noticed
G2- brushing with Sensodyne®Rapid Relief;	control	carbon, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and strontium	17793	18078	These data are corroborated taking into account the formulation of Sensodyne Rapid Relief® dentifrice (8% strontium acetate, calcium carbonate, sodium fluoride; 1,040 ppm fluoride), and the clear deposition of obliterating particles in the dentinal tubules of the experimental regions.
D1 (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief®), dentifrice D3 (Sensodyne Repair & Protect®)	D2 (Sensodyne Rapid Relief®), D4 (Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection®)	colloidal stability	13516	13722	. Zeta potential analysis shows better colloidal stability in solution for dentifrice D1 (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief®) and dentifrice D3 (Sensodyne Repair & Protect®) (p <0.05) when compared to D2 and D4.
G3- brushing with Sensodyne®Repair & Protect;	control	oxygen; carbon; calcium; nitrogen; phosphorus; silicon and sodium	18079	18697	By checking the chemical elements of specimens from Group 3, a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the positive and the experimental control regions for all chemical elements present in oxygen; carbon; calcium; nitrogen; phosphorus; silicon and sodium, samples was noticed, which is solidified by the dentifrice chemical composition (5% calcium phosphosilicate and sodium and 1426 ppm fluoride) and by the reduction in the diameter of dentinal tubules in the experimental part when compared to the control, besides the formation of a layer over the dentin, as verified in the SEM images from Group 3.
G2- brushing with Sensodyne®Rapid Relief;	control	carbon, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and strontium	17530	17792	Evaluation regarding the chemical elements present in the specimen from Group 2 shows a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) in the experimental faces when comparing to the positive control faces for carbon, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and strontium.
D1 (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief®), dentifrice D3 (Sensodyne Repair & Protect®)	D2 (Sensodyne Rapid Relief®), D4 (Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection®)	colloidal stability	13518	13790	Zeta potential analysis shows better colloidal stability in solution for dentifrice D1 (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief®) and dentifrice D3 (Sensodyne Repair & Protect®) (p <0.05) when compared to D2 and D4. D2 and D4 are statistically similar with regards to this parameter.
