Dexmedetomidine	fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusion (SD0)	Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV)	1791	1843	Dexmedetomidine infusion did not affect PPV and SVV.
propofol SD1 and SD2	fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusion (SD0)	Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV)	1643	1744	, both PPV and SVV significantly increased in SD1 versus SD0 (P < 0.01) and SD2 versus SD0 (P < 0.001
propofol SD1 and SD2	Dexmedetomidine 	Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV)	1844	1924	At SD1 and SD2, PPV and SVV were higher in PROP with respect to DEX (P < 0.001).
propofol SD2	propofol SD1	Pulse pressure variation (PPV) 	1609	1789	At the increasing dose of propofol, both PPV and SVV significantly increased in SD1 versus SD0 (P < 0.01) and SD2 versus SD0 (P < 0.001), but only PPV in SD2 versus SD1 (P = 0.024)
propofol SD1 and SD2	fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusion (SD0)	Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV)	1609	1746	At the increasing dose of propofol, both PPV and SVV significantly increased in SD1 versus SD0 (P < 0.01) and SD2 versus SD0 (P < 0.001),
