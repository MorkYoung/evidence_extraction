evacetrapib (10–600 mg)	placebo	Apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B)	837	1026	At the highest dose (600 mg), evacetrapib significantly inhibited CETP activity (91%), increased HDL-C (87%) and apo AI (42%), and decreased LDL-C (29%) and apo B (26%) relative to placebo.

evacetrapib (10–600 mg)	placebo	low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)	19459	19529	decreased LDL by 28.6% (P < 0.001 vs placebo) from baseline to Day 14.
evacetrapib (10–600 mg)	placebo	Apolipoprotein AI (apo AI)	24540	24666	The increase in apo AI and decreases in apo B and ratio of apo B to apo AI were significant at all dose levels of evacetrapib.
