gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	Preoperative mechanical alignment - varus	15996	16100	Preoperative mechanical alignment was 5.2° ± 4.5° varus in the GB group and 5.4° ± 4.8° in the MR group.
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	With survival for any reason	16804	17008	With survival for any reason as the endpoint of interest, survival rates were 93.7% (95% CI, 86.4% and 97.1%) and 89.8% (95% CI, 81.9% - 94.4%) for the GB group and the MR group, respectively (p = 0.302).
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	3° deviation from neutral alignment	16182	16314	In the GB and the MR group, there were 23 and 35 knees with more than 3° deviation from neutral alignment, respectively (p = 0.061),
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	3° deviation from neutral alignment	16180	16314	. In the GB and the MR group, there were 23 and 35 knees with more than 3° deviation from neutral alignment, respectively (p = 0.061),
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	With survival for any reason	1338	1563	Implant survival rates at 10 years, with survival for any reason as the endpoint of interest, were 93.7% (95% CI, 86.4% and 97.1%) and 89.8% (95% CI, 81.9% - 94.4%) for the GB group and the MR group, respectively (p = 0.302).
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	Knee Society Knee Score (KS) 10 years postoperatively using the two one-sided test (TOST)	1012	1218	Mean KS was 82 (95% confidence interval (CI), 80 – 83) and 77 (95% CI, 76 – 79) in the GB and MR group, respectively. The TOST test and linear mixed model both revealed statistical significance (p < 0.001).
gap balancing (GB) technique	measured resection (MR)	With survival for aseptic reasons	16602	16803	With survival for aseptic reasons as the endpoint of interest, survival rates were 94.6% (95% CI, 87.5% and 97.7%) and 91.6% (84.0% - 95.7%) for the GB group and the MR group, respectively (p = 0.386).
