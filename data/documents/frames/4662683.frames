early initiation group (3 days after stroke) with swallowing therapy 	(2) medium group (2 weeks after stroke); and (3) late group (1-month after stroke) with swallowing therapy 	recovery	1297	1492	Onset time of swallowing therapy after stroke was effective on swallowing recovery on the main outcome variables. So that in first group patients, recovery was rather than other groups P < 0.050.
