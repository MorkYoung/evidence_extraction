Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)	baseline	responder rate in the subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel syndrome onset	1115	1278	The best response was observed in the subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel syndrome onset (Δ 45.7% points, p = 0.029).
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)	placebo	responder rate in the subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel syndrome onset	856	1278	Altogether, the responder rate was higher in the EcN than in the placebo group. However, only after 10 and 11 weeks, the differences were significant (Δ 20.0% points [95% CI 2.6; 37.4], p = 0.01 and Δ 18.3% points [95% CI 1.0; 35.7], p = 0.02, respectively). The best response was observed in the subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel syndrome onset (Δ 45.7% points, p = 0.029).
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)	placebo	responder rate	-1	-1	At the end of the study, the difference between the groups (EcN 53.3%, placebo 41.7%) was 11.6% ([−6.1; 29.4]) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10).Fig. 2
