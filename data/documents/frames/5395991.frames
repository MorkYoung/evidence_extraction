internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique	ILM peeling	The primary macular hole closure rates	10997	11088	The primary macular hole closure rates were 100% in group 1 and 55.5% in group 2 (P=0.056).
internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique	ILM peeling	The primary reattachment rate	11211	11294	The primary reattachment rates were 100% in group 1 and 55.5% in group 2 (P=0.056).
internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique	ILM peeling	The primary reattachment rate	1887	2015	The primary macular hole closure and reattachment rates were not significantly different in both groups (P=0.056, respectively).
internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique	ILM peeling	The final reattachment rate	10117	10356	Group 1 included 6 eyes of 6 patients in whom vitrectomy combined with the inverted ILM flap technique was performed, and group 2 included 9 eyes of 9 patients in whom vitrectomy combined with ILM peeling for MHRD was performed (Figure 1).
internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique	ILM peeling	The final reattachment rate	11295	11376	The final reattachment rates were 100% in group 1 and 88.8% in group 2 (P=0.398).
