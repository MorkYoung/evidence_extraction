group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	bradycardia	1860	1999	Although significant bradycardia was noted in group D (23% of patients) during the procedure (P = 0.02), no cases were reported in group M.
group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	the time of the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay	1734	1859	the time of PACU stay was significantly less (P < 0.01) in group D (49.03 ± 12.8 min) compared to group M (62.5 ± 18.34 min).
group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	the time of the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay	15711	15935	Although the difference in the duration of the procedure was insignificant between groups (P = 0.46), PACU stay was significantly shorter (P < 0.01) in group D (49.03 ± 12.8 min) than in group M (62.5 ± 18.34 min) [Table 5].
group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	Intraoperative rescue sedation by propofol and postoperative rescue analgesia by acetaminophen	1544	1720	Intraoperative rescue sedation by propofol and postoperative rescue analgesia by acetaminophen showed a highly significant decrease (P < 0.01) in group D compared with group M.
group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	Intraoperative rescue sedation by propofol and postoperative rescue analgesia by acetaminophen	15221	15502	Rescue sedation in the form of propofol 0.25 mg/kg was administered in both groups when required. A highly significant decrease (P < 0.01) in the total amount of propofol used during the procedure was evident in group D (median = 55 mg) in comparison with group M (median = 150 mg)
group (D) received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1 μg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 μg/kg/h infusion until Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) reached 3–4	group (M) received a loading dose of midazolam 0.06 mg/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3–4	bradycardia	16183	16372	We observed six cases in group D (23%) who developed bradycardia (HR < 50 beats/min) during the procedure, which was statistically significant (P = 0.02) when compared to group M [Table 6].
