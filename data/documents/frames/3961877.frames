oral glutamine suspension daily 2h before radiation in the study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water)	nothing before radiation	number of patients who developed grade 3 mucositis and grade 4 mucositis	10879	11393	Regarding the severity of mucositis, though there is no statistically significant difference in number of patients who developed grade 1 and grade 2 mucositis, but the number of patients who developed grade 3 mucositis (14.29%) and grade 4 mucositis (2.86%) in the study arm (who received oral glutamine) was significantly less (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively) as compared to the control arm (37.14% patients developed grade 3 mucositis and 17.14% patients developed grade 4 mucositis) [Table 2 and Figure 1].
oral glutamine suspension daily 2h before radiation in the study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water)	nothing before radiation	Grade 3 or worse mucositis	12699	12921	Grade 3 or worse mucositis was seen in 52% (13 out of 25 face and neck irradiation) in the control arm. However, the same was seen much less in the glutamine arm (20.83%) (5 out of 24 face and neck irradiation) (P = 0.01).
oral glutamine suspension daily 2h before radiation in the study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water)	nothing before radiation	Grade 3 or worse mucositis	1135	1322	Grade 3 mucositis (14.29%) and grade 4 mucositis (2.86%) in the study arm (who received oral glutamine) were significantly less (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively) in the glutamine arm.
oral glutamine suspension daily 2h before radiation in the study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water)	nothing before radiation	the mean time to onset of mucositis	1467	1601	. Mean time of onset of mucositis was significantly delayed in patients who took glutamine in comparison to control arm with P < 0.001
oral glutamine suspension daily 2h before radiation in the study arm (10 g in 1000 ml of water)	nothing before radiation	the mean time to onset of mucositis	11758	12008	As evidenced from Table 4, the mean time to onset of mucositis was significantly earlier in the control arm who did not receive glutamine as compared to study arm (who received glutamine) with P < 0.001;thus, glutamine delayed the onset of mucositis.
