Vasovagal syncope	Control	Average R-R intervals SD	10852	10945	. The value of SDNN and RMSSD significantly increased in patient group (P=0.009 and P=0.000).
Vasovagal syncope	Control	Root mean square of the successive differences	1012	1606	Student t test indicated significantly higher SNDD values (60.46 ms vs. 37.42 ms, P=0.003) and RMSSD (57.90 ms vs. 26.92 ms, P=0.000) in the patient group than in the control group. In the patient group, RMSSD (80.41 ms vs. 45.89 ms, P=0.015) and normalized HF (61.18 ms vs. 43.19 ms, P=0.022) were significantly higher in adolescents, whereas normalized LF (38.81 ms vs. 56.76 ms, P=0.022) and LF/HF ratio (0.76 vs. 1.89, P=0.041) were significantly lower in adolescents. In contrast, the control group did not have significant differences in HRV values between adolescents and preadolescents.
Vasovagal syncope	Control	Root mean square of the successive differences	8995	9159	The statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the median SNDD and RMSSD values in the patient group compared to the control group (P=0.003 and P=0.000).
Vasovagal syncope	Control	Average R-R intervals SD	1012	1193	Student t test indicated significantly higher SNDD values (60.46 ms vs. 37.42 ms, P=0.003) and RMSSD (57.90 ms vs. 26.92 ms, P=0.000) in the patient group than in the control group.
