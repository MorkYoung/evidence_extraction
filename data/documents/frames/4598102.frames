Adjunctive aripiprazole	No additional treatment	Prolactin levels in serum	15102	15295	serum levels of prolactin were significantly lower in the aripiprazole group compared with the control group after taking into account baseline values at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (P< 0.001) (Fig 2).
Adjunctive aripiprazole	No additional treatment	Changes in levels of lipids (except low density lipoproteins) or fasting glucose	1645	1849	There were no significant differences in changes of Fasting Plasma Glucose, Total cholesterol, Triglycerides and High Density Lipoprotein within each group at week 4 and 8 execpt low density lipoproteins.
Adjunctive aripiprazole	No additional treatment	PANSS-total scores at week 4 and 8	993	1300	One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled in this study, and 107 patients completed the study (54 in the aripiprazole group, and 53 in the control group).

Adjunctive aripiprazole	No additional treatment	PANSS-negative scores at week 4 and 8	1301	1454	PANSS-negative scores in the aripiprazole group also decreased significantly at week 4 (P = 0.005) and week 8 (P< 0.001) compared with the control group.
Adjunctive aripiprazole	No additional treatment	PANSS-total scores at week 4 and 8	1154	1300	PANSS-total scores in the aripiprazole group decreased significantly at week 4 (P = 0.003) and week 8 (P = 0.007) compared with the control group.
