group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	wall motion score - patients undergoing CABG / CE	1298	1553	Since warfarin has serious hemorrhagic complications and requires closed monitoring of serum drug activity by serial INR checking, it is recommended that clopidogrel – aspirin can be the preferred alternative anticoagulation therapy in CABG / CE patients.
group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	gender - patients undergoing CABG / CE	8552	8639	According to sex, there was no statistically significant difference between two groups.
group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	mean ICU stay - patients undergoing CABG / CE	8946	9100	The mean ICU stay was 4.6±1.9 days in clopidogrel group and 4.63±1.29 days in warfarin group. This difference was not statistically significant (P=0.949).
group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	wall motion score - patients undergoing CABG / CE	1143	1273	owever, wall mrotion score was significantly better in clopidogrel – aspirin patients in late (3 months) post operation (p<0.001).
group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	mean hospital stay - patients undergoing CABG / CE	9101	9211	The mean hospital stay was 9.07±3.29 days in clopidogrel group and 9.26±1.93 days in warfarin group (p=0.820).
group 1, the patients were given warfarin (INR) between 2-3) together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	In group 2, the patients were given 75 mg plavix (clopidogrel) daily together with 80 mg aspirin daily for 3 months	mean age - patients undergoing CABG / CE	8393	8551	The mean age in clopidogrel – aspirin group was 62.9±9.85 years and in warfarin – aspirin group was 58.86±11.42 years. This was not statistically significant.
