Enalapril	Hydralazine	Amount of PAX2+/p-ERK+-positive cells	25787	26212	The number of double-positive PAX2+/p-ERK+ cells per Bowman's capsule cross section increased along Bowman's capsule in untreated (0.86±0.13 vs. 0, p < 0.001, normal) and in hydralazine-treated mice with FSGS (0.75±0.13, p < 0.001 vs. normal) at day 7. Enalapril further increased the number of PAX2+/p-ERK+-positive cells approximately two-fold at day 7 (1.40±0.16, p < 0.01 vs. hydralazine-treated FSGS mice) (Figure 8(f)).
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Decrease in blood pressure 	17057	17374	The decrease in systolic BP and diastolic BP was similar in FSGS mice treated with hydralazine and enalapril on day 4 (111/66 mmHg, enalapril; 118/75 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05), day 6 (101/63 mmHg, enalapril; 114/77 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05) and day 13 (90/58 mmHg, enalapril; 97/66 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05).
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Glomerulosclerosis at day 14	979	1089	Both glomerulosclerosis and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio were less in the ACE-inhibition arm at day 14.
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio at day 14	18535	18669	Moreover, at this time point, enalapril also lowered the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (393.4 ug/mg vs. 770.3 ug/mg, p = 0.034).
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio at day 14	979	1089	Both glomerulosclerosis and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio were less in the ACE-inhibition arm at day 14.
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Podocyte proliferation	1411	1473	Podocyte proliferation did not occur at any time in any group.
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Amount of PAX2+/p-ERK+-positive cells	-1	-1	Enalapril further increased the number of PAX2+/p-ERK+-positive cells approximately two-fold at day 7 (1.40±0.16, p < 0.01 vs. hydralazine-treated FSGS mice) (Figure 8(f)).At day 14 of FSGS, the number of PAX2+/p-ERK+ cells increased along Bowman's capsule in untreated mice (1.04±0.16 per Bowman's capsule cross section, p < 0.001 vs. normal) and hydralazine treated mice with FSGS (1.03±0.13, p < 0.001 vs. normal) (Figure 8(f)). This was further increased by enalapril (1.46±0.19, p < 0.05, vs. hydralazine).
Enalapril	Hydralazine	Decrease in blood pressure 	17057	17470	The decrease in systolic BP and diastolic BP was similar in FSGS mice treated with hydralazine and enalapril on day 4 (111/66 mmHg, enalapril; 118/75 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05), day 6 (101/63 mmHg, enalapril; 114/77 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05) and day 13 (90/58 mmHg, enalapril; 97/66 mmHg, hydralazine, p > 0.05). These data show a similar BP-lowering effect with hydralazine and enalapril in this FSGS model.
