Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Forced vital capacity	15197	15302	whereas the ALSFRS-R and FVC (%) deteriorated without significant differences between the two treatments.
Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Appel ALS rating scale slope speed	14998	15195	The slope of AALSRS was 1.63 points/month slower while the patients were treated with oral solubilized UDCA than with placebo (2.24 vs 3.88 points/month, 95% CI for difference 0.60-2.68, P = 0.004)

Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	ALS functional rating scale	14802	14906	, the slope of neither ALSFRS-R nor FVC (%) did not show any significant differences between treatments.
Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Time to a 20-points progression in the AALSRS	15788	16062	As for the PP' datasets, the time to a 20-points progression in the AALSRS total score was estimated to be delayed by 14.9 months in oral solubilized UDCA-treated group compared to placebo-treated group (22.5 vs 7.6 months, 95% CI for difference 2.97-26.8 months, P = 0.018)
Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Forced vital capacity	904	1152	The slope of AALSRS was 1.17 points/month lower while the patients were treated with UDCA than with placebo (95% CI for difference 0.08-2.26, P = 0.037), whereas the slopes of ALSFRS-R and FVC did not show significant differences between treatments
Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Gastrointestinal adverse events	1154	1224	Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with UDCA (P < 0.05).
Ursodeoxycholic acid	Placebo	Appel ALS rating scale slope speed	904	1153	The slope of AALSRS was 1.17 points/month lower while the patients were treated with UDCA than with placebo (95% CI for difference 0.08-2.26, P = 0.037), whereas the slopes of ALSFRS-R and FVC did not show significant differences between treatments.
