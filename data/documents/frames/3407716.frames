drain group	no-drain group	mean fluid accumulation on day 1	924	1116	There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery
resected glands above 36.5 cm	resected glands below 36.5 cm	no-drain group fluid accumulation	14149	14262	The no-drain group also showed significantly more fluid accumulation in resected glands above 36.5 cm (P = 0.012)
resected glands above 36.5 cm	resected glands below 36.5 cm	no-drain group fluid accumulation	14149	14309	The no-drain group also showed significantly more fluid accumulation in resected glands above 36.5 cm (P = 0.012) [3] (the median size of glands in this study).
drain group	no-drain group	mean fluid accumulation on day 2	11946	12199	At both measured time points, fluid accumulation in the drain group was significantly less than in the no-drain group (16.4 ± 9.3 ml versus 25.1 ± 17.7 ml, P = 0.005; and 18.4 ± 9.9 ml versus 25.7 ± 18.6 ml, P = 0.026, at 24 and 48 hours, respectively).
drain group	no-drain group	mean fluid accumulation on day 1	924	1117	There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery.
drain group	no-drain group	infections	1284	1424	There were four versus one wound infections in the drain versus no-drain groups. This finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.154).
total thyroidectomy	completion thyroidectomy	no-drain group fluid accumulation	13905	14148	However, the no-drain group showed a significantly increased fluid accumulation following total thyroidectomy (P = 0.021) and significantly less following completion thyroidectomy (P = 0.026) compared with the other types of surgery performed.
total thyroidectomy	completion thyroidectomy	no-drain group fluid accumulation	13914	14147	the no-drain group showed a significantly increased fluid accumulation following total thyroidectomy (P = 0.021) and significantly less following completion thyroidectomy (P = 0.026) compared with the other types of surgery performed
drain group	no-drain group	mean fluid accumulation on day 2	924	1116	There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery
