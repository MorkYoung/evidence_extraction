Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Adverse events	1779	1838	No adverse effects related to study products were observed.
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Adverse events	19142	19295	During the study, six AEs were recorded (2 in placebo and 4 in RMD groups). None of the AEs were related to the study products nor classified as serious.
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Baseline characteristics and diet	-1	-1	The two study groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, and no significant difference was found in any of the variables between groups.
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Colonic transit time	16677	16913	The total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT were significantly decreased in the RMD group after intervention compared to baseline (p < 0.004, p < 0.008 and p < 0.006, respectively), while no decrease was found in the placebo group.
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Left SCTT	16677	17059	The total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT were significantly decreased in the RMD group after intervention compared to baseline (p < 0.004, p < 0.008 and p < 0.006, respectively), while no decrease was found in the placebo group. There are significant differences observed between groups regarding the total CTT and left SCTT (p < 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively; Table 2).
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Baseline characteristics and diet	-1	-1	The two study groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, and no significant difference was found in any of the variables between groups. The mean daily fibre intake was 10.0 ± 4.6 g in the RMD group and 11.5 ± 4.6 g in the placebo group. Overall, no significant differences in the diet were observed between groups.
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Colonic transit time	16677	17059	The total CTT, left SCTT and rectosigmoidal SCTT were significantly decreased in the RMD group after intervention compared to baseline (p < 0.004, p < 0.008 and p < 0.006, respectively), while no decrease was found in the placebo group. There are significant differences observed between groups regarding the total CTT and left SCTT (p < 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively; Table 2).
Digestion-resistant maltodextrin	Placebo	Improvement in faeces consistency 	1714	1777	Stool consistency was improved only in the RMD group (p < 0.01)
