lidocaine gel (2%)	placebo	On average (median) pain in the paediatric population	-1	-1	On average (median) pain has been reduced by 2.0/5 (verum) versus 1.2/5 (placebo) (Table 3). Nonparametric analysis (Mann-Whitney�??�??U test) of treatment related difference in pain assessment yielded a statistical significance (p < 0.001)
lidocaine gel (2%)	placebo	pain in the paediatric population	13015	13183	The observed ratings consequently showed statistically significant reduction of pain (Wilcoxon signed rank test results; T2: p value < 0.0001 and T3: p value < 0.0001).
lidocaine gel (2%)	placebo	On average (median) pain in the paediatric population	11397	11799	On average (median) pain has been reduced by 2.0/5 (verum) versus 1.2/5 (placebo) (Table 3). Nonparametric analysis (Mann-Whitney  U test) of treatment related difference in pain assessment yielded a statistical significance (p < 0.001) of the observed effect in favour of the 2% lidocaine gel (verum). A similar result (p < 0.002) was achieved also for the measurement of pain reduction from T1 to T3.
lidocaine gel (2%)	placebo	pain in the paediatric population	993	1211	. In group I, pain was reduced significantly after treatment with verum compared to placebo at both time points. In group II, the individual pain rating shift showed statistically significant lower pain after treatment
