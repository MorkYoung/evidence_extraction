Fimasartan	Atenolol	Transcranial Doppler pulsatility index 	1239	1369	The pulsatility index on transcranial Doppler was significantly reduced in valsartan (p = 0.002) and fimasartan group (p = 0.008).
Fimasartan	Atenolol	N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide 	1370	1539	Plasma NT-proBNP level was also significantly decreased in ARB groups, especially for the fimasartan group (37.8 ± 50.6 vs. 29.2 ± 36.9 vs.19.2 ± 27.8 pg/mL; p = 0.006).
Filmasartan	Atenolol	Central systolic blood pressure	952	1238	significantly lower central systolic BP (atenolol; 146.5 ± 18.8 vs. valsartan; 133.5 ± 20.7 vs. fimasartan; 133.6 ± 19.8 mmHg, p = 0.017) and augmentation index values (89.8 ± 13.2 vs. 80.6 ± 9.2 vs. 79.2 ± 11.6%; p = 0.001) were seen in the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) groups.
Valsartan	Atenolol	Central systolic blood pressure	952	1238	significantly lower central systolic BP (atenolol; 146.5 ± 18.8 vs. valsartan; 133.5 ± 20.7 vs. fimasartan; 133.6 ± 19.8 mmHg, p = 0.017) and augmentation index values (89.8 ± 13.2 vs. 80.6 ± 9.2 vs. 79.2 ± 11.6%; p = 0.001) were seen in the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) groups.
Valsartan	Atenolol	Central systolic blood pressure	-1	-1	Regardless of similar brachial blood pressure (BP) reduction (a), central systolic BP and central pulse pressure (b) showed significant difference in ARB groups.
Valsartan	Atenolol	Transcranial Doppler pulsatility index 	-1	-1	The pulsatility index on transcranial Doppler (c) after 12 weeks was significantly reduced in valsartan (p = 0.002) and fimasartan groups (p = 0.008). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
Valsartan	Atenolol	Transcranial Doppler pulsatility index 	1239	1369	The pulsatility index on transcranial Doppler was significantly reduced in valsartan (p = 0.002) and fimasartan group (p = 0.008).
