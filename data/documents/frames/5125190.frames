lignocaine group	methylprednisolone group	pain	8273	8448	The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% (64.2%–77.6%) in the saline group, 30.9% (21.2%–40.6%) in the lignocaine group, and 36.4% (31.5%–41.3%) in the methylprednisolone group
methylprednisolone group	saline group	pain	8460	8590	The incidence of pain was significantly less (P < 0.012) in patients receiving drugs for pre-treatment than those receiving saline
methylprednisolone group	saline group	pain	1298	1439	The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P < 0.012).
lignocaine group	saline group	pain	8460	8590	The incidence of pain was significantly less (P < 0.012) in patients receiving drugs for pre-treatment than those receiving saline
