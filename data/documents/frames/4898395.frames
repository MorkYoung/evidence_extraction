fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine (FMM)	ketamine (KET)	respiratory rate	1008	1271	Heart rate (beats/min) (Ket = 119 ± 18; FMM = 89 ± 17; p = 0.0066), systolic blood pressure (mmHg) (Ket = 109 ± 10; FMM = 97 ± 10; p = 0.0313), and respiratory rate (breaths/min) (Ket = 39 ± 9; FMM = 29 ± 10; p = 0.0416) were significantly lower in the FMM group.
fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine (FMM)	ketamine (KET)	Recovery rate	1510	1879	Onset of a sufficient degree of sedation for safe handling was more rapid with ketamine (KET = 2.9 ± 1.4 min; FMM = 7.9 ± 1.2 min; p = 0.0009), but FMM recovery was faster (KET = 21.4 ± 13.4 min; FMM = 9.1 ± 3.6 min; p = 0.0379) and of better quality (KET = 1.3 ± 0.9; FMM = 7.4 ± 1.9; p = 0.0009) most probably because of the effectiveness of the reversal agents used.
fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine (FMM)	ketamine (KET)	systolic blood pressure	1008	1271	Heart rate (beats/min) (Ket = 119 ± 18; FMM = 89 ± 17; p = 0.0066), systolic blood pressure (mmHg) (Ket = 109 ± 10; FMM = 97 ± 10; p = 0.0313), and respiratory rate (breaths/min) (Ket = 39 ± 9; FMM = 29 ± 10; p = 0.0416) were significantly lower in the FMM group.
fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine (FMM)	ketamine (KET)	Recovery rate	-1	-1	Recovery was significantly faster in the FMM group (9.1 ± 3.6 min) compared to the KET group (21.4 ± 13.4 min) (p = 0.0379)
fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine (FMM)	ketamine (KET)	Heart rate	1008	1271	Heart rate (beats/min) (Ket = 119 ± 18; FMM = 89 ± 17; p = 0.0066), systolic blood pressure (mmHg) (Ket = 109 ± 10; FMM = 97 ± 10; p = 0.0313), and respiratory rate (breaths/min) (Ket = 39 ± 9; FMM = 29 ± 10; p = 0.0416) were significantly lower in the FMM group.
