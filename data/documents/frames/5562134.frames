Humidified heated breathing circuits	Control	Room temperature 	1084	1164	Skin and room temperatures showed no differences between the two groups (p>0.05)
Humidified heated breathing circuits	Control	Skin temperature 	1084	1165	Skin and room temperatures showed no differences between the two groups (p>0.05).
Humidified heated breathing circuits	Control	Skin temperature 	10833	10947	However, skin and room temperature still did not show significant differences (skin; P = 0.5293, room; P = 0.5997)
Humidified heated breathing circuits	Control	Decrease in core temperature 	10523	10673	However, statistical results didn't show any differences, except core temperature. G1 showed lesser decrease in core temperature than G2 (P = 0.0233).
