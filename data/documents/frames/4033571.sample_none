0	7	SPN - 804	placebo	percent seizure reduction	When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters, a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction (placebo: −13.3%; 1200 mg: −34.5%, P = 0.02; 2400 mg: −52.7%, P = 0.006) in the North American study site cluster.

3	122	SPN - 804	placebo	responder rates	The odds ratio comparing the responder rates was 1.67 (95% CI: 0.95, 2.94) for SPN-804 1200 mg vs placebo and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.50) when comparing 2400 mg and placebo.
7	130	SPN - 804	placebo	PGIC score changes	After 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, PGIC score changes were not significantly different for either SPN-804 dosage vs placebo.
8	134	SPN - 804	placebo	specific adverse events	The incidences of specific adverse events were generally similar for the placebo and SPN-804 1200-mg groups.
9	140	SPN - 804	placebo	Serious adverse events	Serious adverse events occurred in seven patients each in the placebo (5.8%) and SPN-804 1200-mg (5.7%) groups and in 10 (8.1%) in the 2400-mg group.
10	150	carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital	valproate	Clearance	Clearance was increased 31% in patients receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate as concomitant therapy, but was not increased further when more than one of these agents was given as co-therapy.
11	202	SPN - 804	OXC - IR	MHD exposure	Despite ∼19% reduction in MHD exposure with SPN-804 vs OXC-IR at the same mg total daily dose, SPN-804 was associated with ∼50% reductions in the frequency of treatment-limiting adverse events.
12	202	SPN - 804	OXC - IR	treatment - limiting adverse events .	Despite ∼19% reduction in MHD exposure with SPN-804 vs OXC-IR at the same mg total daily dose, SPN-804 was associated with ∼50% reductions in the frequency of treatment-limiting adverse events.
