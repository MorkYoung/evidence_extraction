consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water)	baseline	theta- gamma coupling following PAS	971	1146	Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS.
consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water)	placebo	peak Paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)	-1	-1	Alcohol significantly impaired mean (t = −3.051, df = 13, p = 0.009) and maximum DLPFC PAS-induced neuroplasticity globally (t = −3.260, df = 13, p = 0.006).
consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water)	placebo	mean and maximum potentiation	1147	1361	Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t = −2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally.
consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water)	baseline	theta- gamma coupling following PAS	1362	1434	Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS.
