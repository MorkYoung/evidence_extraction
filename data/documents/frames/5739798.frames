Radical surgery + surgical wound surface injection 	Radical surgery alone 	Overall survival 	1251	1468	The 3 years PFS and OS for SP vs. S were 71.9% vs. 46.9%, and 88.4% vs. 67.0%, respectively. Differences in PFS and OS between two treatment groups were significant with the p values of 0.0165 and 0.0191, respectively
Radical surgery + surgical wound surface injection 	Radical surgery alone 	Metastasis	872	1081	Recurrence or metastasis (Rec/Met) after surgery were 24/82 (29.27%) in SP group and 37/81 (45.68%) in S group. The difference in the Rec/Met rate was statistically significant (p = 0.0304) by chi-square test.
Radical surgery + surgical wound surface injection 	Radical surgery alone 	Progression free survival 	1082	1490	The hazard ratios after adjusting of age and disease stage (S vs. SP) of PFS and OS are 1.772 (95% CI, 1.102 to 2.848) and 2.047 (95% CI, 1.109 to 3.377), respectively. The 3 years PFS and OS for SP vs. S were 71.9% vs. 46.9%, and 88.4% vs. 67.0%, respectively. Differences in PFS and OS between two treatment groups were significant with the p values of 0.0165 and 0.0191, respectively, using Log-Rank test.
