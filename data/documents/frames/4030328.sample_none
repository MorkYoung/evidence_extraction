1	7	placebo	risperidone	amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS	An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P⩽0.04).
2	7	placebo	risperidone	velocities	An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P⩽0.04).
4	99	Risperidone	placebo	peak velocity	Risperidone slowed peak velocity compared with placebo.
5	103	ketamine	placebo	SPEM velocity gain and saccadic frequency	In addition, the ketamine-treated groups showed worse performance on both SPEM velocity gain and saccadic frequency compared with placebo.
6	118	placebo	risperidone	the target	Participants in the risperidone-treated groups undershot the target more strongly compared to participants in the placebo groups.
7	119	Risperidone	ketamine	saccadic peak velocity	Risperidone also lead to a general slowing in saccadic peak velocity, a well-established biomarker of sedation,11 consistent with a recent independent study of our group.33  None of the interactions between ketamine and risperidone were found to be significant.
