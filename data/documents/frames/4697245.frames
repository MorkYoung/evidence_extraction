Alfentanil	Placebo	Heart rate at 1 minute after induction of anesthesia and intubation	1201	1478	Changes in diastolic blood pressure were significantly less in alfentanil group, 1 min after induction of anaesthesia and 1 min after endotracheal intubation. Mean heart rate at 1 min after induction and at 1 and 5 min after intubation also reduced significantly in this group.
Alfentanil	Placebo	Changes in diastolic blood pressure 1 minute after endotracheal extubation	1201	1359	Changes in diastolic blood pressure were significantly less in alfentanil group, 1 min after induction of anaesthesia and 1 min after endotracheal intubation.
Alfentanil	Placebo	Baseline characteristics	10530	10679	There were no significant statistical differences among the two groups regarding age, weight, BIS and maternal pre-operative haemodynamic parameters.
Alfentanil	Placebo	Changes in diastolic blood pressure 1 minute after induction of anaesthesia	1201	1359	Changes in diastolic blood pressure were significantly less in alfentanil group, 1 min after induction of anaesthesia and 1 min after endotracheal intubation.
Alfentanil	Placebo	Baseline characteristics	8166	8463	Mean of age (years) of patients was 28.4 ± 5.77 in alfentanil group and 27.12 ± 5.79 in placebo group. Average weight (kg) of patients was 75.8 ± 10.4 in alfentanil group and 80.4 ± 7.5 in placebo group. The two groups were comparable with respect to pre-operative haemodynamic parameters and BIS®
Alfentanil	Placebo	Neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min	9326	9457	Mean of neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min and neonatal SpO2 were not significantly differerent between the two groups [Table 2].
Alfentanil	Placebo	Heart rate at 1 minute after induction of anesthesia and intubation	8971	9217	There were significant statistical differences between the two groups in regard to mean heart rate 1 min after induction of anaesthesia (P = 0.01), 1 min after endotracheal intubation (P = 0.000) and 5 min after endotracheal intubation (P = 0.04)
Alfentanil	Placebo	Neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min	9326	9448	Mean of neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min and neonatal SpO2 were not significantly differerent between the two groups [
Alfentanil	Placebo	Baseline characteristics	8166	8474	Mean of age (years) of patients was 28.4 ± 5.77 in alfentanil group and 27.12 ± 5.79 in placebo group. Average weight (kg) of patients was 75.8 ± 10.4 in alfentanil group and 80.4 ± 7.5 in placebo group. The two groups were comparable with respect to pre-operative haemodynamic parameters and BIS® [Table 1].
