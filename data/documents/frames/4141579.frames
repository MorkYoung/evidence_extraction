carb counting	control	body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS), total daily insulin doses and serum meanlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels	8750	8980	Although BMI, BMI SDS, total daily insulin doses and serum mean LDL levels showed an annual increase in the follow-up of both the control and carb counting groups (p<0.05), these changes did not differ between the groups (p>0.05).
carb counting	control	Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels	1513	1677	The mean values of high-density lipoprotein were also significantly higher in the first and 2nd years in the carb counting group (p=0.02 and p=0.043, respectively).
carb counting	control	body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS), total daily insulin doses and serum meanlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels	1217	1512	While there were no differences in BMI SDS, daily insulin requirement, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride values between the two groups (p>0.05) during the follow-up, annual mean HbA1c levels of the 2nd year were significantly lower in the carb counting group (p=0.010).
carb counting	control	Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels	8981	9164	Mean HDL levels were significantly high at the end of the first and 2nd years in the carb counting group compared to the controls (p=0.02 for year 1 and p=0.043 for year 2) (Table 2).
