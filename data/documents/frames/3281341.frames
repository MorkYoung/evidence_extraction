class III anginal symptoms	class II anginal symptoms	plasma level of β-endorphin after 2-week omeprazole administration	13654	13983	Subjects with symptoms in class III, according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification (n = 12/48), had a significantly greater plasma level of β-endorphin after 2-week omeprazole administration than subjects (n = 36/48) with class II anginal symptom severity (1246.3±778.0 vs. 643.6 ±525.5 pg/ml, p = 0.004).
double omeprazole dose	placebo	β-endorphin plasma concentration in patients with CAD	1514	1646	Fourteen-day therapy with a double omeprazole dose significantly increases the β-endorphin plasma concentration in patients with CAD
class III anginal symptoms	class II anginal symptoms	plasma level of β-endorphin after 2-week omeprazole administration	975	1490	The level of plasma β-endorphin after the administration of omeprazole was significantly greater than at the start of the study and following the placebo. Responders to omeprazole had an average lower β-endorphin plasma concentration than subjects who failed to respond to this therapy. Subjects with symptoms in class III (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification) after omeprazole administration had a greater β-endorphin plasma level than subjects in class II for anginal symptom severity.
Responders� were defined as subjects who reported decrease in chest pain frequency after omeprazole administration by more than 50%	"non-responders� were defined as individuals with less or lack of improvement.	average β-endorphin plasma concentration during the whole study period	13052	13391	patients who reported a greater than 50% reduction in the number of chest pain episodes (responders) following treatment with omeprazole (n = 17/48, 35%) had a significantly lower average β-endorphin plasma concentration during the whole study period than the remaining subjects (ANOVA: main effect of clinical outcome; F = 4.9, p = 0.037)

double omeprazole dose	placebo	relationships between the β-endorphin plasma level and the course of the treadmill stress test	14260	14483	We did not find any statistically significant relationships between the β-endorphin plasma level and the course of the treadmill stress test, either at the start of the study or after therapy with omeprazole or the placebo.
