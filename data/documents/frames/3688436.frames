donepezil in addition to lithium	placebo in addition to lithium	Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) on the first day	1713	1836	The total YMRS difference on the first day approached the conventional significance level (1.97 units, t = 1.84, P = 0.07).
donepezil in addition to lithium	placebo in addition to lithium	YMRS and the BPRS scale over the course of 4 weeks	14727	15081	Over the course of the 4 weeks, we failed to find that donepezil produced any significant difference in the YMRS as compared to placebo (see Table 3). Both the donepezil and placebo group produced a significant improvement in total scores on the YMRS from baseline to endpoint (donepezil group: t = 4.54, P < 0.0001; placebo group: t = 9.06, P < 0.0001).
donepezil in addition to lithium	placebo in addition to lithium	YMRS and the BPRS scale over the course of 4 weeks	1837	2077	Over the course of 4 weeks, we failed to find that donepezil produced any significant difference in the YMRS (6.71 units difference, t = −1.44, P = 0.16) or the BPRS scale (1.29 units difference, t = −0.33, P = 0.75) as compared to placebo.
donepezil in addition to lithium	placebo in addition to lithium	speech item and the sexual interest item	15982	16225	In the donepezil group, the speech items decreased by 0.57 units more than in the placebo group (t = 2.09, P = 0.04). The sexual interest items in the donepezil group decreased by 0.29 units more than in the placebo group (t = 2.11, P = 0.04).
