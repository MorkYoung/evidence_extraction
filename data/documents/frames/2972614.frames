Laser therapy (Group I)	Placebo laser therapy (Group II)	Adverse effects	10379	10464	. All patients were able to complete the therapy program without any adverse effects.
Laser therapy (Group I)	Placebo laser therapy (Group II)	Severity of pain	1347	1731	In group I, statistically significant improvements in pain severity, range of motion except internal and external rotation and SPADI scores were observed compared to baseline scores after the therapy (p<0.05). In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05).
Laser therapy (Group I)	Placebo laser therapy (Group II)	Motion range	1756	1909	The Low level laser therapy seems to have no superiority over placebo laser therapy in reducing pain severity, range of motion and functional disability.

In Group II, all parameters except range of motion of external rotation were improved (p<0.05). However, no significant differences were recorded between the groups (p>0.05).
