group A (Rapid urease test (RUT) plus noninvasive tests)	baseline	The detection rates of H. pylori infection with each single biopsy taken from site 1, site 2 , and site 3	11171	11362	The detection rates of H. pylori infection by RUT with each single biopsy taken from site 1 (83.8%), site 2 (90.1%), and site 3 (85.6%) were not significantly different (p = 0.284) (Table 4).
 group A (Rapid urease test (RUT) plus noninvasive tests)	baseline	The positive rate of H. pylori infection with each single biopsy taken from site 2 , and site 3	987	1130	The positive rate of RUT was similar at each biopsy site but significantly increased if RUT results from 2 or 3 sites were combined (p < 0.05).

 group A (Rapid urease test (RUT) plus noninvasive tests)	baseline	The positive rate of H. pylori infection with each single biopsy taken from site 2 , and site 3	11171	11709	The detection rates of H. pylori infection by RUT with each single biopsy taken from site 1 (83.8%), site 2 (90.1%), and site 3 (85.6%) were not significantly different (p = 0.284) (Table 4). The detection rates by combined results from 2 biopsy sites: site 1 and site 2 (97.3%), site 1 and site 3 (94.6%), and site 2 and site 3 (95.5%) were also not different from each other but significantly increased when compared with each single biopsy site (Figure 2). The detection rate combined result from 3 biopsy sites was the highest, 98.2%.
group A (Rapid urease test (RUT) plus noninvasive tests)	group B (only noninvasive tests)	H. pylori-positive rate	873	986	H. pylori-positive rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (98.2% versus 86.7%, p = 0.004).
