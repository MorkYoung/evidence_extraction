Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Glucagon concentrations during infusion	1966	2152	There was a transient, non-sustained, reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 minutes GLP-1 (90 ± 12 pmol/ml) vs. placebo (104 ± 10 pmol/ml); P < 0.01).
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Absolute insulin concentrations	1773	1965	The insulin/glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion (GLP-1 (9.1 ± 2.7) vs. placebo (5.8 ± 1.8); P = 0.02) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Absolute insulin concentrations	1906	1965	there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations.
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Glucagon concentrations during infusion	13669	13819	There was a decrease in plasma glucagon from baseline during GLP-1 infusion (t = 30 min GLP-1 90 ± 12 pmol/ml vs. placebo 104 ± 10 pmol/ml; P < 0.01),
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Glycaemic response	1468	1772	In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01).
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Peak blood glucose	1468	1772	In all patients, exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01).
Exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 infusion	Control	Peak blood glucose	1485	1772	exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation (AUC30–270 min GLP-1 (2077 ± 144 mmol/l min) vs placebo (2568 ± 208 mmol/l min); P = 0.02) and the peak blood glucose (GLP-1 (10.1 ± 0.7 mmol/l) vs placebo (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l); P < 0.01).
