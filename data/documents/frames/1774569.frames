buprenorphine	oral dihydrocodeine	clean urine sample	14847	15127	At completion of detoxification, by intention to treat analysis we found a higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a urine sample negative for opiates (abstinent) compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33–3.21, p = 0.028).
buprenorphine	oral dihydrocodeine	Risk of non-completion of detoxification	1190	1316	Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065).
buprenorphine	oral dihydrocodeine	Risk of non-completion of detoxification	14643	14846	There was an increased chance of completing the prescribing regime if allocated buprenorphine though this finding was of borderline statistical significance (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065).
