very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	history of myocardial infarction	11837	11920	history of myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in the intervention group
higher level of education (>12 years)	<12 years of education	improvment in ANELT by day 21	12556	12725	Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more in ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education [3.4 (1.0–4.8) vs. 1.0 (1.0–2.7); p < 0.01]
very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	Amsterdam-Nijmegen everyday language test (ANELT)	12489	12543	no statistical difference between the two study groups
very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	communication ability	1766	1932	Very early intensive SLT with the Language Enrichment Therapy program over 21 days had no effect on the degree of aphasia in unselected acute aphasic stroke patients.
very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	aphasia types	13666	13731	There were no differences in aphasia types between the two groups
very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	history of myocardial infarction	11732	11920	There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups, except for a history of myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in the intervention group
very early speech and language therapy (SLT)	control	communication ability	12199	12543	The primary outcome in the whole group as measured by ANELT by day 21 was 1.3 among the SLT-treated patients and 1.2 among the controls (table 2). The Diff Coeff was 8.5 in the SLT group and 9 in the control group. Also, per protocol analyses of ANELT by day 21 and for Diff Coeff revealed no statistical difference between the two study groups
higher level of education (>12 years)	<12 years of education	improvment in ANELT by day 21	1346	1500	Patients with a higher level of education (>12 years) improved more on ANELT by day 21 than those with <12 years of education (3.4 vs. 1.0, respectively).
