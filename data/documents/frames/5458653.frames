vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) for 12weeks	baseline	mean plasma glucose level, HbA1c	846	1003	Vildagliptin did not significantly alter the mean plasma glucose level (175.5 ± 54.4 mg/dL vs. 179.1 ± 73.4 mg/dL) or HbA1c (8.01% vs. 8.02%) after 12 weeks.
switching from vildagliptin to high-dose sitagliptin (100 mg daily)	baseline	mean plasma glucose level, HbA1c	1176	1398	At 12 weeks after switching from vildagliptin to high-dose sitagliptin (100 mg daily), HbA1c was increased to 8.3%, but it was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to the baseline level of 8.0% after switching from alogliptin.
alogliptin (25 mg once daily)	baseline	mean plasma glucose level, HbA1c	1004	1175	With alogliptin, mean plasma glucose increased from 175.4 ± 50.9 mg/dL to 195.3 ± 55.0 mg/dL after 12 weeks and HbA1c increased significantly from 8.0% to 8.3% (P < 0.05).
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) for 12weeks	alogliptin (25 mg once daily)	HbA1c	1399	1512	The reduction of HbA1c was significantly greater in the vildagliptin group than the alogliptin group (P = 0.008),
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) for 12weeks	alogliptin (25 mg once daily)	HbA1c	846	1175	Vildagliptin did not significantly alter the mean plasma glucose level (175.5 ± 54.4 mg/dL vs. 179.1 ± 73.4 mg/dL) or HbA1c (8.01% vs. 8.02%) after 12 weeks. With alogliptin, mean plasma glucose increased from 175.4 ± 50.9 mg/dL to 195.3 ± 55.0 mg/dL after 12 weeks and HbA1c increased significantly from 8.0% to 8.3% (P < 0.05).
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) for 12weeks	alogliptin (25 mg once daily)	HbA1c	10968	11117	Comparison between the vildagliptin and alogliptin groups showed that the reduction of HbA1c was significantly greater with vildagliptin (P = 0.008).
