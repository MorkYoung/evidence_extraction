propofol (1.5 mg/kg) in Group Ι, remifentanil (0.05 μg/kg), fentanyl (1 μg/kg) + propofol (1.5 mg/kg) combination in Group III	propofol (1.5 mg/kg) combination in Group II 	pain level	8111	8378	Also there was statistically significant difference between the groups during the follow-up (monitorization) period in terms of pain levels (p < 0.05). The patients in Group I suffered from the pain most, whereas the patients in Group II had the least pain (Table 3).
