Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Breathing trial failure	13726	13975	We found that 9 of 19 (47%) patients in the PSV group failed the breathing trial compared to only 6 of 17 (35%) patients in the ATC group. This observed difference of 12% between both groups however did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.69).
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Extubation failure	11876	11929	Failed extubation was equal in both groups (P = 0.9).
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Positive predictive value for extubation failure	715	1006	In the ATC group (n = 17), 11 (65%) patients passed the SBT with subsequent extubation failure (9%). While in PSV group (n = 19), 10 (53%) patients passed the SBT with subsequent extubation failure (10%). This represented a positive predictive value for ATC of 91% and PSV of 90% (P = 0.52).
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Extubation failure	11876	11928	Failed extubation was equal in both groups (P = 0.9)
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Causes of reintubation	12050	12151	There were no significant difference in the causes of reintubation between the two groups (P = 0.46).
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Baseline characteristics	11296	11546	Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Respiratory and hemodynamic characteristics during the spontaneous breathing trial are shown in Table 2. There were no significant differences between the ATC and PSV groups in any of the compared items.
Automatic tube compensation	Pressure support ventilation	Baseline characteristics	11448	11546	There were no significant differences between the ATC and PSV groups in any of the compared items.
