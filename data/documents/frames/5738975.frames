G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion	standard care	change in MELD scores in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis	23115	23379	We found no evidence of a difference in change in MELD scores between days 0 and 90 in either of the treatment groups compared with the standard care group (p=0·72 for G-CSF vs standard care and p=0·90 for the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group vs standard care).
G-CSF	standard care	change in MELD scores in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis	23124	23379	no evidence of a difference in change in MELD scores between days 0 and 90 in either of the treatment groups compared with the standard care group (p=0·72 for G-CSF vs standard care and p=0·90 for the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group vs standard care).
G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion	standard care	trend in MELD over time in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis	22915	23379	Median change in MELD from day 0 to 90 was −0·5 (IQR −1·5 to 1·1) in the standard care group, −0·5 (−1·7 to 0·5) in the G-CSF group, and −0·5 (−1·3 to 1·0) in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group. We found no evidence of a difference in change in MELD scores between days 0 and 90 in either of the treatment groups compared with the standard care group (p=0·72 for G-CSF vs standard care and p=0·90 for the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group vs standard care).

G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion	standard care	trend in MELD over time in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis	-1	-1	no evidence of a trend in MELD over time (p=0·33 for all groups), nor of a difference between the treatment and control groups (p=0·55 for the G-CSF group vs the standard care group and p=0·75 for the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group vs the standard care group).
G-CSF	standard care	change in MELD scores in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis	-1	-1	The median MELD score was 13·1 (IQR 12·4–13·8) in the standard treatment group, 12·7 (12·0–13·1) in the G-CSF group, and 13·2 (12·1–13·9) in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group
