30-Hz whole-body vibration training	50-Hz whole-body vibration training	Maximal voluntary isometric contraction	907	1016	In the 30-Hz group, there was a significant increase in the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (p=0.039)
30-Hz whole-body vibration training	50-Hz whole-body vibration training	Concentric peak torque of knee extensors	907	1150	In the 30-Hz group, there was a significant increase in the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (p=0.039) and the concentric peak torque (p=0.018) of knee extensors and these changes were significant (p<0.05) compared with the 50-Hz group.
30-Hz whole-body vibration training	50-Hz whole-body vibration training	Eccentric peak torque of knee extensors	1151	1339	In addition, the eccentric peak torque of knee extensors was increased significantly in both groups (p<0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.873).
30-Hz whole-body vibration training	50-Hz whole-body vibration training	Attendance rates	17508	17599	No significant difference existed between the two groups in the attendance rates (p=0.286).
30-Hz whole-body vibration training	50-Hz whole-body vibration training	Concentric peak torque of knee extensors	19351	19688	a statistically significant increase has occurred in the concentric peak torque of knee extensors in the 30-Hz (+13.6%; p<0.001) group, while not in the 50-Hz (+2.1%; p=0.605) group. When the groups were compared, there was a significant (p=0.018) difference between the two groups in terms of improvements in the concentric peak torque.
