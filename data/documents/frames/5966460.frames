Carbopol gel	Hydroxyethylcellulose gel	Protein expression	-1	-1	In both placebo gel formulations, significant intra-macaque differences in protein expression were observed between the averaged baseline and the 2 hours post-gel timepoint, with carbopol inducing more changes (76/382 proteins (19.9%), p < 0.017) than HEC (36/382 (9.4%), p < 0.0073) (two-tailed, paired t test, Local FDR <5%).
Griffithsin gel	Control	Protein levels	856	1109	Compared to placebo, GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point (FDR < 5%), but increased abundances of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after 24 hours were observed in HEC-GRFT gel (p < 2E-09)
Griffithsin gel	Control	Protein levels	856	983	Compared to placebo, GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point (FDR < 5%),
