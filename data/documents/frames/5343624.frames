Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Density changes	23734	23890	Accordingly, the radiologically investigated volumetric and bone density changes in the present study also did not differ significantly between both groups.
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Formation of new bone	23462	23583	no statistically significant difference in new bone formation could be observed (NB: 21.85% ± 5.96%; BO: 25.73% ± 7.94%).
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Volume reduction	1585	1645	In both materials, the volume reduction was not significant.
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Volume reduction	25333	25596	This assumption is in accordance with the results presented, as the volume reduction and density increase did not show any difference between both groups, although in histological analysis, significantly more multinucleated giant cells were found in the NB group.
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Volume reduction	1358	1645	Radiographic analysis revealed a volume reduction of the initial augmented bone substitute material (i.e. 100%) to 77.36 (±11.68) % in the BO-group, respectively, 75.82 (±22.28) % in the NB-group six months after augmentation. In both materials, the volume reduction was not significant.
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Density changes	25401	25487	volume reduction and density increase did not show any difference between both groups,
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO)	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Vascularization and ratio of connective tissue	22756	23146	In accordance with the presence of multinucleated giant cells, which are transported in the augmentation bed by a vessel-rich connective tissue, the vascularization and the ratio of connective tissue were significantly higher in the NB group (percentage vascularization: NB: 2.66% ± 0.78%; BO: 0.86% ± 0.07%; P < 0.001; connective tissue: NB: 53.87% ± 5.12%; BO: 34.14% ± 4.45%; P < 0.001).
Xenogeneic bone substitute material (Bio-Oss®, BO) 	Synthetic bone substitute material (NanoBone®, NB) 	Ratio of remaining material	23147	23373	Further, the analysis of the tissue distribution in the implantation bed showed a significantly higher ratio of remaining bone substitute material in BO than that in NB group (NB: 24.28% ± 3.26%; BO: 40.13% ± 3.53%; P < 0.01).
