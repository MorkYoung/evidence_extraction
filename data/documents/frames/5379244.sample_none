0	114	usual pump therapy	closed - loop insulin delivery	mean glucose concentration	Day-and-night closed-loop insulin delivery reduced mean glucose concentration by 0·4 mmol/L (0·1–0·7, p=0·0226) compared with usual pump therapy (table 2, figure 3).
1	117	usual pump therapy	closed - loop insulin delivery	proportion of time with glucose concentration	Compared with usual pump therapy, closed-loop insulin delivery reduced the proportion of time with glucose concentration above the target range (ie, >10 mmol/L) by 6·9 percentage points (3·5–10·2, p=0·0003), above 13·9 mmol/L by 3·0 percentage points (1·6–4·4, p=0·0002) and above 16·7 mmol/L by 1·2 percentage points (0·6–1·9, p=0·0009; table 2).
2	155	usual pump therapy	closed - loop insulin delivery	time spent with glucose concentration	The proportion of time spent with glucose concentration below the target range (ie, 3·9 mmol/L) during usual pump therapy (5·3%, IQR 3·5–10·0) was notably higher in our study than that in Thabit and colleagues' study (3·0%, 1·8–6·1)13 but still lower than that in a study in adults with a mean baseline HbA1c of 6·7% (mean proportion of time spent with sensor glucose below target range 14% [SD 11]).19 Another study15 assessed the use of closed-loop insulin delivery during night time in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, using a control algorithm with a lower glucose setpoint to accommodate lower glucose targets (3·5–7·8 mmol/L) for this group of patients.
