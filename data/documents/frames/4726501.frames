receive aspirin (81 mg or 100 mg daily,	no aspirin	the incidence of positive urine dipstick albumin	15209	15479	The multivariable analyses showed that low-dose aspirin was not associated with the incidence of positive urine dipstick albumin in the intension-to-treat analysis (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.32) and the on-treatment analysis (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.27) (Table 2).
receive aspirin (81 mg or 100 mg daily,	no aspirin	The annual change in eGFR	16960	17165	The annual change in eGFR was −0.8 ± 2.9 ml/min/1.73m2/year in the aspirin group, and −0.9 ± 2.5 ml/min/1.73m2/year in the no aspirin group. There was no significant difference in the both group (P = 0.2).
