CPAP	routine	birth characteristics, complications during the prenatal period, the need for mechanical ventilation during the first 5 days of life, use of surfactant	921	1288	The routine (n=99) and CPAP (n=98) infants studied presented no statistically significant differences regarding birth characteristics, complications during the prenatal period, the need for mechanical ventilation during the first 5 days of life (19.2 vs 23.4%, P=0.50), use of surfactant (18.2 vs 17.3% P=0.92), or respiratory morbidity and mortality until discharge.
CPAP	routine	The occurrence of apnea	8923	9028	The occurrence of apnea was high in both groups (33.6% in the CPAP group and 42.4% in the routine group).
CPAP	baseline	number of doses of surfactant	1289	1374	The CPAP group required a greater number of doses of surfactant (1.5 vs 1.0, P=0.02).
