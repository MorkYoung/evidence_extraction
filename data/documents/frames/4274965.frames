post phase	pre phase	stress levels	18154	18414	Furthermore, there was a significant main effect of measurement time, F(2,116) = 4.78, p = 0.015, η2 = 0.08, with lower stress levels in the post phase (M = 16.68, SD = 5.97) than in the pre phase (M = 18.39, SD = 6.46) and on follow-up (M = 18.71, SD = 5.69).
younger adults	older adults	stress levels	19106	19340	Moreover for the overall ANOVA, there was no significant main effect of age, F(1,58) = 0.86, p = 0.358, η2 = 0.01, indicating that stress levels of younger (M = 18.42, SD = 4.53) and older adults (M = 17.36, SD = 5.35) did not differ.
younger adults	older adults	stress levels	733	840	Subjective and physiological stress levels showed no age difference and no detrimental association with PM.
post phase	pre phase	stress levels	18165	18373	, there was a significant main effect of measurement time, F(2,116) = 4.78, p = 0.015, η2 = 0.08, with lower stress levels in the post phase (M = 16.68, SD = 5.97) than in the pre phase (M = 18.39, SD = 6.46)
relaxation group	control	stress levels	17903	18153	For subjective stress levels, there was a significant main effect of relaxation condition, F(1,58) = 5.84, p = 0.019, η2 = 0.09, with lower stress levels in the relaxation group (M = 16.47, SD = 4.29) than in the control group (M = 19.29, SD = 5.14).
