Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Expression of GGH, PECAM1, or TOP2A 	10290	10541	There were no statistically significant interactions between GGH, PECAM1, or TOP2A expression and S-1 treatment at the respective recurrence sites, and no statistically significant factors were correlated with local recurrence (Supplementary Table 2).
Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Peritoneal recurrence related to PECAM1 expression	19337	19481	PECAM1 showed a significant correlation to peritoneal recurrence in both surgery alone (FDR P = 0.005) and S-1 treated patients (FDR P = 0.031).
Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Hematogenous recurrence related to TOP2A expression	19659	19789	TOP2A expression correlated significantly with hematogenous recurrence in the surgery alone group but not in S-1 treated patients.
Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Expression of GGH, PECAM1, or TOP2A 	19915	20072	No statistically significant interaction for site-specific recurrence was observed between 56 gene expressions and the treatment type (S-1 vs. Surgery alone)
Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Metastasis and relapse rates	8381	8479	Rates of metastasis and relapse were lower in the S-1 than in the surgery-only group for all sites
Adjuvant S-1 therapy after sugery	Surgery alone	Expression of GGH, PECAM1, or TOP2A 	10290	10436	There were no statistically significant interactions between GGH, PECAM1, or TOP2A expression and S-1 treatment at the respective recurrence sites
