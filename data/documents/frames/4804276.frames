 nutraceutical combination (NC)	no active treatment (noNC)	high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and endothelial microparticle (EMPs) levels	15376	15628	At the end of the study intervention, treatment differences of hsCRP and EMPs between NC and noNC were 41% and 16%, respectively (Table 2); GLM for repeated measures was significant for both treatment differences (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001, respectively).
nutraceutical combination (NC)	no active treatment (noNC)	The total and LDL cholesterol	14818	15003	The total and LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased significantly between baseline and 3-month in the NC-treated group compared with the noNC-treated group (p < 0.001 for both GLMs).
nutraceutical combination (NC)	no active treatment (noNC)	The total and LDL cholesterol	916	1066	Patients taking the NC had a significant reduction of total (−12%) and LDL cholesterol (−23%) compared to those who received noNC (p < 0.001 for both)
 nutraceutical combination (NC)	no active treatment (noNC)	high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and endothelial microparticle (EMPs) levels	1068	1156	Also, hsCRP and EMPs were significantly reduced by the NC (−41% and −16%, respectively).
