migalastat	enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)	effects on renal function	1354	1411	Migalastat and ERT had similar effects on renal function.
migalastat	enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)	phenotype categories	17715	17806	There were no significant differences in the phenotype categories between treatment groups.
migalastat	enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)	left ventricular mass index (LVMi)	22369	22536	In patients switched from ERT to migalastat, left ventricular mass index (LVMi) decreased significantly from baseline over 18 months (−6.6 g/m2; 95% CI −11.0 to −2.2);
migalastat	enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)	left ventricular mass index (LVMi)	22369	22687	In patients switched from ERT to migalastat, left ventricular mass index (LVMi) decreased significantly from baseline over 18 months (−6.6 g/m2; 95% CI −11.0 to −2.2); a smaller, non-significant change was observed in patients who remained on ERT (−2.0 g/m2 (−11.0, 7.0)) (table 5; see online supplementary figure S1).
