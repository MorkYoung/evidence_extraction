inhalative epinephrine	i.m. epinephrine	blood pressure	-1	-1	In response to the administration of the study medication, heart rate increased, while blood pressure values were essentially unchanged (Table 1, see also supplementary material).
inhalative epinephrine	placebo	mean values of AUC0-t(last)	900	1205	Mean exposure to epinephrine decreased from the 8 mg dose to the 4 mg inhalative dose, and further with the 0.3 mg intramuscular dose, with active treatments showing significantly higher concentrations than placebo (geometric mean area under the curve AUC0-t(last) values: 282, 236, 204 and 81.6 hr*ng/L).
inhalative epinephrine	i.m. epinephrine	blood pressure	-1	-1	blood pressure did not show consistent differences between treatments
inhalative epinephrine	placebo	mean values of AUC0-t(last)	-1	-1	The mean values of Cmax and AUC0-t(last) were considerably higher following inhalative epinephrine administrations compared to placebo.
inhalative epinephrine	placebo	mean values of Cmax	-1	-1	The mean values of Cmax and AUC0-t(last) were considerably higher following inhalative epinephrine administrations compared to placebo.
inhalative epinephrine	i.m. epinephrine	Cmax	14362	14638	Mean exposure to epinephrine as derived from Cmax, partial AUCs and AUC0-t(last) was highest for the 8 mg inhalative dose and decreased from the 4 mg inhalative dose to the 0.3 mg i.m. dose, with all active treatments being significantly higher than placebo (Table 1, Fig. 1).
