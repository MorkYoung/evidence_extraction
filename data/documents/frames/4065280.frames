Pantothenic acid	Control	Total lesion count	1354	1484	There was a significant mean reduction in total lesion count in the pantothenic acid group versus placebo at week 12 (P = 0.0197).
Pantothenic acid	Control	Dermatology Life Quality Index scores	1485	1652	Mean reduction in inflammatory lesions was also significantly reduced and DLQI scores were significantly lower at week 12 in the pantothenic acid group versus placebo.
Pantothenic acid	Control	Inflammatory lesions	1485	1652	Mean reduction in inflammatory lesions was also significantly reduced and DLQI scores were significantly lower at week 12 in the pantothenic acid group versus placebo.
Pantothenic acid	Control	Investigators Global Assessment-measured overall efficacy	-1	-1	Overall efficacy, as measured by the IGA, was significantly improved for the study agent group versus placebo at week 12 (P = 0.045)
Pantothenic acid	Control	Hepatic function	11715	11881	There were no differences in complete blood count or hepatic function as measured at week 12 from baseline in any subjects in either the study agent or placebo groups
Pantothenic acid	Control	Dermatology Life Quality Index scores	1559	1652	DLQI scores were significantly lower at week 12 in the pantothenic acid group versus placebo.
Pantothenic acid	Control	Non-inflammatory lesions	-1	-1	Analysis of the number of non-inflammatory blemishes demonstrated a significant mean reduction in lesion count from baseline to week 12 in the study agent versus the placebo group (P = 0.0162)
