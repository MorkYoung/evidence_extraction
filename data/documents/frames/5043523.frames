knowledge of MTHFR 677C → T genotype	control or not at risk	folate intakes	1300	1509	There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6. Similarly, there were no changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate.
knowledge of MTHFR 677C → T genotype	control or not at risk	folate intakes	19025	19371	lthough both intervention groups (risk and non-risk) increased their folate intakes in comparison with the control, there were no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.131). There were no significant differences between the risk, non-risk or control with respect to changes in reported intakes of food groups high in folate (Table 2).
