Radial shockwave therapy	Physiotherapy sessions + kinesiotherapy	Hours of pain per day	11018	11563	We showed in a previous study that shockwave treatment was no more effective than conventional physiotherapy treatment three months after the end of treatment (20), but we did not know what the effects would be after one year. Both groups showed improvements in pain symptoms between three months and one year, including fewer episodes of pain per week (Table 1 and fewer hours of pain per day. There were decreases in the intensity of morning pain (Table 2, gait pain (Table 3 and pain while standing upright, all assessed using a VAS for pain.
