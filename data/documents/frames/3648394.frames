10-week yoga program 	Control	pNN50 	1301	1538	All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses.
10-week yoga program 	Control	Flexibility	1539	1656	Flexibility, evaluated via sit & reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.001).
10-week yoga program 	Control	Push-up test	25231	25320	No group × time interaction effect was noted for the push-up test or the side-bridge test
10-week yoga program 	Control	Push-up test	1690	1978	Post hoc analysis comparing participants who completed ≥70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control.
