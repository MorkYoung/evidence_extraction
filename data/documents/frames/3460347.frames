(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	main effects for drug, gum, group, or time block	27563	27640	No significant main effects were observed for drug, gum, group, or time block
(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)	1354	1492	Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD, with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co-administration of nicotine.
(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)	1810	1859	hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD
(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	auditory event-related brain potential – mismatch negativity (MMN) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)	1354	1412	Ketamine significantly slowed MMN, and reduced MMN in H-HD
(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	d′ (weight hits and false alarms into a single measure) in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD)	1810	1859	hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H-HD
(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg)	(NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum	main effects for drug, gum, group, or time block	27563	27758	No significant main effects were observed for drug, gum, group, or time block but a significant group × drug × block (F = 4.05, df = 2, 44, p = 0.031) interaction was demonstrated for amplitudes.
