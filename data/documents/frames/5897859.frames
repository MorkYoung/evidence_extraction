Vonoprazan 10 mg	Vonoprazan 20 mg	Erosive esophagitis recurrence rate after 24 weeks	1394	1732	In a post-hoc analysis, EE recurrence at Week 24 was significantly reduced with vonoprazan at both the 10 mg and the 20 mg dose vs lansoprazole 15 mg (5.1% vs 16.8%, P = 0.0002, and 2.0% vs 16.8%, P < 0.0001, respectively); by contrast, the EE recurrence rate did not differ significantly between the two doses of vonoprazan (P = 0.1090).
Vonoprazan 10 and 20 mg	Lansoprazole 15 mg	Changes in vital signs, ECG, or laboratory test values	32212	32367	No clinically significant changes were observed in clinical laboratory test values, vital signs, or ECG findings in any group during maintenance treatment.
Vonoprazan 10 mg	Vonoprazan 20 mg	Erosive esophagitis recurrence rate after 24 weeks	1138	1302	Rates of EE recurrence during the 24-wk maintenance period were 16.8%, 5.1%, and 2.0% with lansoprazole 15 mg, vonoprazan 10 mg, and vonoprazan 20 mg, respectively.
Vonoprazan 10 and 20 mg	Lansoprazole 15 mg	Safety profiles	1733	1850	The safety profiles of vonoprazan 10 and 20 mg were similar to that of lansoprazole 15 mg in patients with healed EE.
Vonoprazan 10 and 20 mg	Lansoprazole 15 mg	Baseline characteristics	18697	18945	The three maintenance groups were well matched in terms of demographic and other baseline characteristics (Table 1), and had similar baseline EE severities and medical histories. The mean treatment compliance rate was > 97% in each treatment group.
