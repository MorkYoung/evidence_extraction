ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Zinc levels (at 2 weeks)	22459	22684	The mixed model analysis for copper and zinc at 2, 6, and 24 weeks showed that ARV treatment significantly and negatively affected milk copper and zinc concentrations (p = .044 and p = .014) but only at the initial 2 weeks TP
ARV	Lipid based nutrient	CD4 count	17939	18053	Significant differences were only observed for the CD4 counts with higher counts for the groups that received ARV.
ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Zinc levels (at 2 weeks)	21961	22100	ARV by TP by FTP interactions were significant for copper (p = .034), whereas ARV by FTP interactions were significant for zinc (p = .031).
ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Copper levels (at 2 weeks)	22459	22685	The mixed model analysis for copper and zinc at 2, 6, and 24 weeks showed that ARV treatment significantly and negatively affected milk copper and zinc concentrations (p = .044 and p = .014) but only at the initial 2 weeks TP.
ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Copper levels (at 6 weeks)	22459	22685	The mixed model analysis for copper and zinc at 2, 6, and 24 weeks showed that ARV treatment significantly and negatively affected milk copper and zinc concentrations (p = .044 and p = .014) but only at the initial 2 weeks TP.
ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Iron levels (at 2 weeks)	21615	21832	For iron, no interactions by treatment (ARV and LNS) or with treatment and TP and/or FTP were significant indicating that the effects of ARV and LNS at 2, 6, and 24 weeks were not different from each other (Table S2).
ARV	Lipid based nutrients	Copper levels (at 2 weeks)	21961	22100	ARV by TP by FTP interactions were significant for copper (p = .034), whereas ARV by FTP interactions were significant for zinc (p = .031).
