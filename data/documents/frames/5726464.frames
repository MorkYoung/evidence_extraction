Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	Lipid profile	14537	14967	Fasting total and HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly by weeks 24 and 48 for both arms, with no significant differences between the 2 arms (Table 2). In the placebo arm, LDL cholesterol increased at week 24 from baseline but not at week 48. However, triglyceride changes from baseline to week 24 or week 48 were not significant in either arm. None of the changes in lipid parameters appeared to differ by treatment arm.

Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	25(OH)D levels	11769	12204	Increases in 25(OH)D levels were observed in the VitD/Cal arm at 24 and 48 weeks: median concentrations increased 27.5 ng/mL (q1, Q3 = 15.0, 38.0 ng/mL) and 24.2 ng/mL (q1, Q3 = 14.6, 37.8 ng/mL) from baseline to weeks 24 and 48, respectively (P < .001 for both) in the VitD/Cal arm. No significant changes in the placebo arm were detected (–0.8 ng/mL [Q1, Q3 = –5.9, 4.9 ng/mL] and 0.6 ng/mL [Q1, Q3 = –6.1, 4.3 ng/mL], respectively).
Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	Metabolic syndrome	15979	16132	Metabolic syndrome was identified in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, with no significant difference between arms.
Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	Changes in body mass index	15913	15978	Changes in BMI were not significant over 48 weeks for either arm.
Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	Changes in body mass index	15648	15977	Baseline waist circumference and BMI values appear to be balanced between the 2 arms (Table 1). Waist circumference increased in the placebo arm but not in the VitD/Cal arm at both weeks 24 and 48, but differences between the 2 arms were not significant (Table 2). Changes in BMI were not significant over 48 weeks for either arm
Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation	Placebo	Glucose and insulin	15459	15592	Between-arm differences were not significant for glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR changes at either week 24 or week 48 (P > .05 for all).
