PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	sustained virological response (SVR) Rates - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	18038	18200	The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; there was no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.597)
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	relapse rates - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	18202	18307	The relapse rates in the 24- and 48-week groups were 5.3% (4/76) and 3.9% (3/76), respectively (P = 0.70)
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	dose reduction - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	22805	22919	18 (23.7%) and 22 (28.9%) patients in the 24- and 48-week groups (P = 0.46), respectively, required dose reduction
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	anemia rates - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	1510	1583	More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03)
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	subcutaneous injections of erythropoietin - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	20972	21117	15 patients (19.7%) in the 24-week groups and 24 patients (31.6%) in 48-week groups (P = 0.09) received subcutaneous injections of erythropoietin
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	anemia rates - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	20633	20817	Significantly more patients (46.1%) in the 48-week group had mild anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) than patients (28.9%) in the 24-week group (mean difference -1.3%, 95% CI -7.6% to 5.0%).
PEG-IFN α-2a - 24 weeks	PEG-IFN α-2a - 48 weeks	dose reduction - patients with chronic hepatitis C with HCV genotype 6	22584	22920	In the 24- and 48-week groups, 2 (2.6%) and 3 (3.9%) patients, respectively, had platelet counts <50/μL and thus required IFN dose reduction and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor administration (P = 0.31). Overall, 18 (23.7%) and 22 (28.9%) patients in the 24- and 48-week groups (P = 0.46), respectively, required dose reduction.
