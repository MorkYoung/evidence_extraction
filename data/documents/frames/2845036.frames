mofetil (MMF) alone or with daclizumab (DZB)	placebo	The geometric mean C-peptide AUC at 2 years	961	1064	The geometric mean C-peptide AUC at 2 years was unaffected by MMF alone or MMF plus DZB versus placebo.
mofetil (MMF) with daclizumab (DZB)	mofetil (MMF) 	A1C	18038	18626	Figure 1C and D show that these mean ratios and confidence limits within subgroups, defined by baseline characteristics, are not nominally significantly different from 1, with the exception of the effect of MMF alone within the 10 subjects in the highest tertile of baseline A1C (P = 0.042). However, comparison of ratios among the A1C tertiles, and among all other subgroups, failed to reach significance demonstrating that variation among subgroups was within the realm of chance. Similar results applied to subgroups defined from the mean levels of A1C and insulin dose over 24 months.
