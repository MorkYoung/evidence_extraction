RT-qPCR	qIHC of Ki-67 or vIHC of Ki-67	proliferation levels of RNA	20251	20552	However, as illustrated in Fig. 4, statistically significant differences between groups were found for the RT-qPCR but not for IHC methods when patients were stratified according to proliferation and pCR (Mannâ€“Whitney p = 0.003 and p = 0,005 for RT-qPCR and p = 0.099 for qIHC and p = 0.133 for vIHC).
