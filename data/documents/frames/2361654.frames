primary hrHPV screening	cytological screening	colposcopy referrals (sensitivity?)	15366	15705	Compared with the conventional arm, clearly more colposcopy referrals were made in the hrHPV screening arm (RR 1.51, CI 95% 1.03–2.22). As a result of performed colposcopies, a total of 52 histologically confirmed precancerous lesions were detected within the study population: 33 in the hrHPV screening arm and 19 in the conventional arm.
primary hrHPV screening	cytological screening	colposcopy referrals (sensitivity?)	15366	15501	Compared with the conventional arm, clearly more colposcopy referrals were made in the hrHPV screening arm (RR 1.51, CI 95% 1.03–2.22).
primary hrHPV screening	cytological screening	Specificity	1075	1295	Specificity of the primary screening with sole hrHPV test (91.5–92.1%) was much lower than that with the cytology triage (98.7–99.3%), which was not quite as specific as screening with conventional cytology (99.2–99.6%).
