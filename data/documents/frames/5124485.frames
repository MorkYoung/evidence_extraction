temozolomide (TMZ) (75 mg/m2 daily × 21 days, q28 days, max. 12 cycles)	standard radiotherapy (RT) (50.4 Gy/28 fractions)	progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with IDHmt/non-codel tumors	27500	27791	Only patients with IDHmt/non-codel tumors had a longer PFS when treated with RT than with TMZ (median PFS 55 months (95% CI, 48 to 66) versus 36 months (95% CI, 28.4 to 47) translating into a HR of 0.53 (0.35 – 0.82; logrank p= 0.0043) (see appendix of supplemental data, appendix table S6).
temozolomide (TMZ) (75 mg/m2 daily × 21 days, q28 days, max. 12 cycles)	standard radiotherapy (RT) (50.4 Gy/28 fractions)	median progression-free survival (PFS)	24805	25069	The median PFS was 46 months (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 40 to 56) with RT alone and 39 months (CI, 35 to 44) with TMZ alone (Figure 2). The unadjusted HR for progression was 1.16 for patients treated with TMZ versus RT (CI, 0.9 to 1.5; log-rank p=0.22).

IDHmt/non-codel (9.0 months)	IDHmt/codel (5.6 months) and IDHwt (3.4 months)	time from initial surgery/histology to treatment	26665	26845	Interestingly, time from initial surgery/histology to treatment was longer in IDHmt/non-codel (9.0 months) compared to IDHmt/codel (5.6 months) and IDHwt (3.4 months) (p = 0.0057).
