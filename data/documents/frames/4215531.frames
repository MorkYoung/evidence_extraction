facial affect training (FAT) in 20 daily 1-hour sessions 	treatment as usual (TAU)	alpha power	1481	1736	Moreover, alpha power increase during the dynamic facial affect recognition task was larger after affect training than after treatment-as-usual, though similar to that after targeted perceptual–cognitive training, indicating somewhat nonspecific benefits.
facial affect training (FAT) in 20 daily 1-hour sessions 	baseline	MCCB performance : Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Reasoning, or Social Cognition	29744	30179	MCCB performance generally improved after intervention (Time F(1,54) = 28.45, p < .001). A Domain × Time interaction (F(6,324) = 4.05, p = .001, HF = .91) reflected improvement in Processing Speed (F(1,56) = 33.56, p < .01), Attentional Vigilance (F(1,56) = 15.82, p < .01), and Visual Learning (F(1,56) = 11.99, p = .001) but not in Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Reasoning, or Social Cognition (see Table 2 for normative T-scores).
facial affect training (FAT) in 20 daily 1-hour sessions 	baseline	alpha power	1139	1405	Effects on 10–13 Hz (alpha) power during the transition from neutral to emotional expressions were assessed via MEG based on previous findings that alpha power increase is related to facial affect recognition and is smaller in schizophrenia than in healthy subjects.
facial affect training (FAT) in 20 daily 1-hour sessions 	baseline	alpha power	26034	26311	An Emotion × Time analysis of the FAT group produced a main effect of Time, F(1,18) = 5.61, p = .03 (p = .02), reflecting a greater increase in alpha power from prestimulus baseline during the pre-recognition period of the FAR criterion task after training than before training

An Intervention (FAT vs. TAU) × Emotion × Time analysis produced a marginal effect of Time, F(1,36) = 2.80, p = .1 (p > .1), reflecting some general improvement over time in the pooled sample, and an Intervention × Time interaction, F(1,36) = 4.78, p = .04 (p = .05), reflecting improvement in the FAT group (Fig. 4, left) vs. a nonsignificant decline in the TAU group (Fig. 4, right).
