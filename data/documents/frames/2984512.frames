Protemp 3 Garan	Fast set Temphase	Diametral tensile strength after 5 minutes	8398	8612	At 5 minutes, PT3 showed the highest value (23.16 MPa), followed by TMP (22.27 MPa) and LXT (14.46 MPa). PT3 and TMP were significantly higher than LXT (P < .05) (Table II). PT3 and TMP were comparable (P = 0.694).
