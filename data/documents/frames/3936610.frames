Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Rate of complications	10334	10472	We did not observe any complications, such as significant changes in MAP or arrhythmias, in either group in the post-anesthetic care unit.
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Baseline ranges of HR, MAP, and QTc intervals	8640	8839	All patients had normal baseline ranges of HR, MAP, and QTc intervals at rest, and there were no statistically significant differences in baseline HR, MAP, QTc, and Tp-e value between the two groups.
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	QTc interval values	8640	8839	All patients had normal baseline ranges of HR, MAP, and QTc intervals at rest, and there were no statistically significant differences in baseline HR, MAP, QTc, and Tp-e value between the two groups.
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Baseline ranges of HR, MAP, and QTc intervals	8657	8838	normal baseline ranges of HR, MAP, and QTc intervals at rest, and there were no statistically significant differences in baseline HR, MAP, QTc, and Tp-e value between the two groups
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Tp-e interval	9739	9850	No significant changes in the Tp-e interval from baseline were observed in either group at any measurement time
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	QTc interval values	543	925	QTc intervals were significantly prolonged after spinal anesthesia, and the prolonged QTc interval returned to baseline values 10 minutes after either normal saline or dexmedetomidine administration in both groups. The QTc interval values after dexmedetomidine administration were significantly shorter compared to the QTc interval values just before dexmedetomidine administration.
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Change of MAP	9862	9980	There was no significant change of MAP in either group among patients, who did not require administration of ephedrine
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	QTc interval values	758	925	The QTc interval values after dexmedetomidine administration were significantly shorter compared to the QTc interval values just before dexmedetomidine administration.
Group D (dexmedetomidine)	Group C (control)	Change of MAP	9862	9990	There was no significant change of MAP in either group among patients, who did not require administration of ephedrine (Fig. 1).
