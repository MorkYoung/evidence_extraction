Capsule trial, ME-3	Placebo	glutathione red-ox ratio	21328	21448	When the probiotic was consumed in capsulated form, no significant decrease was noticed in the glutathione red-ox ratio.
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	glutathione red-ox ratio	-1	-1	The effect of goat-milk consumption on the TAA and TAS values was significantlyhigher (p < 0.001) than by the consumption of the capsulated probiotic (Fig. 3). The decrease of the glutathione red-ox ratio was significant in both groups: the study Group (from 0.15 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.04 ?g/ml, p < 0.01) and control (from 0.14 ± 0.03 to 0.11 ± 0.02 ?g/ml, p < 0.01) in the goat milk trial.
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	Total Antioxidative Activity	20610	20937	The positive effect on the blood ox stress markers as TAA and TAS was seen in the case of both formulations (Fig. 3). Particularly, the additive increase in goat milk group was 6% and 9% respectively as compared to control group, however only 4% for TAA and 2.5% for TAS in probiotic capsule study group as compared to placebo.
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	glutathione red-ox ratio	21099	21327	The decrease of the glutathione red-ox ratio was significant in both groups: the study Group (from 0.15 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.04 μg/ml, p < 0.01) and control (from 0.14 ± 0.03 to 0.11 ± 0.02 μg/ml, p < 0.01) in the goat milk trial.
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	Total Antioxidative Activity	1379	1743	Faecal recovery of ME-3 was documented by molecular methods only in fermented milk group, however the significant improvement of blood TAA (Total Antioxidative Activity) and TAS (Total Antioxidative Status) indices was seen both in case of fermented goat milk and capsules", yet glutathione re-ox ratio values decreased only in case of fermented by ME-3 goat milk.
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	total fecal counts of lactobacilli	-1	-1	Increase of total fecal counts of lactobacilli in healthy volunteers consuming of ME-3 in fermented goat milk and probiotic capsule. 1 – Day 0, 2 – Day 21 Significantly different from pre-treatment values (Student's t-test): * p < 0.05; Significantly different from control (Student's t-test): ‡ p = 0.01
L. fermentum ME-3 fermented goat milk	goat milk	total fecal counts of lactobacilli	1237	1378	ME-3 was well tolerated and a significant increase in total faecal lactobacilli yet no predominance of ME-3 was detected in all study groups.
