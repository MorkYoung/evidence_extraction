PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Need of feeding tube	10688	10851	Six patients (19%) in the placebo group (n=32) and two patients (6%) in the PTA group (n=33) needed nasogastric tube feeding during the evaluation period (P=0.08).
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Candida sp. colonisation during the study	-1	-1	During the first two radiation weeks the colonisation for Candida species showed an increase in the placebo group and a decrease in the PTA group. After 2 weeks, an increase in both groups was found but the difference between the two groups remained significant during the total study period (P<0.05)
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli colonisation at 3-5 weeks	-1	-1	During the radiation period the colonisation in the PTA group was less than in the placebo group, but the difference was only significant in the second week of radiation (P=0.05)
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Mucositis throughout the study period	-1	-1	The mean mucositis was the same in the PTA group and the placebo group during the study period (P>0.2)
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Candida sp. colonisation during the study	-1	-1	The colonisation and carriage of Candida species at baseline was equal in both groups (P>0.8). During the first two radiation weeks the colonisation for Candida species showed an increase in the placebo group and a decrease in the PTA group. After 2 weeks, an increase in both groups was found but the difference between the two groups remained significant during the total study period (P<0.05)
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Weight loss	10879	11027	The mean weight loss after 5 weeks of radiation was less in the PTA group by 1.3 kg (s.d. 3.0) than in the placebo group 2.8 kg (s.d. 2.9) (P=0.05).
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli colonisation at 3-5 weeks	11576	11739	uring the first 2 weeks the carriage of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli was reduced in the PTA group (P<0.04). In weeks 3â€“5 the difference was no longer significant.
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Mucositis throughout the study period	-1	-1	The mucositis according to the WHO score did not differ throughout the study period between both groups (P>0.5). In the PTA group, 80% of the patients developed grades 3 and 4 mucositis according to the WHO score, and in the placebo group 90%.
PTA lozenge	Placebo lozenge	Need of feeding tube	-1	-1	Six patients (19%) in the placebo group (n=32) and two patients (6%) in the PTA group (n=33) needed nasogastric tube feeding during the evaluation period (P=0.08).Body weight
