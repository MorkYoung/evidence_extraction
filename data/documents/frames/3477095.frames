Hyaluronic acid + chondroitin sulfate 	Control	Pain intensity	14011	14223	Linear regressions of the absolute changes were performed on the baseline values: the most significant changes from baseline were measured at Visit 5 (6 weeks) (p = 0.0008) and at Visit 6 (12 weeks) (p = 0.0042).
Hyaluronic acid + chondroitin sulfate 	Control	Vital signs	20137	20241	No abnormality of clinical relevance was reported in vital or physical signs monitored during the study.
Hyaluronic acid + chondroitin sulfate 	Control	Functional impairment	14800	15303	Likewise, functional impairment as assessed by Lequesne's index decreased during the study: as compared to baseline, the change (mean ± SD) was -1.34 ± 3.472 at Visit 3 and -3.40 ± 4.193 at Visit 6 (12 weeks). Linear regressions of the absolute changes were performed on the baseline values: the most significant changes from baseline were measured at Visit 5 (6 weeks) (p = 0.0031) and at Visit 6 (12 weeks) (p = 0.0012). The evolution of Lequesne's algo-functional knee index is summarized in Table 4.
Hyaluronic acid + chondroitin sulfate 	Control	Severe adverse event 	19722	19780	No severe adverse event was reported throughout the study.
