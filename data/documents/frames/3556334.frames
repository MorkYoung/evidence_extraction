600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	mean weight gain	1193	1345	the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 – 4.34) versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) p 0.009
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion	24125	24388	It was observed that MTBs-induced IFN-g levels in the 25-hydroxyvitamin D intervention group were increased post-therapy (p = 0.022, Figure  <NEWLINE>3). However, no difference was observed in MTBs-induced IFN-g levels compared between 0 and 12 weeks in the placebo group.
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	number of zones involved	19575	19764	Interpretation of chest radiographs at 12 weeks showed that the mean number of zones involved in the vitamin D arm were 1.35 v/s 1.82 zones in the placebo arm (p 0.004) (95% CI 0.15, 0.79).
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	cavity size	19765	19893	106 (89.8%) patients in the vitamin D arm had 50% or more reduction in cavity size v/s 111 (94.8%) in the placebo arm (p 0.035).
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	mean weight gain	19172	19573	Changes in serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels in the two groups is shown in Additional file <NEWLINE>1: Figure S1. After 12 weeks of antituberculous therapy, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplemented arm had a mean weight gain (kg) of; + 3.75 (3.16 – 4.34) v/s + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) in the placebo arm (p 0.009) and in BMI; + 1.39 (95% CI 1.15 – 1.63) v/s + 0.95 (95% CI 0.71 – 1.19) in the placebo arm (p 0.01)
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	cavity size	1193	1543	the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 – 4.34) versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) p 0.009 and lesser residual disease by chest radiograph; number of zones involved 1.35 v/s 1.82 p 0.004 (95% CI 0.15, 0.79) and 50% or greater reduction in cavity size 106 (89.8%) v/s 111 (94.8%), p 0.035.
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	number of zones involved	1177	1543	After 12 weeks, the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 – 4.34) versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 – 3.23) p 0.009 and lesser residual disease by chest radiograph; number of zones involved 1.35 v/s 1.82 p 0.004 (95% CI 0.15, 0.79) and 50% or greater reduction in cavity size 106 (89.8%) v/s 111 (94.8%), p 0.035.
600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3	placebo for 2 doses	MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion	25622	25841	Increase in MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion after therapy occurred only in subjects with Deficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (p = 0.021, Figure  <NEWLINE>5B) in the drug intervention group but not in the placebo group, Figure  <NEWLINE>5A.
