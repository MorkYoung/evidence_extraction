bisoprolol	losartan/ amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide	slightly elevated body mass index	16752	16857	The patients were all males, had a slightly elevated body mass index (none had body mass index >32 kg/m2)
bisoprolol	losartan/ amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide	reduced kidney glomerular filtration rate	16912	16994	No patient had drug‐treated diabetes or reduced kidney glomerular filtration rate.
bisoprolol	losartan/ amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide	SNPs on chromosome 11 (rs2514036, rs948445, and rs2514037) provided evidence for association reaching genome‐wide significance for ASBP (systolic blood pressure) response	18313	18645	genome‐wide associations of ≈630 000 SNPs with the antihypertensive responses to losartan, bisoprolol, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide are illustrated in Figure 1. Three SNPs on chromosome 11 (rs2514036, rs948445, and rs2514037) provided evidence for association reaching genome‐wide significance for ASBP response to bisoprolol
