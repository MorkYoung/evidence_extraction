cranberry juices	nothing	14 (poly)phenol metabolites	11449	12040	The linear dose response for each plasma metabolite was assessed and of the 60 identified metabolites, 14 (poly)phenol metabolites displayed a linear dose-response curve (r2 ≥ 0.89) in plasma (Figure 1) with slopes significantly different from zero (p < 0.05): caffeic acid 4-O-ß-d-glucuronide and quercetin-3-O-ß-d-glucuronide displayed r2 > 0.98, while ferulic acid 4-O-ß-d-glucuronide, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid 3-O-ß-d-glucuronide, sinapic acid, ferulic acid 4-O-sulfate, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and syringic acid exhibited r2 > 0.90.
cranberry juices	nothing	14 (poly)phenol metabolites	10366	10732	The time to reach Cmax (Tmax) varied depending on the metabolite and depending on the amount of (poly)phenols in the juice (Supplementary Figure S1). The level of TP in cranberry juice seemed to impact the Tmax of individual metabolites, for example the Tmax for 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid varied between 7.2 h (409 mg TP juice) and 13.8 h (787 mg TP juice).
cranberry juices	nothing	12 (poly)phenol metabolites	14161	14455	A positive, linear dose response for total excretion over 24 h of each urinary metabolite was assessed and of the 60 identified metabolites, 12 (poly)phenol metabolites displayed a positive linear dose-response curve (r2 ≥ 0.66) in urine with slopes significantly different from zero (p < 0.05)

The AUC for flavonols produced the highest r2 (0.97, p < 0.001), followed by the valerolactones (r2 = 0.89, p < 0.005), benzoic acids (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01), cinnamic acids (r2 = 0.72, p < 0.05), phenylacetic acids (r2 = 0.71, p < 0.05), benzaldehydes (r2 = 0.65, p < 0.05); hippuric acids, pyrogallols, and catechols did not show a linear dose response.
