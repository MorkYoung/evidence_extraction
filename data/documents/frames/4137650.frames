Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean rate pressure product up to 15 min after intubation	13522	14024	In our study the RPP during intubation revealed a highly significant increase in Group C (76.5%, P < 0.0001) and significant increase in Group E (49%, P < 0.001), whereas the increase was insignificant in Group D (16%, P > 0.0666). These changes were highly significant up to 15 min post-intubation. Although comparing Group E to Group D the increase in RPP in Group E at the time of intubation (P < 0.001) was statistically significant. The rise in mean RPP was least in Group D and highest in Group C
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean systolic arterial pressure after intubation	1450	1663	The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001) and esmolol (P < 0.0001) after laryngoscopy and intubation compared with baseline value and Group D (P = 0.6294). T
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean arterial pressure after laryngoscopy and intubation	1450	1661	The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001) and esmolol (P < 0.0001) after laryngoscopy and intubation compared with baseline value and Group D (P = 0.6294).
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean diastolic arterial pressure after intubation	12476	12577	The DAP levels in Group D were significantly lower than Groups C and E at all times after intubation.
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean arterial pressure after laryngoscopy and intubation	1450	1660	The mean arterial pressure was significantly increased in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001) and esmolol (P < 0.0001) after laryngoscopy and intubation compared with baseline value and Group D (P = 0.6294)
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean heart rate after intubation	11669	11957	The increase in mean HR after intubation was seen in all the three groups. But the mean increase was minimal 5.83% in Group D (4 beats, P = 0.0848), when compared with Group E 14% (9.81beats; P = 0.0152) and Group C 30% (24.9 beats; P < 0.0001), which was highly significant (P < 0.0001).
Placebo (Group C) and esmolol (Group E)	Dexmedetomidine (Group D)	Mean systolic arterial pressure after intubation	12055	12225	The mean SAP levels in Group D were significantly lower than Groups C and E immediately after intubation (P < 0.001, P > 0.001 respectively) and until the end of surgery.
