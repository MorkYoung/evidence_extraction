800 mg/day imatinib	400 mg/day imatinib	anemia and fatigue	9202	9456	In an analysis of the tolerability profile before versus after crossover from the 400 to the 800 mg/day arm (in the EORTC phase III trial), the incidences of anemia and fatigue were significantly increased, with 12.8% (P = 0 .015 versus before crossover)
800 mg/day imatinib	400 mg/day imatinib	grade 3–4 neutropenia	9529	9649	On the other hand, no increase in grade 3–4 neutropenia was documented after crossover to the higher dosage (P = 0.002).
800 mg/day imatinib	400 mg/day imatinib	anemia and fatigue	9128	9526	The side effect profile of imatinib may improve with prolonged therapy.19 In an analysis of the tolerability profile before versus after crossover from the 400 to the 800 mg/day arm (in the EORTC phase III trial), the incidences of anemia and fatigue were significantly increased, with 12.8% (P = 0 .015 versus before crossover) and 7.5% (P = 0.00001) of patients experiencing new grade 3⁄4 events.
