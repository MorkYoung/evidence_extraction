TSH ≥2.2 μIU/mL	TSH<2.2 μIU/mL	Risk of prostate cancer	1039	1190	Men with serum higher TSH had a decreased risk of prostate cancer compared to men with lower TSH (Q5 vs. Q1–4: OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.97, p = 0.03).
TSH ≥2.2 μIU/mL	TSH<2.2 μIU/mL	Risk of prostate cancer	23125	23376	Combining quintiles 1–4 for a referent category showed that men with TSH ≥2.2 μIU/mL had a statistically significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer compared to men with TSH<2.2 μIU/mL (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.97, p = 0.03).
