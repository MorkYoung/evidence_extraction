acarbose	pioglitazone	urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)	1082	1245	After 6 months of treatment, the mean changes in UACR were −18 ± 104 and 12 ± 85 (p = 0.25, between groups) for the acarbose and pioglitazone groups, respectively.
pioglitazone	acarbose	body weight	-1	-1	Significant body weight gain was observed in the pioglitazone group as compared with the acarbose group (1.3 ± 2.8 vs. −0.6 ± 1.5 kg, p = 0.002).<NEWLINE> <NEWLINE><NEWLINE> <NEWLINE><NEWLINE> <NEWLINE>Conclusion
pioglitazone	acarbose	edema	16101	16213	However in the pioglitazone group, more patients had edema (Acarbose vs. Pioglitazone: 3.3% vs. 36.7%, p <0.001)
acarbose	pioglitazone	glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)	1246	1392	The mean changes in eGFR were 0 ± 14 and −7 ± 16 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.09, between groups) for the acarbose and pioglitazone groups, respectively.
acarbose	pioglitazone	rates of minor to moderate hypoglycemia	15736	15916	The overall rates of minor to moderate hypoglycemia showed no significant difference between two groups (Acarbose vs. Pioglitazone: 1.37 ± 1.16 vs. 1.87 ± 1.48 episodes, p = 0.51).
pioglitazone	acarbose	body weight	16218	16310	body weight increase (Acarbose vs. Pioglitazone: −0.6 ± 1.5 kg vs. 1.3 ± 2.8 kg, p = 0.002).
