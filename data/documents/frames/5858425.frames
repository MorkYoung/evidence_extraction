Intervention group (IG) with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks	control group (CG) received lessons as usual	descriptive improvements post measurement	16785	16905	Based on the pre-measurement, descriptive improvements could be found at post measurement for the IG compared to the CG.
Intervention group (IG) with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks	control group (CG) received lessons as usual	mean changes for the digit span task	16474	16784	For the digit span task, the number of correct trials, both groups improved moderately over time (forward: F(1; 36) = 3.41, p = 0.07, ηp2 = 0.09; backward: F(1; 36) = 3.50, p = 0.07, ηp2 = 0.09). No group influence (IG vs. CG) could be observed from the first measurement point to the second measurement point.
Intervention group (IG) with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks	control group (CG) received lessons as usual	standing time	732	855	The standing time of the IG was higher during the school day in comparison to the CG (lesson: p = 0.004; break: p = 0.003).
Intervention group (IG) with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks	control group (CG) received lessons as usual	sitting time	14887	14986	. The measured sitting and standing time of the IG during lessons differed in comparison to the CG.
Intervention group (IG) with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks	control group (CG) received lessons as usual	sitting time	18336	18725	Compared to the CG, the IG sat 13 min less per day (65 min per week). Effect sizes ranged between 0.75 and 1.04. This resembles results of other studies applying standing desks to pupils, summarized in a review by Minges et al. [32] They found notable standing time increases (effect sizes: 0.38–0.71), while weekly sitting time decreased by approximately 60 min (effect sizes: 0.27–0.49).
