resistance training (3x/wk)	standard of care (controls)	muscle glycogen	18048	18221	In contrast, control subjects showed a mean reduction in muscle glycogen equivalent to 13% (from 66.7 ± 10.4 to 57.7 ± 21.4 mmol glucose/kg muscle, P = 0.04 vs. exercisers).
resistance training (3x/wk)	standard of care (controls)	hSGLT3 transcript levels in skeletal muscle	14868	15119	As shown in Figure 1, the median relative expression ratio (2-ΔΔCt) of hSGLT3 transcript levels in skeletal muscle increased by a factor of 10.02 after 16 weeks of progressive resistance exercise training compared to control subjects (0.10, P = 0.03).
resistance training (3x/wk)	standard of care (controls)	muscle glycogen	17893	18221	In the exercise group, muscle glycogen increased by 44% (from 60.2 ± 16.9 to 83.2 ± 21.8 mmol glucose/kg muscle, before and after exercise, respectively). In contrast, control subjects showed a mean reduction in muscle glycogen equivalent to 13% (from 66.7 ± 10.4 to 57.7 ± 21.4 mmol glucose/kg muscle, P = 0.04 vs. exercisers).
resistance training (3x/wk)	standard of care (controls)	whole-body muscle strength	18695	18826	Exercisers gained on average 43 ± 29% of whole-body muscle strength, as compared to a 19 ± 31% loss in control subjects (P = 0.01).
