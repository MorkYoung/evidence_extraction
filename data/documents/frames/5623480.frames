in-hospital administration of ticagrelor	Prehospital administration of ticagrelor	Primary outcome: the proportion of patients who did not have 70% resolution of ST-segment elevation and did not meet the criteria for Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow 3 at initial angiography. Secondary outcome: the composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke or urgent revascularisation and major or minor bleeding at 30 days.	22282	22451	Prehospital administration of ticagrelor compared with in-hospital administration resulted in a non-significant difference in the primary, secondary and safety outcomes.

Secondary outcome: the composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke or urgent revascularisation and major or minor bleeding at 30 days.	22452	22908	No significant interactions between randomised treatment and gender in terms of these outcomes were found in the unadjusted or adjusted model (test for interaction in the multivariable models; p=0.94 for all-cause mortality, p=0.55 for absence of TIMI flow grade 3 in the IRA at initial angiography, p=0.71 for absence of ≥70% resolution of pre-PCI ST-segment elevation, and p=0.31 for TIMI major bleeding at 30 days) (see online supplementary tables 1–3).
