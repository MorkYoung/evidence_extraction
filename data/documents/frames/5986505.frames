Virgin olive oil (VOO) and Optimized virgin olive oil (OVOO)	Functional olive oil (FOO)	Fasting plasma triacylglycerol levels	18179	18347	Fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentrations increased after the VOO and OVOO interventions (p = 0.037 and p = 0.002, respectively) but not after the FOO intervention.
Virgin olive oil (VOO)	Optimized virgin olive oil (OVOO) and functional olive oil (FOO)	HDLc levels	17831	18089	When comparing pre- vs. post-intervention data (intra-treatment effect), HDLc levels significantly increased only after the OVOO intervention (p = 0.041), and only in females (p = 0.005). However, no differences were observed between the three interventions.
