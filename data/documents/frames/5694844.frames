3M bulk fill	Z250 conventional composite	Microleakage of Two Bulk Fill and One Conventional Composite in Class II Restorations of Primary Posterior Teeth	12310	12688	No significant difference was noted among the three groups in terms of microleakage in the gingival (P=0.252) or occlusal (P=0.516) margins (Table 2). Microleakage (dye penetration depth) in the gingival margin of all groups was significantly greater than that in the occlusal margin (P=0.001 for 3M bulk fill, P=0.049 for SonicFill and P=0.001 for Z250 conventional composite).
3M bulk fill	Z250 conventional composite	Microleakage of Two Bulk Fill and One Conventional Composite in Class II Restorations of Primary Posterior Teeth	19721	19969	Bulk fill composites have similar properties to conventional composites in terms of microleakage and may be preferred for class II restoration of primary posterior teeth to decrease working time given that their other properties are also favorable.
