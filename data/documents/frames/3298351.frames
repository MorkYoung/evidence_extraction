ProGuide system	Profore compression	venous ulcer healing	14464	14821	In the group of patients who used Maxis compression stockings complete healing was achieved in 8 (53.3%) ulcerations, in the groups of patients treated with layer compression systems, complete healing was achieved in 10 (62.5%) ulcerations treated with the two-layer compression system and 9 (60%) ulcerations treated with the four-layer compression system.
two-layer bandage	compression stocking	CEAP scores	16495	17230	Together with the progress in ulceration healing, statistically significant changes in CEAP scoring values (Table III) were observed. The difference in average CEAP C-6 score of all patients was 3.6 points and was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Also, in groups of patients divided according to the type of compression therapy, the differences in CEAP scoring values were statistically significant; they gained 3.5 points among patients who used compression stockings, 3.5 points among patients treated with the ProGuide system, and 4.3 points among patients treated with the Profore system. The statistical analysis did not reveal any statistically significant intra-group differences (Kruskal-Wallis test H = 3.102, p > 0.05).
four-layer bandage	compression stocking	venous ulcer healing	-1	-1	In all patients, independently of the type of compression therapy, a few significant statistical changes of ulceration area in time were observed (Student?s t test for matched pairs, p < 0.05). The largest loss of ulceration area in each of the successive measurements was observed in patients treated with the four-layer system ? on average 0.63 cm2/per week. The smallest loss of ulceration area was observed in patients using compression stockings ? on average 0.44 cm2/per week. However, the observed differences were not statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis test H = 4.45, p > 0.05).
