Exercise trial in hypoxia (HYP-Ex)	Exercise trial in normoxia (NOR-Ex)	Serum FFA over 7.5 hours	16262	16353	FFA responses did not differ significantly between the NOR-Ex and HYP-Ex trials over 7.5 h.
Hypoxic trials	Normoxic trials	Blood glucose concentrations over 7.5 hours	948	1073	The areas under the curves for blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations over 7.5 h did not differ among the four trials
Hypoxic trials	Normoxic trials	Blood glucose concentrations over 7.5 hours	1459	1626	Three sessions of 30 min exercise (60% of VO2max) in moderate hypoxia over 7.5 h did not attenuate postprandial glucose and insulin responses in young, overweight men.
