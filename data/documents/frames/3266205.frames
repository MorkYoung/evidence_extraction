Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	total sulfate, S-adenosylmethionine	986	1142	Statistically significant improvements in metabolic status were many including: total sulfate (+17%, p = 0.001), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; +6%, p = 0.003),
Vitamin/mineral supplements	placebo	Parental Global Impressions-Revised, and on the subscores for Hyperactivity, Tantrumming , Overall , and Receptive Language	1456	1749	The supplement group had significantly greater improvements than the placebo group on the Parental Global Impressions-Revised (PGI-R, Average Change, p = 0.008), and on the subscores for Hyperactivity (p = 0.003), Tantrumming (p = 0.009), Overall (p = 0.02), and Receptive Language (p = 0.03).
Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	glutathione, ratio of oxidized glutathione	1143	1263	reduced glutathione (+17%, p = 0.0008), ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH; -27%, p = 0.002)
Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	nitrotyrosine, ATP , NADH , and NADPH	1265	1377	nitrotyrosine (-29%, p = 0.004), ATP (+25%, p = 0.000001), NADH (+28%, p = 0.0002), and NADPH (+30%, p = 0.001).
Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	total sulfate, S-adenosylmethionine	49777	49909	After treatment, there was a significant increase in total sulfate, and a large and marginally significant increase in free sulfate.
Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	glutathione, ratio of oxidized glutathione	986	1264	Statistically significant improvements in metabolic status were many including: total sulfate (+17%, p = 0.001), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; +6%, p = 0.003), reduced glutathione (+17%, p = 0.0008), ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH; -27%, p = 0.002),
Vitamin/mineral supplements	baseline	nitrotyrosine, ATP , NADH , and NADPH	986	1454	Statistically significant improvements in metabolic status were many including: total sulfate (+17%, p = 0.001), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; +6%, p = 0.003), reduced glutathione (+17%, p = 0.0008), ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH; -27%, p = 0.002), nitrotyrosine (-29%, p = 0.004), ATP (+25%, p = 0.000001), NADH (+28%, p = 0.0002), and NADPH (+30%, p = 0.001). Most of these metabolic biomarkers improved to normal or near-normal levels.
