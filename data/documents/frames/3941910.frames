BAP + kinetin + NAA	BAP+ NAA	Shoot proliferation	14821	14990	In this experiment, the shoot tip explants in MS media containing different concentrations of BAP + kinetin + NAA had greater effect than BAP+ NAA on shoot proliferation
MS medium containing 1.5 mg/L kinetin + 0.15 mg/L NAA	kinetin (1.5 mg/L) + NAA (0.3 mg/L), and/or MS media containing 0.15 mg/L NAA along with kinetin 1.5 or 2.0 mg/L	Number of proliferated shoots	8378	8799	Analysis of the effect of different concentrations of kinetin and NAA showed that the number of proliferated shoots in MS medium containing 1.5 mg/L kinetin + 0.15 mg/L NAA had no statistically significant difference from the number of proliferated shoots in MS media containing kinetin (1.5 mg/L) + NAA (0.3 mg/L), and/or MS media containing 0.15 mg/L NAA along with kinetin 1.5 or 2.0 mg/L, but it was more than others.
BAP + kinetin + NAA	BAP+ NAA	Shoot proliferation	10782	11053	Analysis of the interactive effect of NAA, kinetin and BAP on shoot proliferation showed that most of the proliferated shoots produced in MS medium containing 1.0 mg/L BAP + 1.0 mg/L kinetin + 0.15 mg/L NAA had a statistically significant difference from other treatments
