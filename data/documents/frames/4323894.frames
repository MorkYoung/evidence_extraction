Mild-cooling or deep-cooling	No cooling	Rate of complications	20648	20896	Kruskal Wallis non-parametric statistical test comparing the three groups for complication disclosed insignificant difference with P = 0.405. In conclusion, no significant difference is found in the incidence of complication among the three groups.
Deep-cooling	Mild-cooling	Improvement in Glasgow outcome score at 6 months post-trauma	1636	1759	the deep-cooling-treated patients failed to be better than either no cooling (P = 0.074) or mild cooling group (P = 0.650).
Deep-cooling	Mild-cooling	Improvement in Glasgow outcome score at 6 months post-trauma	1325	1759	here were 63.2% of patients in cooling group attained good GOS at 6 months compared to only 15.4% in noncooling group (P = 0.007). Interestingly, the analysis at 6 months post-trauma disclosed mild-cooling-treated patients did better than no cooling (70% vs. 15.4% attained good GOS, P = 0.013) and apparently, the deep-cooling-treated patients failed to be better than either no cooling (P = 0.074) or mild cooling group (P = 0.650).
Mild-cooling	No cooling	Improvement in Glasgow outcome score at 6 months post-trauma	1471	1619	the analysis at 6 months post-trauma disclosed mild-cooling-treated patients did better than no cooling (70% vs. 15.4% attained good GOS, P = 0.013)
