Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Schirmer test values in women	-1	-1	There is no significant difference between the dry eye test values of the 2 groups of female patients on days 1, 7, and 30 after cataract operation.
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Chronic fatigue syndrome values	-1	-1	CFS values of the patients in the study group were superior to that of the patients in the control group 1 week after operation, and a significant difference was found between the 2 groups (∗P = .032).
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Schirmer test values in men	-1	-1	The ST-I value of male patients in the study group at 1-week postoperation was higher than that of male patients in the control group (∗P = .019)
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Schirmer test values in women	-1	-1	Comparison of dry eye measurements (ST-I, BUT, CFS) for the female patients between the 2 groups at different time points. There is no significant difference between the dry eye test values of the 2 groups of female patients on days 1, 7, and 30 after cataract operation.
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Schirmer test values in men	11403	11620	the value of ST-I was 19.65 ± 9.14 mm in the male patients in the study group and 13.43 ± 9.26 mm in the male patients in the control group at 1 week after the surgery, with a significant difference (P = .019; Fig. 2)
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 	Control	Chronic fatigue syndrome values	-1	-1	Comparison of measurements for the crowd of preoperatively dry eye patients whose surgery time is longer than median between the 2 groups at different time points. CFS values of the patients in the study group were superior to that of the patients in the control group 1 week after operation, and a significant difference was found between the 2 groups (∗P = .032).
