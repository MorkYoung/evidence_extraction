Fiber enriched flour	Normal flour	LDL	12326	12535	A significant decrease in LDL cholesterol concentration was observed in Group A and Group B after the fiber-enriched period (Group A: –13.27 mg/dl, p<0.01 vs placebo; Group B –12.63 mg/dl, p = 0.002 vs basal).
Fiber enriched flour	Normal flour	Weight after 8 weeks	10115	10730	Weight and BMI resulted significantly lower in Group A after the 4-week placebo period (change from baseline –1.35 kg, p<0.01; –0.57 kg/m2, p<0.01, respectively). We observed a further decrease in weight and BMI in this group after the period of fiber-enriched diet (change from placebo –1.4 kg, p = 0.01; –0.22 kg/m2, p = 0.02, respectively). In Group B we observed a significant reduction of weight and BMI after the fiber enriched period (change from baseline –1.52 kg, p<0.01; –0.58 kg/m2, p<0.01, respectively), and an additional slight decrease of weight after the period of placebo diet (–0.78 kg, p = 0.05).

Fiber enriched flour	Normal flour	Fasting insuline	11268	11380	Fasting glucose and fasting insulin did not change significantly in both groups during the 8 weeks of the study.

Fiber enriched flour	Normal flour	Weight after 8 weeks	1020	1136	At the end of the 8 weeks, weight and BMI further decreased in the group consuming the fiber-enriched diet (p<0.01).
Fiber enriched flour	Normal flour	Insulin resistance	1137	1348	Insulin resistance, estimated with the Homeostasis Model Assessment index and the Lipid Accumulation Product index, improved in all subjects after the fiber-enriched flour diet (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, respectively)
