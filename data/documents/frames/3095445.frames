Naftopidil 50 mg	Control	Storage score improvement	9175	9340	In the 50 mg group, all of these scores reduced 4 weeks after treatment compared with those at baseline (P = .004, P = .015, P = .020, P = .041, and P < .001, resp.)
Naftopidil 75 mg	Control	Voiding score improvement	8566	9020	The alteration of the total IPSS, storage score, voiding score, postmicturition score (domain for feeling of incomplete emptying), and QOL score was presented in Figures 1(a)â€“1(e). The 75 mg group showed improvement in all of these in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (baseline versus 4 weeks after treatment: P < .001 in all; 4 weeks after treatment versus 8 weeks after treatment: P = .019, P = .057, P = .047, P = .057, and P = .003, resp.),
Naftopidil 75 mg	Control	Postmicturition score improvement	8747	9174	The 75 mg group showed improvement in all of these in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (baseline versus 4 weeks after treatment: P < .001 in all; 4 weeks after treatment versus 8 weeks after treatment: P = .019, P = .057, P = .047, P = .057, and P = .003, resp.), although the difference in the storage and postmicturition scores were of borderline significance between at 4 weeks and 8 weeks (Figures 1(b) and 1(d)).
Naftopidil 75 mg	Control	Postmicturition score improvement	8747	8901	The 75 mg group showed improvement in all of these in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (baseline versus 4 weeks after treatment: P < .001 in all
Naftopidil 75 mg	Control	Voiding score improvement	8747	8894	The 75 mg group showed improvement in all of these in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (baseline versus 4 weeks after treatment: P < .001
Naftopidil 50 mg	Control	Postmicturition score improvement	9175	9340	In the 50 mg group, all of these scores reduced 4 weeks after treatment compared with those at baseline (P = .004, P = .015, P = .020, P = .041, and P < .001, resp.)
