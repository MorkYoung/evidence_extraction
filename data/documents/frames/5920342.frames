Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Loss of blood during surgery	655	740	the blood loss during the operation was less than that of the control group (P<0.05).
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Height of intervertebral space after 1 year	10577	10728	The intervertebral space height in observation group at 1 year after operation was significantly higher than that in control group (P<0.05; Table III).
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Operation time	532	650	. Results showed that the operation time of the observation group was shorter than that of the control group (P<0.05),
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Height of intervertebral space after 1 year	10432	10728	There was no statistically significant difference in the comparison of intervertebral space height between two groups before operation (P>0.05). The intervertebral space height in observation group at 1 year after operation was significantly higher than that in control group (P<0.05; Table III).
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Time of hospitalization after the surgery	741	834	The length of postoperative hospital stay was shorter than that of the control group (P<0.05)
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Time of hospitalization after the surgery	8668	9094	The operation time in observation group (65.5±2.1 min) was shorter than that in control group (76.5±3.2 min) (t=18.176, P<0.05); the intraoperative blood loss amount in observation group (28.9±1.7 ml) was less than that in control group (56.8±5.6 ml) (t=30.151, P<0.05); the postoperative hospitalization time in observation group (5.9±1.1 days) was shorter than that in control group (8.1±1.5 days) (t=7.378, P<0.05; Fig. 1).
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Loss of blood during surgery	8797	8938	the intraoperative blood loss amount in observation group (28.9±1.7 ml) was less than that in control group (56.8±5.6 ml) (t=30.151, P<0.05);
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Operation time	534	649	Results showed that the operation time of the observation group was shorter than that of the control group (P<0.05)
Soleus muscle H-reflex monitoring	No monitoring	Soleus muscle latency and amplitude of H-reflex latency	1139	1358	The latency and amplitude of H-reflex latency in soleus muscle were significantly lower (P<0.05), and the height of intervertebral space in observation group was significantly higher than that in control group (P<0.05).
