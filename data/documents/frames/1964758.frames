Initial Nottingham TSR design prosthesis	BioModular® shoulder prosthesis	8-year survivorship	18184	18353	The eight year survivorship of the initial Nottingham TSR design (Group 2) was higher (p < 0.001) than observed in Group 1 patients with implanted BioModular® prostheses
Redesigned Nottingham TSR prosthesis	BioModular® shoulder prosthesis	4-year survivorship	21446	21843	The observed four-year survivorship of the patients in Group 3 was also significantly higher than the survivorship rates of the BioModular® prosthesis observed after the first four years after implantation (p = 0.02), with a 93.1% cumulative four year survivorship of the re-designed Nottingham TSR (Fig 10) comparing to the 80.9% of cumulative four year survivorship of the BioModular® prosthesis
Initial Nottingham TSR design prosthesis	BioModular® shoulder prosthesis	8-year survivorship in patients with osteoarthritis	21089	21433	The initial Nottingham TSR prostheses showed higher eight year survivorship than BioModular® prostheses in patients with OA (p < 0.01). Survivorship of the BioModular® prosthesis in patients with primary osteoarthritis was 70.9% and 64.3% at five and eight years respectively and for the initial Nottingham TSR these values were 84.5% and 80.4%
