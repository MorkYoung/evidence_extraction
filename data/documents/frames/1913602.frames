Improved cookstove	Control	Diastolic blood pressure 	20548	20724	After adjustment, the plancha improved stove was associated with 3.7 mm Hg lower SBP [95% confidence interval (CI), −8.1 to 0.6] and 3.0 mm Hg lower DBP (95% CI, −5.7 to −0.4),
Improved cookstove	Control	Personal PM 2.5	20110	20261	Personal PM2.5 was about 61% lower on average and had a narrower distribution among the plancha improved stove group compared with the open fire group.
Improved cookstove	Control	Systolic blood pressure 	20548	20723	After adjustment, the plancha improved stove was associated with 3.7 mm Hg lower SBP [95% confidence interval (CI), −8.1 to 0.6] and 3.0 mm Hg lower DBP (95% CI, −5.7 to −0.4)
Improved cookstove + smoking	Improved cookstove + No smoking	Systolic blood pressure 	20770	20965	Excluding smokers did not alter the results, and there was no significant interaction between intervention and ever smoking nor intervention and SHS exposure for either BP measure (all p > 0.25).
Improved cookstove + smoking	Improved cookstove + No smoking	Diastolic blood pressure 	22144	22468	the echo-intervention was associated with a 3.1 mm Hg decline in SBP (95% CI, −5.3 to −0.8) and a 1.9 mm Hg decline in DBP (95% CI, −3.5 to −0.4). Excluding smokers did not alter the results, and there was no significant interaction between stove and ever smoking nor stove and SHS exposure for either BP measure (p > 0.25).
