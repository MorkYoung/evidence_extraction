Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Probability of being free of BV relapse (survival analysis of Kaplan Meyer)	15843	16212	The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Fig. 2), probability of being free of BV relapse in the two groups during the period of prophylaxis, became statistically significant starting from the 5-month time point (P = 0.039 vitamin C vs. placebo, log-rank test); the significant difference was maintained and increased at the 6-month evaluation (end of treatment, P = 0.029).
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis	13973	14203	he two groups were homogeneous for age, height and weight distribution. BV signs and symptoms (itching, burning, dysuria, odour, erythema, oedema and fissures) were fairly similar across treatment groups, as summarised in Table 1.
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Probability of being free of BV relapse (survival analysis of Kaplan Meyer)	1716	1847	the survival analysis of Kaplan Meyer was significant in favour of the vitamin C group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.029).
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis	16284	16506	BV signs and symptoms did not show any statistically significant differences through the treatment study period (from baseline to the follow-up visit), or in comparison of the treatment groups at the evaluated time points.
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Recurrence of bacterial vaginosis after 6 months	1520	1681	Considering a 6-month treatment period, the recurrence rate in the vitamin C group (16.2%) was significantly lower (P = 0.024) than in the placebo group (32.4%).
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Baseline characteristics 	13972	14044	The two groups were homogeneous for age, height and weight distribution.
Vaginal vitamin C	Placebo	Signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis	14045	14176	BV signs and symptoms (itching, burning, dysuria, odour, erythema, oedema and fissures) were fairly similar across treatment groups
