Regorafenib (RE)	placebo	progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)	8057	8727	The study met its primary endpoint, showing statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) by 29% (HR = 0.77, p = 0.0052, median OS: 6.4 months vs. 5.0 months for the placebo group) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose disease had progressed after approved standard therapies. Additionally, findings from the secondary endpoints of the CORRECT study showed statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.49, p < 0.000001, median PFS: 1.9 months vs. 1.7 months) and an improvement in disease control rate (44.8% vs. 15.3%) in patients treated with regorafenib compared to those treated with placebo.

Regorafenib (RE)	placebo	overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)	7939	8371	Treatment cycles consisted of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching placebo) once daily for three weeks on/one week off. The study met its primary endpoint, showing statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) by 29% (HR = 0.77, p = 0.0052, median OS: 6.4 months vs. 5.0 months for the placebo group) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose disease had progressed after approved standard therapies.
