Risedronate 5 mg	Placebo	Hip fracture frequency	8909	9066	Compared with placebo, risedronate 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg once daily reduced the risk of hip fracture by 46% (relative risk [RR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.32–0.91; P = 0.019)
Risedronate 5 mg	Placebo	Hip fracture frequency	1099	1284	After 3 years, hip fracture had occurred in 3.8% of risedronate-treated patients and 7.4% of placebo-treated patients (relative risk 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.91; P = 0.019).
