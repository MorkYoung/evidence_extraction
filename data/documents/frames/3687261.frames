d-xylose	sucralose	plasma GLP-1 before consuming the meal	1365	1541	Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d-xylose than control only before the meal (P < 0.05) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin (P < 0.05).
sitagliptin and d-xylose	placebo and sucralose	peak blood glucose	971	1202	Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P < 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P < 0.05 for each), while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC (P < 0.05).
