laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) group 1	primary trabeculectomy group 2	Cataract progression	12480	12667	Cataract progression as defined was documented in 2 eyes (5.3%, CI: −1.8%–12.4%) in group 1 and 16 eyes (14.4%, CI: 7.9%–20.9%) in group 2 (Pearson's chi-square value = 2.232, p = 0.135).
laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) group 1	primary trabeculectomy group 2	intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications	-1	-1	Five eyes in group 1 required trabeculectomy: 1 eye at 6 months, 2 eyes at 12 months, and 2 eyes at 18 months. 17 of the 38 eyes (44.7%, CI: 28.9%–60.5%) in group 1 required a mean of 1.8 IOP-lowering medications while seven of the 111 eyes (6.3%, CI: 1.8%–10.8%) in group 2 required a mean of 1.1 medications (Pearson's chi-square value?=?30.940, p < 0.001).
laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) group 1	primary trabeculectomy group 2	intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications	1054	1180	17 of the 38 eyes in group 1 (44.7%) required IOP-lowering medications as compared to seven of the 111 eyes in group 2 (6.3%).
laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) group 1	primary trabeculectomy group 2	The absolute risk for ?2 lost lines of vision	12244	12381	The absolute risk for ≥2 lost lines of vision in the trabeculectomy group was 18% (20 of 111) compared to 16% (6 of 38) in the LPI group.
