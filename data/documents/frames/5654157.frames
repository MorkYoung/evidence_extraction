Among distant failure sites, lung and brain were the two most common. There was no significant difference in loco-regional or distant failure rates among the four arms. In the EGFR-mutant groups, the locoregional and distant failure rates were 27.3% and 63.3%, respectively, while they were 39.4% and 42.4% in the EGFR wild-type or unknown groups (p=0.463).
