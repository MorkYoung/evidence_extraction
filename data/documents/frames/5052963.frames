Metacognitive therapy (MCT)	control group received training in applied relaxation (AR)	Changes on clinical global impression scale-severity (CGI-S) - in social anxiety disorder (SAD)	12860	13018	Changes on CGI-S were higher in patients receiving MCT (60%) as compared to AR (50%), further supporting the effectiveness of MCT in reducing symptom severity
