Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg	Control	Joint damage progession	23970	24178	patients who had SJC>1 at 1 year showed significantly less progression of joint damage upon treatment with TCZ (0.4±1.2 in the 4 mg/kg and 0.3±1.0 in the 8 mg/kg arm) compared with placebo (0.9±1.8; p=0.009);
Tocilizumab	Control	Change of TGSS	1411	1522	Change of TGSS was lower in patients receiving TCZ than placebo (TCZ: 0.29±0.96; placebo: 0.90±1.92; p=0.0007).
Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg	Control	Joint damage progession	23389	23570	significantly less progression of joint damage was seen in those receiving TCZ 4 mg/kg (0.24±0.78) and 8 mg/kg TCZ (0.34±0.88) than in patients receiving placebo (1.03±2.07; p=0.015
Tocilizumab	Control	Difference in radiographic progression	17858	18088	when comparing placebo with TCZ-treated patients, differences in disease activity are unlikely to explain the observed threefold difference in radiographic progression (mean change 1.2±2.2 for placebo and 0.4±1.2 for TCZ, p=0.0009
Tocilizumab	Control	Change of TGSS	1411	1521	Change of TGSS was lower in patients receiving TCZ than placebo (TCZ: 0.29±0.96; placebo: 0.90±1.92; p=0.0007)
Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg	Control	Joint damage progession	23389	23570	significantly less progression of joint damage was seen in those receiving TCZ 4 mg/kg (0.24±0.78) and 8 mg/kg TCZ (0.34±0.88) than in patients receiving placebo (1.03±2.07; p=0.015
Tocilizumab	Control	Difference in radiographic progression	1411	1952	Change of TGSS was lower in patients receiving TCZ than placebo (TCZ: 0.29±0.96; placebo: 0.90±1.92; p=0.0007). In patients receiving placebo, the correlation with TGSS change was significant for baseline scores of the simplified disease activity index (SDAI; r=0.18, p=0.047) and swollen joint count 28 (r=0.22, p=0.019), with similar trends for C-reactive protein. Similar correlations were seen for SDAI, clinical disease activity index, disease activity score 28 at 1 year with x-ray change during that year (r=0.26–0.28, p=0.002–0.006).
