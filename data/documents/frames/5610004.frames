Training cohort	Validation cohort	C-index in the NSCLC group	1509	1618	The C-index was higher for the NSCLC cohort nomogram than for the TNM staging system (0.67 vs. 0.64, P = 0.01
Training cohort	Validation cohort	C-index in the NSCLC group	20248	20705	The C-index of our nomogram for predicting OS was higher in the primary cohort (0.67; 95%CI, 0.65-0.69), compared to the C-index values obtained from the TNM staging system in the NSCLC cohort (0.64; 95%CI, 0.62-0.66; P = 0.01). The C-index of our nomogram (0.60; 95%CI, 0.55-0.65) was superior to clinical stage, limited / extensive stage, and diagnosis (0.53; 95%CI, 0.47-0.59) for the SCLC cohort, although this was not significantly different (P =0.12).
