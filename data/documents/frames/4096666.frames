Propofol 	Thiopental	Septal mitral annular velocity during systole after 5 minutes	1417	1570	Among TDI two parameters demonstrated a significant inter-group difference: the S' in propofol was lower than that in Thiopental-group at T3 (p = 0.002),
Propofol 	Thiopental	Septal mitral annular velocity during systole after 3 minutes	1417	1743	Among TDI two parameters demonstrated a significant inter-group difference: the S' in propofol was lower than that in Thiopental-group at T3 (p = 0.002), and a' velocities were persistently lower in Propofol-group, compared with same time values in Thiopental-group (T1, T2, and T3: p = 0.025, 0.007, and 0.009, respectively).
Propofol 	Thiopental	Bispectral index	13626	13957	In BIS, the baseline value was similar between the two (p = 0.553), so as the first drop at T1 (p = 0.069), however, after that thiopental group showed more recovered and higher level of BIS compared with those of propofol [T2: 57.5 (52.0-64.8) vs. 44.0 (37.5-50.8), p = 0.009; T3: 63.5 (62.0-66.5) vs. 45.0 (41.3-52.0), p < 0.001]
Propofol 	Thiopental	Systolic blood pressure recovery	13969	14305	A related pattern was observed in systolic BP: the baseline and initial decline were similar between the two groups (p = 0.193 and 0.214); however, after that thiopental group tended to recover and significantly higher level of systolic BP compared with those of propofol [T2: 121.0 (111.3-136.8) vs. 106.5 (95.3-115.0) mmHg, p = 0.014;
