With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Bacteriuria	1394	1707	Catheterisation does not influence: the number of additional doses of ketoprofen and pethidine administered during the 1st day after the operation, the duration of hospitalization, the occurrence of fever, significant bacteriuria, the postoperative acute urinary retention and the post-void residual urine volume.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Hospital stay after surgery	7809	7955	There was also no significant difference in the post-operative hospital stay between the groups, both in total and separately in women and in men.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Fever	7956	8056	No fever occurred after surgery in any of the patients â€“ there were no differences among the groups.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Bacteriuria	8057	8162	Presence of the post-operative positive urine culture was not significantly dependent on catheterisation.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Acute urinary retention and post-void residual urine volume 	1394	1707	Catheterisation does not influence: the number of additional doses of ketoprofen and pethidine administered during the 1st day after the operation, the duration of hospitalization, the occurrence of fever, significant bacteriuria, the postoperative acute urinary retention and the post-void residual urine volume.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Pain intensity	6633	6747	It was confirmed that the catheterised patients had sensed more intensive pain than the non-catheterised subjects.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Pain intensity	1316	1393	Intensity of pain measured by the Visual Analog Scale was higher in Group II.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Acute urinary retention and post-void residual urine volume 	8163	8344	No significant correlation was found in the post operative AUR and PVR >30 ml on the day of discharge depending on catheterisation, both in total and separately in women and in men.
With catheter (group II)	Without catheter (group I)	Fever	1394	1707	Catheterisation does not influence: the number of additional doses of ketoprofen and pethidine administered during the 1st day after the operation, the duration of hospitalization, the occurrence of fever, significant bacteriuria, the postoperative acute urinary retention and the post-void residual urine volume.
