High insulin levels	Low insulin levels	Progression-free survival	-1	-1	Higher levels of Insulin (HR = 0.81, 95 % CI: 0.67–0.98; p = 0.03) and C-peptide (HR = 0.62, 95 % CI: 0.39–1.00; p = 0.05) were associated with longer PFS.
High hepatocyte growth factor levels	Low hepatocyte growth factor levels	Progression-free survival	1006	1350	In the univariable analysis, higher insulin (HR = 0.81 [0.67, 0.98] p = 0.03) and C-peptide (HR = 0.62 [0.39, 1.00]; p = 0.05) levels were associated with a longer PFS, while higher Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF; HR = 1.63 [1.06, 2.51] p = 0.03) and Osteopontin (OPN; HR = 1.56 [1.13, 2.15]; p = 0.01) levels were associated with a shorter PFS.
High hepatocyte growth factor levels	Low hepatocyte growth factor levels	Progression-free survival	1181	1350	higher Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF; HR = 1.63 [1.06, 2.51] p = 0.03) and Osteopontin (OPN; HR = 1.56 [1.13, 2.15]; p = 0.01) levels were associated with a shorter PFS.
