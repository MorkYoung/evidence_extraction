rinse their mouths with 0.2% chlorhexidine for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks	rinse their mouths with triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks 	periodontal disease	1015	1168	There was no significant difference when the efficacy of triphala was compared with 0.2% chlorhexidine in hospitalized patients with periodontal disease.
rinse their mouths with 0.2% chlorhexidine or triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks	rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks 	The plaque index (PI) and the gingival index (GI)	21034	21157	Triphala as a mouthwash showed significant reduction in periodontal indices when compared to scaling and root planing alone
rinse their mouths with 0.2% chlorhexidine or triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks	rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks 	The plaque index (PI) and the gingival index (GI)	701	895	Patients in group A were advised to rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water, group B with 0.2% chlorhexidine, and group C with triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks.
rinse their mouths with 0.2% chlorhexidine or triphala mouthwash for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks	rinse their mouths with 10 mL of distilled water for 1 minute twice daily for two weeks 	The plaque index (PI) and the gingival index (GI)	11946	12246	The intergroup comparison of the mean differences in the PI and GI calculated using ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between group B and group C, but when group B and group C were compared with group A, there was a statistically significant difference (P<0.05) (Table 1) (Fig. 2).
