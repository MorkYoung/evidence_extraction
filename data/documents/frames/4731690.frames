proximal extensive HAS	distal extensive HAS	6-month outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS])	706	1025	HAS presence (vs absence) independently predicted poor 6-month outcome (increased Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS]) on adjusted ordinal regression analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, p < 0.001). Outcome was worse in patients with more (vs less) extensive HAS (OR 0.61, p = 0.027) but not in proximal (vs distal) HAS (p = 0.420).
more extensive hyperdense artery sign (HAS)	less extensive hyperdense artery sign (HAS)	HAS shrinkage and alteplase effect	17250	17367	Nevertheless, there was no evidence of an interaction between HAS extent and alteplase effect (p = 0.580) (figure 2).
proximal extensive HAS	distal extensive HAS	HAS shrinkage and alteplase effect	1210	1374	There was no significant difference in HAS shrinkage with alteplase in proximal (vs distal) or more (vs less) extensive HAS (p = 0.516 and p = 0.580, respectively).
