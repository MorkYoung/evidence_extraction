PHiD-CV Phase III Clinical (Clin group)	PHiD-CV Commercial lot (Com group)	Reactogenicity and safety profiles	28442	28614	The reactogenicity and safety profiles of the Commercial and the Phase III Clinical lots of PHiD-CV were comparable and clinically acceptable, in line with previous studies
PHiD-CV Phase III Clinical (Clin group)	PHiD-CV Commercial lot (Com group)	Serious adverse events	1947	2051	No serious adverse events considered causally related to vaccination were reported throughout the study.
PHiD-CV Phase III Clinical (Clin group)	PHiD-CV Commercial lot (Com group)	Antigens of co-administered vaccines	-1	-1	Co-administered vaccine antigens<NEWLINE> <NEWLINE>One month post-primary and post-booster vaccination, all children were seroprotected against diphtheria, tetanus and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, and all infants were seropositive for antibodies against the three pertussis antigens and polyribosylribitol phosphate from Hib. All infants except one were seroprotected against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) at one month post-primary vaccination. Three children had anti-HBs antibody concentrations which were initially measured between 10 and 100 mIU/mL. Out of these 3 children, upon retesting using ImmuliteTM, one was found to be seroprotected while the other 2 had anti-HBs antibody concentrations <10 mIU/mL. This was further followed up by investigators and one child was subsequently re-vaccinated. Efforts to reach the other child for re-vaccination were unsuccessful. Three months after the second dose of the HRV vaccine, â‰¥81.9% of infants were seropositive for anti-HRV antibodies (data not shown).

All infants except one were seroprotected against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) at one month post-primary vaccination.
PHiD-CV Phase III Clinical (Clin group)	PHiD-CV Commercial lot (Com group)	Immune response	-1	-1	In the primary vaccination phase, immune responses induced by the PHiD-CV Commercial lot were shown to be non-inferior to those induced by the Phase III Clinical lot
