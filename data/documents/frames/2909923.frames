Creatine supplementation 	Control	Plasma glucose	1081	1234	Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation.
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Muscle creatine phosphate	21246	21339	muscle CP was higher following supplementation in the creatine than placebo group (P < 0.05).
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Muscle glycogen	22845	23255	Muscle glycogen content (Figure 7b) was reduced (P < 0.05) by approximately 600 mmol/kg dry mass both before and after supplementation in creatine and placebo groups. After supplementation, muscle glycogen content at the end of the two-hour ride was higher in the creatine than placebo group (P < 0.05) due to the higher resting muscle glycogen content after supplementation in the creatine than placebo group.
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Muscle glycogen	23033	23147	, muscle glycogen content at the end of the two-hour ride was higher in the creatine than placebo group (P < 0.05)
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Respiratory exchange ratio 	1081	1234	Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation.
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Blood lactate	1081	1234	Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation.
Creatine supplementation 	Control	Muscle creatine phosphate	925	1079	There was a 24.5 ± 10.0% increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9% increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group (P < 0.05)
Creatine supplementation 	Control	VO2 peak	1081	1234	Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation.
