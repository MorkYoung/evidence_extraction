Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	sore throat 2 hours post–operation	1212	1550	Number of patients who developed sore throat was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group (75%) compared to Cisatracurium group (27.5%) at the time of entrance to the recovery room (P = 0.001). These numbers decreased at 2 hours post–operation (42% versus 17.5%) but the difference was still statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	developed fasciculation	12376	12543	97.5% of the patients who had received Succinylcholine developed fasciculation, while none of the patients in the Cisatraciruim arm showed similar problem (P < 0.001).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	At 12 and 24 hours post operation	10977	11066	. At 12 and 24 hours post operation, the difference was no longer significant (Figure 2).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	sore throat 2 hours post–operation	10790	10978	hese numbers decreased at 2 hours post–operation (42% in the Succinylcholine group and 17.5% in the Cisatracurium group) but the difference was still statistically significant (P = 0.027).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	At 12 and 24 hours post operation	11390	11514	At 12 and 24 hours post operation, the difference was no longer significant (P = 0.35 and P = 0.19 respectively) (Figure 3).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	At 12 and 24 hours post operation	11782	11891	The difference was no longer significant at 12 (P = 0.22) and 24 (P = 0.063) hours post-operation (Figure 4).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	At 12 and 24 hours post operation	10979	11066	At 12 and 24 hours post operation, the difference was no longer significant (Figure 2).
Succinylcholine group	Cisatracurium group	Muscle ache and fasciculation	12545	12688	Muscle ache and fasciculation was experienced in 85% of the patients in Succinylcholine group and 27.5% of the Cisatracurium group (P = 0.002).
