E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Urge to smoke	26550	26907	No statistically significant differences were found in the maximal smoking urge reduction parameters Emax0–30 and Emaxreduction0–30 (all differences within 11 %) or the overall smoking urge reduction parameter AUEC0-30 (all differences within 21 %) between the use of a single tobacco cigarette and each of the e-cigarettes during the controlled use period.
E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Nicotine concentration after ad lib use	33186	33356	Following ad lib use of all products for 60 min, the tobacco cigarette yielded a significantly higher nicotine concentration (C90) compared to each of the e-cigarettes. T
E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Baseline nicotine concentrations	-1	-1	Baseline nicotine concentrations were below the limit of quantification in the majority of subjects and mean baseline nicotine concentrations were comparable across study products, all representing less than half the limit of quantification of 0.200 ng/mL
E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Serious adverse events	28173	28264	There were no serious adverse events reported and no subjects were discontinued due to AEs.
E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Nicotine concentration after ad lib use	24951	25107	the nicotine concentration at the end of the ad lib use period was significantly higher following use of the tobacco cigarette compared to the e-cigarettes,

E-cigarettes 	Conventional tobacco cigarette	Urge to smoke	27271	27472	During the ad lib use period, the overall smoking urge reduction (AUEC30-90) achieved with use of the e-cigarettes were comparable to that of the tobacco cigarette, with all differences less than 10 %.
