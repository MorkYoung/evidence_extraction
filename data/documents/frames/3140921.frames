Mid-ramp extinction 	Short-ramp extinction	End-extinction gaze velocity	-1	-1	Differences between the MRE and the SRE conditions were also found; end-extinction gaze velocity was significantly greater in the MRE condition than in the SRE condition (F(1, 15) = 6.65, P < 0.05)
Mid-ramp extinction 	Short-ramp extinction	End-extinction gaze velocity	-1	-1	Differences between the MRE and the SRE conditions were also found; end-extinction gaze velocity was significantly greater in the MRE condition than in the SRE condition (F(1, 15) = 6.65, P < 0.05).Fig. 3
Mid-ramp extinction 	Short-ramp extinction	End-extinction head velocity	18511	18592	There was no effect of expectation (MRE vs. SRE) on end-extinction head velocity.
