Galvanic vestibular stimulation	Control	Error rate	-1	-1	The GVS group showed a reduction in error rate after GVS was applied, and the Sham group showed an increase in error rate after GVS was applied
Galvanic vestibular stimulation	Control	Error rate	-1	-1	Error rate showed statistically significant differences in interactions between the time of response and group (F=9.302, p<0.05). Reaction time showed no statistically significant differences in interactions between the time of response and group.). The GVS group showed a reduction in error rate after GVS was applied, and the Sham group showed an increase in error rate after GVS was applied.
