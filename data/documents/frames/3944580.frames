Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Acyl ghrelin	934	1031	A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect for leptin and acyl ghrelin.
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Acyl ghrelin	1142	1266	The data indicated that although acute treadmill exercise resulted in a significant change in acyl ghrelin and leptin levels
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Des-acyl ghrelin	1032	1140	However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05)
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Obestatin	1142	1333	The data indicated that although acute treadmill exercise resulted in a significant change in acyl ghrelin and leptin levels, it had no effect on plasma obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin levels.
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Des-acyl ghrelin	934	1141	A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction effect for leptin and acyl ghrelin. However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05).
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Obestatin	1032	1141	However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05).
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Obestatin	1032	1140	However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05)
Motor-driven treadmill exercise 	Control	Leptin	15025	15210	Two-factor ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (P < 0.05), a main effect of time (P < 0.05) and a trial and time interaction (P < 0.05) for acylated ghrelin and leptin concentrations.
