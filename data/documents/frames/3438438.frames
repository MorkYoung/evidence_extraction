program and jogging based on health belief model (HBM) on sugar control in type 2 diabetic patients	control	instructions for jogging	7388	7863	In addition, before training intervention, most of internal instructions of patients for jogging in the group of intervention and control respectively included feeling exhilaration during jogging (50% and 47%), fear of blood sugar increase (38% and 34%) and fear of catching side effects of diabetes (36% and 40%). But after training intervention, Chi Square test indicated a significant difference in all the internal instructions of diabetic patients for jogging (Table 3).
