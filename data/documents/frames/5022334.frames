Thyroidectomy via BABA	Conventional open thyroidectomy 	Visual analogue scale	1706	1871	The study showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of the VASs (2.1 ± 1.0 vs. 3.8 ± 1.2, P < 0.05) and NSS (8.9 ± 0.8 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7, P < 0.05).
Thyroidectomy via BABA	Conventional open thyroidectomy 	Complications	17628	17881	The complications in both groups, such as hypoparathyroidism (temporary), RLN paralysis (temporary), seroma, skin burn, flap necrosis, hematoma, wound infection, chyle leakage, and postoperative Tg levels, were not statistically different (all P > 0.05)
Thyroidectomy via BABA	Conventional open thyroidectomy 	Surgery time	1551	1705	he mean operative time of the robotic group was longer than that of the conventional open approach group (118.8 ± 16.5 min vs. 90.7 ± 10.3 min, P < 0.05).
