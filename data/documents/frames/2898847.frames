Terrestrial Trunked Radio Telecommunications System (TETRA)	controls	anxiety, tension, arousal, discomfort, and fatigue and relaxation	23767	24063	In the open provocation test, we found an overall difference for group (sensitive vs. control) for all six variables (p ≤ 0.008), indicating that sensitives experienced greater anxiety, tension, arousal, discomfort, and fatigue and less relaxation than controls, regardless of exposure condition.
Terrestrial Trunked Radio Telecommunications System (TETRA)	controls	total symptom score, total number of symptoms reported , symptom severity and number of symptoms	26732	27133	Under double-blind conditions, we found a significant difference between groups for the total symptom score (z = −4.917, p < 0.001) and total number of symptoms reported (z = −5.282, p < 0.001), with sensitives reporting greater symptom severity (mean ± SE = 5.23 ± 1.06, n = 48) and number of symptoms (4.03 ± 0.71, n = 48) compared with controls (1.20 ± 0.18 and 0.92 ± 0.10, respectively; n = 132).
Terrestrial Trunked Radio Telecommunications System (TETRA)	controls	anxiety, tension, arousal, discomfort, and fatigue and relaxation	24592	24822	. Analyses of difference scores (TETRA – sham) revealed that sensitive participants reported a significantly greater increase in levels of anxiety, tension, arousal, and discomfort during the TETRA exposure compared with controls.
