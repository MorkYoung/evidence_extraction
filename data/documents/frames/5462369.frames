Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine + primaquine 	Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine	Hemoglobin 	24158	24302	Among these 8 subjects, a greater drop in hemoglobin at day 7 was seen among those treated with primaquine but was not statistically significant
Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine + primaquine 	Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine	Hemoglobin 	24304	24494	median fractional reduction in hemoglobin was 24.8% (range 0.9% to 29.8%) in the six subjects given primaquine vs. 7.1% (-4.4% and 18.7%) in the two subjects not given primaquine (p = 0.14).
Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine + primaquine 	Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine	Rate of gametocyte carriage	20732	21017	By one week post follow-up, 5 days after primaquine dosing, those given primaquine had a lower rate of gametocyte carriage, with 2.1% of subjects in the DHP + PQ group displaying patent gametocytes vs. 15% of those in the DHP-only arm (prevalence ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.02–0.9, p = 0.03)
Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine + primaquine 	Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine	Rate of gametocyte carriage	20792	21019	those given primaquine had a lower rate of gametocyte carriage, with 2.1% of subjects in the DHP + PQ group displaying patent gametocytes vs. 15% of those in the DHP-only arm (prevalence ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.02–0.9, p = 0.03) (
Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine + primaquine 	Dihydroartemisin-piperaquine	Time to clearance	22070	22225	the median time to clearance was 1 day in the primaquine group vs. 12 days in the non-primaquine group (hazard ratio 7.3 (95% CI 1.3–42), logrank p = 0.01)
