Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Tumor size before or after surgery	1038	1219	Before surgery and the outcome of primary end point after surgery, no significant differences were observed for clinical data and tumor size between the AG and CG groups (P > 0.05).
Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Lipid profile improvement after 8 months	17620	17848	In AG, serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, and MDA were reduced, whereas the serum level of HDL-C was increased after 8 months; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P > 0.05, Table 2).
Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Tumor volume after 2 years of therapy	1220	1332	After 2-year therapy, the mean tumor volume was 214.6 ± 145.7 c.c. in AG and 467.2 ± 225.3 c.c in CG (P < 0.01).
Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Lipid profile improvement after 8 months	17620	17847	In AG, serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, and MDA were reduced, whereas the serum level of HDL-C was increased after 8 months; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P > 0.05, Table 2)
Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Lipid profile improvement after 16 months and 24 months	17849	18181	Lipid pattern was improved further in AG after 16 months, and statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P < 0.05, Table 2). Similarly, the lipid pattern was improved significantly in AG after 24 months, and statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P < 0.05; Table 2).
Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS; AG group)	Placebo (CG group)	Rate of local recurrence	1333	1419	The rate of local recurrence was 44.9 and 68.7% in AG and CG, respectively (P < 0.01).
