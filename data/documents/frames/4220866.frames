lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) - based regimens	nelfinavir (NVP)-based regimens	virologic failure (VF)	1014	1234	BL characteristics were comparable. In the ITT analysis, previous results showed no difference between LPV/r and NVP treatment arms at W96 except a higher proportion of virologic failure (VF) in p. on NVP-based regimens.
