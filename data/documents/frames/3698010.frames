Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Fever ≥39°C	1785	2046	Fever >39°C was rare during the infant series, such that there were too few cases for assessment. After the toddler dose, paracetamol effectively reduced fever >39°C, reaching statistical significance in the PP population only (efficacy 79%; 95% CI: 3.9, 97.7).
Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Fever ≥38°C	1421	1784	In the intent-to-treat population, paracetamol reduced the incidence of fever ≥38°C, but this reduction was only significant for the infant series, with computed efficacy of 43.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.4, 61.2), and not significant after the toddler dose (efficacy 15.9%; 95% CI: −19.9, 41.3); results were similar in the per protocol (PP) population.
Paracetamol 125 mg	Control	Vaccine-related serious adverse events	2162	2218	No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.
Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Activity	18300	18450	After the toddler dose, where systemic reactions occurred more often, only "activity" was significantly decreased in the prophylaxis group (p = 0.005)

Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Fever ≥38°C	1421	1725	In the intent-to-treat population, paracetamol reduced the incidence of fever ≥38°C, but this reduction was only significant for the infant series, with computed efficacy of 43.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.4, 61.2), and not significant after the toddler dose (efficacy 15.9%; 95% CI: −19.9, 41.3)
Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Activity	18013	18461	Systemic reactions were generally less frequent in the prophylaxis group with significant differences noted for fever, rash, irritability, drowsiness, decreased appetite, persistent inconsolable crying, and decreased activity after at least one dose in the infant series (all p < 0.05). After the toddler dose, where systemic reactions occurred more often, only "activity" was significantly decreased in the prophylaxis group (p = 0.005) (Table 4).
Paracetamol 250 mg	Control	Fever ≥39°C	1883	2046	After the toddler dose, paracetamol effectively reduced fever >39°C, reaching statistical significance in the PP population only (efficacy 79%; 95% CI: 3.9, 97.7).
