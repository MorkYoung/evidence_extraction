children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy	children whose mothers did not consume alcohol during pregnancy	'Conceptual Thinking', 'Face recognition', 'Story completion', and reasoning tests-'Rover', 'Block counting', and 'Pattern Reasoning'	19253	19455	No statistical association was found for visual abilities-'Conceptual Thinking', 'Face recognition', 'Story completion', and reasoning tests-'Rover', 'Block counting', and 'Pattern Reasoning' (Table 4).
children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy	children whose mothers did not consume alcohol during pregnancy	'Atlantis' and 'Number recall', and spatial ability tests-'Triangle', problem solving CCT-1 test	1039	1546	Children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy performed significantly poorly for memory and spatial abilities tests from small effect size difference for 'Atlantis' (0.27) and 'Triangle' (0.29) to moderate effect size difference for 'Number recall' (0.72) compared to children whose mothers did not consume alcohol during pregnancy; the exposed children scored significantly higher errors with a small effect size (0.37) at problem solving (CCT-1) test compared to unexposed children.
