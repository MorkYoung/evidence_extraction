FUFOX	CAPOX	Overall survival	14099	14217	Evaluating the different treatment arms separately, we found comparable survival times without significant differences
FUFOX	CAPOX	Progression-free survival in patients with codon 13 mutations	16244	16533	Interestingly, we found a substantial difference in PFS between patients with codon 12 and 13 mutant tumors when looking at infusional 5-FU versus capecitabine based regimens. Patients with codon 13 mutations seem to benefit more in terms of PFS from the oral capecitabine based protocols.
