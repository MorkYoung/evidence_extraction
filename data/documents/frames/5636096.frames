No improvement in PHES or CRT index was observed in the placebo group (-9.0±3.6 to -7.6±4.2, p = 0.22 and 1.7±0.5 to 1.8±0.5, p = 0.87).

There was no difference in exit PHES between the active and placebo group (-5.0 vs. -5.5, p = 0.40) but the mean PHES change was larger in the active group (3.9±0.9 vs. -0.8±0.8, p = 0.02).

anti-HE intervention (lactulose+branched-chain amino acids+rifaximin)	triple placebos	Post hoc analysis of psychometric effects according to entry PSE	25193	25816	Post hoc analysis of psychometric effects according to entry PSE: The patients were primarily stratified according to their CRT index, so the analysis according to PSE is an exploratory secondary analysis. It is based on 25 patients with an abnormal entry PSE, 13 of them receiving the active intervention and 12 of them receiving the placebos. Those on the active intervention improved their CRT index from 1.6±0.4 to 2.2±0.5 (p = 0.02) and PHES from -8.9±3.2 to -5.0±4.4 (p = 0.0014). No improvement in PHES or CRT index was observed in the placebo group (-9.0±3.6 to -7.6±4.2, p = 0.22 and 1.7±0.5 to 1.8±0.5, p = 0.87).
