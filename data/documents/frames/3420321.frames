β-alanine (n = 7; 6.4 g·d-1 over 4 weeks)	placebo	IKET hold-time	14828	15065	IKET hold times, pre- and post-supplementation are shown in Table 2. The 9.7 ± 9.4 s gain (+13.2%) in the β-alanine group was significantly higher (t(11) = 2.9, p < 0.05) than the corresponding change in the placebo group (−2.6 ± 4.3 s).
β-alanine (n = 7; 6.4 g·d-1 over 4 weeks)	placebo	maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)	1227	1291	There were no significant changes in MVIC force in either group.
β-alanine (n = 7; 6.4 g·d-1 over 4 weeks)	placebo	Impulse values	16588	16821	Impulse values pre- and post-supplementation are shown in Table 3. The 3.7 ± 1.3 kN·s-1 gain (+13.9%) in the β-alanine group was significantly different (t = (11) 3.1, p < 0.05) to the change in the placebo group (−1.1 ± 1.5 kN·s-1).
β-alanine (n = 7; 6.4 g·d-1 over 4 weeks)	placebo	IKET hold-time	967	1224	IKET hold-time increased by 9.7 ± 9.4 s (13.2%) and impulse by 3.7 ± 1.3 kN·s-1 (13.9%) following β-alanine supplementation. These changes were significantly greater than those in the placebo group (IKET: t(11) = 2.9, p ≤0.05; impulse: t(11) = 3.1, p ≤ 0.05
