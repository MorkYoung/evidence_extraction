Intensive aerobic exercise	Control	Forced expiratory volume 1 improvement	-1	-1	There were significant differences after intervention in FVC (z=−2.062, p=0.046), FEV1 (z=−2.082, p=0.037), and 6MWT (z=−2.246, p=0.025) between the two groups.
Intensive aerobic exercise	Control	Oxygen saturation 	-1	-1	There was no significant difference after intervention in the SpO2 (z=−0.082, p=0.935) and 10MWT (z= −0.514, p=0.078).
Intensive aerobic exercise	Control	6-minute walking test improvement 	-1	-1	There were significant differences after intervention in FVC (z=−2.062, p=0.046), FEV1 (z=−2.082, p=0.037), and 6MWT (z=−2.246, p=0.025) between the two groups.
Intensive aerobic exercise	Control	Forced expiratory volume 1 improvement	971	1199	The comparison of the two groups after the intervention revealed that the <NEWLINE>experimental group showed more significant improvements in the forced vital capacity, <NEWLINE>forced expiratory volume in one second, and six-minute walking test.
Intensive aerobic exercise	Control	Forced vital capacity improvement	971	1199	The comparison of the two groups after the intervention revealed that the <NEWLINE>experimental group showed more significant improvements in the forced vital capacity, <NEWLINE>forced expiratory volume in one second, and six-minute walking test.
