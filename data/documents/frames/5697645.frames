Evogliptin	Placebo	Hypoglycaemia	1229	1323	The overall incidence of adverse events, including hypoglycaemia, was similar in the 2 groups.
Evogliptin	Placebo	Glycated hemoglobin reduction	922	1059	At week 24, evogliptin significantly reduced HbA1c levels from baseline compared with placebo (−0.23% vs 0.05%, respectively,  <NEWLINE>P < .0001)
Evogliptin	Placebo	Glucagon-like peptide-1	15015	15203	The effects of evogliptin on fasting C‐peptide, insulin, proinsulin, GLP‐1, GIP, HOMA‐IR, QUICKI, proinsulin/insulin ratio, or insulinogenic index were not different from those of placebo.
Evogliptin	Placebo	Insulin levels	15015	15203	The effects of evogliptin on fasting C‐peptide, insulin, proinsulin, GLP‐1, GIP, HOMA‐IR, QUICKI, proinsulin/insulin ratio, or insulinogenic index were not different from those of placebo.
Evogliptin	Placebo	Improvement in HOMA�β index	14846	15014	A numerically greater improvement was observed in the HOMA‐β index with evogliptin after 24 weeks compared with placebo (4.51 vs −5.41, respectively, nominal P = .030).
Evogliptin	Placebo	Reaching Glycated hemoglobin <6.5%	1061	1227	Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <6.5% was significantly higher in the evogliptin group than in the placebo group (33.3% vs 15.2%;  <NEWLINE>P <NEWLINE> = .008)
Evogliptin	Placebo	Improvement in HOMA�β index	14846	15013	A numerically greater improvement was observed in the HOMA‐β index with evogliptin after 24 weeks compared with placebo (4.51 vs −5.41, respectively, nominal P = .030)
Evogliptin	Placebo	Glycated hemoglobin reduction	934	1059	evogliptin significantly reduced HbA1c levels from baseline compared with placebo (−0.23% vs 0.05%, respectively,  <NEWLINE>P < .0001)
