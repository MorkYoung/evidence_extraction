AirtraqTM	Macintosh, McCoyTM	Cormack-Lehane glottic view	11328	11538	A significantly better Cormack and Lehane glottic view was obtained at laryngoscopy with less optimisation maneuvers in the AirtraqTM group (P < 0.01) compared with the Macintosh and McCoyTM laryngoscope group.
Macintosh	AirtraqTM, McCoyTM	heart rate and mean arterial blood pressures	11935	12172	Tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope resulted in significant increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressures, compared to preintubation values in contrast to AirtraqTM and McCoyTM laryngoscope group [Figures 1 and 2].
Macintosh	AirtraqTM, McCoyTM	heart rate and mean arterial blood pressures	11935	12153	Tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope resulted in significant increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressures, compared to preintubation values in contrast to AirtraqTM and McCoyTM laryngoscope group
AirtraqTM	Macintosh, McCoyTM	Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score	1266	1463	The AirtraqTM laryngoscope significantly reduced the IDS (mean − 0.43 ± 0.81) as compared with both McCoyTM (mean − 1.63 ± 1.49, P = 0.001) and Macintosh laryngoscope (mean −2.23 ± 1.92, P < 0.001)
AirtraqTM	Macintosh, McCoyTM	Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score	10859	11103	The IDS scores [Table 3] were significantly lower in patients intubated with the AirtraqTM (mean 0.43 ± 0.81) than those intubated with either the Macintosh (mean 2.23 ± 1.92, P < 0.001) or the McCoyTM (mean 1.6 ± 1.49, P = 0.001) laryngoscope.
