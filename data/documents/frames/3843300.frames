N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg)	control group	creatinine (Cr)	12619	12936	The serum levels of BUN and Cr in the control group increased significantly when compared with the sham group (P < 0.05). Administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN in comparison with the control group. However, only the serum level of Cr decreased significantly (P < 0.05) [Figure 1].
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg)	control group	creatinine (Cr)	12741	12936	Administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN in comparison with the control group. However, only the serum level of Cr decreased significantly (P < 0.05) [Figure 1].
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg)	control group	the lung injury score	1186	1347	NAC did not improve kidney weight and damage; however, its low dose (150 mg/kg) attenuated the lung injury score (P < 0.05) when compared with the control group.
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg)	control group	serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 	912	1185	The serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) in the control group increased significantly (P < 0.05), and administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN. However, only the serum level of Cr decreased significantly (P < 0.05).
sham-operated group	control	serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr)	12619	12739	The serum levels of BUN and Cr in the control group increased significantly when compared with the sham group (P < 0.05)
sham-operated group	control	serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr)	912	1113	The serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) in the control group increased significantly (P < 0.05), and administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN.
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (150 mg/kg)	control group	serum level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 	12741	12936	Administration of NAC (150 mg/kg) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN in comparison with the control group. However, only the serum level of Cr decreased significantly (P < 0.05) [Figure 1].
