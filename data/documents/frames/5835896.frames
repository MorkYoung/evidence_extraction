patients with HLA-A*2402 	patients without HLA-A*2402 	overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) - stage IIIb	13514	13619	There was no significant difference in OS between HLA-A*2402 matched and unmatched stage IIIb CRC groups.
patients with HLA-A*2402 	patients without HLA-A*2402 	The 3-year elapse-free survival (RFS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) - stage IIIb	13260	13503	The 3-year RFS in HLA-A*2402 matched and unmatched stage IIIb CRC groups was 46.1 and 0%, respectively (HR=0.293, 95% CI: 0.070–1.45, P=0.0789), with the HLA-A*2402 matched stage IIIb group showing a nonsignificant trend toward better survival
patients with HLA-A*2402	patients without HLA-A*2402	relapse-free survival (RFS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)	1262	1463	Three-year RFS was not significantly different between HLA-A*2402 matched and unmatched groups [67.8 vs. 73.6%, respectively; hazard ratio (HR)=1.254, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48–4.63; P=0.706].
patients with HLA-A*2402 with positive CTL response	patients with HLA-A*2402 without positive CTL response	The 3-year elapse-free survival (RFS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)	1464	1673	Three-year RFS was significantly better in patients with positive CTL responses in the HLA-A*2402 matched group compared with those without (85.7 and 33.3%, respectively; HR=0.159, 95% CI: 0.023–0.697; P=0.011
patients with HLA-A*2402	patients without HLA-A*2402	Number of patients - stage IIIb in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)	11987	12142	Fewer patients with stage IIIb were in the HLA-A*2402 unmatched group than the HLA-A*2402 matched group, but this difference was not significant (P=0.059).
patients with HLA-A*2402 with positive CTL response	patients with HLA-A*2402 without positive CTL response	The 3-year elapse-free survival (RFS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)	14807	15011	The 3-year RFS was significantly better in patients with positive CTL responses than in those without in the HLA-A*2402 matched group (85.7 vs. 33.3%, respectively, HR=0.159, 95% CI: 0.023–0.697, P=0.011)
