Vitamin D	control	expression profile of miRNA in plasma	8882	9326	In the first pilot 136 miRNAs were detected by RT-qPCR in one or more of the samples, and 11 miRNAs showed a significant difference in mean expression value between baseline and 12 months (P < 0.05, student's t-test) (Table 2). In the second pilot 113 miRNAs were detected in one or more of the samples. Eighteen of these miRNAs showed a significant difference in mean expression value between baseline and after 12 months (P < 0.05) (Table 3).
