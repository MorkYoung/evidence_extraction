ASH group	SLA, SHA, SHSH, and placebo groups,	The GMTs	-1	-1	The GMTs were significantly higher (P < .0001, by the Kruskal-Wallis test) in the ASH group after the SeV boost than in the other groups (53, 53, 245, 50, and 59 in the SLA, SHA, ASH, SHSH, and placebo groups, respectively; Figure 4).
groups primed with SeV-Gag and boosted with Ad35-GRIN (SLA and SHA)	a single dose of Ad35-GRIN or SeV-Gag	Gag-specific IFN-? enzyme-linked immunospot–determined response rates and geometric mean responses	1307	1762	Gag-specific IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot–determined response rates and geometric mean responses were higher (96% and 248 spot-forming units, respectively) in groups primed with SeV-Gag and boosted with Ad35-GRIN (SLA and SHA) than those after a single dose of Ad35-GRIN (56% and 54 spot-forming units, respectively) or SeV-Gag (55% and 59 spot-forming units, respectively); responses persisted for ≥8 months after completion of the prime-boost regimen.
SLA and SHA groups	ASH group	the Gag response rate	-1	-1	In the SLA and SHA groups combined, the Gag response rate was significantly higher 2 weeks after the second vaccination (95.7%), compared with the rate in the ASH group 2 weeks after either the Ad35-GRIN prime or the SeV-Gag boost (54.5% for both; P = .008).
groups primed with SeV-Gag and boosted with Ad35-GRIN (SLA and SHA)	a single dose of Ad35-GRIN or SeV-Gag	Functional CD8+ T-cell responses with greater breadth, magnitude, and frequency in a viral inhibition assay	1763	1989	Functional CD8+ T-cell responses with greater breadth, magnitude, and frequency in a viral inhibition assay were also seen in the SLA and SHA groups after Ad35-GRIN boost, compared with those who received either vaccine alone.
