PM01183	topotecan	median PFS (Progression-free survival)	12469	12626	median PFS was significantly longer with PM01183: 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.5–5.7 months) versus 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.4–2.8 months) with topotecan (P = 0.0067).
PM01183	topotecan	median PFS (Progression-free survival)	-1	-1	Median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.7–5.6 months) (Figure 2A). Median OS was 10.6 months (95% CI, 9.5–18.1 months). Table 2
PM01183	topotecan	Median OS	12627	12761	Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.7–19.3 months) with PM01183, and 8.5 months (95% CI, 3.3–15.6 months) with topotecan (P = 0.2871).
PM01183	topotecan	median PFS (Progression-free survival) for patients with platinum-resistant disease	13309	13518	Median PFS was significantly longer with PM01183 versus topotecan for patients with platinum-resistant disease, both in the study as a whole (P = 0.0017) and in the second stage alone (P = 0.0043) (Figure 2B).
PM01183	topotecan	median PFS (Progression-free survival)	12437	12626	In the second randomized stage, median PFS was significantly longer with PM01183: 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.5–5.7 months) versus 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.4–2.8 months) with topotecan (P = 0.0067).
