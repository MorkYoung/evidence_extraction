rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3	no treatment	increased number of leukocytes (>10 HPF)	7261	7364	all patients had an increased number of leukocytes (>10 HPF) in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS)
rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3	no treatment	progression of chronic prostatitis plus IBS toward chronic microbial prostate-vesiculitis (PV) or prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE) in infertile males	1642	1819	Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections
rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3	no treatment	bacteriological methods	8792	9069	Standard bacteriological methods were used to quantify and identify all organisms, in one aliquot from each sample (derived from EPS or semen) cultured aerobically and anaerobically after diluting the samples (1:2) in saline solution, according to previously published methods.
rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3	no treatment	positive sperm culture (with CFU > 105 mlâˆ’1)	13192	13814	Overall, the treatment with rifaximin and VSL#3 was beneficial in terms of lowering the frequency of bacteriospermia when it was started immediately after the initial germ eradication rather than 6 months later. Indeed, patients of group "6Tx/6-" had the lowest frequency of positive sperm culture compared with patients of group "6-/6Tx" who received the treatment during the last 6 months of observation. The highest frequency was found in patients who were not prescribed any treatment and conversely, the lowest frequency was found among patients of group "12Tx" who received the treatment for all 12 months (Table 2).
