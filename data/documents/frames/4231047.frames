Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	Focal radiation-induced liver injury at 12 weeks	25777	26053	However at 12 weeks after BT (and 4 weeks after cessation of study treatment), these between-group differences were not observed (in neither the per-protocol nor intention-to-treat analyses) for the minimal mean hepatic threshold dose and the proportion of patients with fRILI
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy	25294	25478	The minimal mean hepatic threshold dose at 6 weeks after BT (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment group than the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	Median overall survival after radiotherapy	29476	29675	Median overall survival from time of BT on was not different between the groups with 30.0 months (95%CI: 8.7–51.3) in the treatment group and 39.5 months (27.5–51.5) in the control group (p = 0.430).
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	EQ5D and distribution of ECOG performance status	29297	29475	EQ5D (as a descriptor of quality of life) and distribution of ECOG performance status were not significantly different at baseline (Table 2) or at any follow-up visit (Table S1).
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy	1328	1526	Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011).
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	Focal radiation-induced liver injury at 12 weeks	1527	1746	Qualitative evidence of fRILI by MRI at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were observed at the 12-week follow-up.
Pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid, and low-dose low molecular weight heparin.	No medication	EQ5D and distribution of ECOG performance status	29297	29463	EQ5D (as a descriptor of quality of life) and distribution of ECOG performance status were not significantly different at baseline (Table 2) or at any follow-up visit
