Clearfil SE Bond	Filtek Silorane System	adhesive failure was the most common fracture mode	13133	13221	In the Filtek Silorane System groups, adhesive failure was the most common fracture mode
Clearfil SE Bond	Filtek Silorane System	adhesive failure was the most common fracture mode	13133	13327	In the Filtek Silorane System groups, adhesive failure was the most common fracture mode. In the Clearfil SE Bond groups, however, mixed and cohesive failures were the most common fracture modes
Clearfil SE Bond	Filtek Silorane System	degree of conversion (DC %)	10882	10979	The DC% of Clearfil SE Bond was significantly greater than the Filtek Silorane System (p= 0.001).
Clearfil SE Bond (0)	Filtek Silorane System	significant effect on bond strength	12840	12980	Clearfil SE Bond groups in-dicated that only Clearfil (0) experimental and control groups had significant effect on bond strength (p= 0.021)
Clearfil SE Bond with no Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)	Filtek Silorane System	storage time had significant effect on bond strength	1401	1543	The results of the t-test indicated that storage time only had significant effect on bond strength of Clearfil SE Bond with no EGCG (p= 0.017)
Clearfil SE Bond	Filtek Silorane System	mixed and cohesive failures were the most common fracture modes	13223	13327	In the Clearfil SE Bond groups, however, mixed and cohesive failures were the most common fracture modes
Clearfil SE Bond (0)	Filtek Silorane System	significant effect on bond strength	12815	13095	The results of t-test in Clearfil SE Bond groups in-dicated that only Clearfil (0) experimental and control groups had significant effect on bond strength (p= 0.021); whereas in Silorane groups, there were no significant differences between non-stored and stored groups (p> 0.05).
