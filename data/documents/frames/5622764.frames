Stomacol® tablets (1.53 g of β-glucan)	placebo (Plac)	maximal glucose value	11943	12120	There were no general improvements in favour of β-glucan over Plac. Instead, there was a significant increase in some basic measures of glycaemic control such as maximal glucose
Stomacol® tablets (1.53 g of β-glucan)	placebo (Plac)	maximal glucose value	576	948	There was an increase in basic measures of glycaemic control (maximal glucose value 341 ± 15 vs. 378 ± 13 mg/dL for Plac and β-glucan, p = 0.004), and average daily risk range (62 ± 5 vs. 79 ± 4 mg/dL for Plac and β-glucan, p = 0.003) favouring Plac over β-glucan, but no increase in the M-value (the weighted average of the glucose values) or other more complex measures.
