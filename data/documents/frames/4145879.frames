Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition	Control	Go processing-times	1334	1465	There was no significant change in go processing-times during or after transcranial direct-current stimulation in either condition.
Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition	Control	No-signal reaction time	1730	1858	However, there was no transcranial direct-current stimulation effect on the no-signal reaction time during the stop-signal task.
Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition	Control	Stop-signal processing times	1072	1333	Compared to the sham condition, there were significant reductions in the stop-signal processing times during and after transcranial direct-current stimulation, and change times were significantly greater in the transcranial direct-current stimulation condition.
Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition	Control	Stop-signal processing times	7058	7360	Univariate analysis showed a large main effect of condition (P < 0.05), test phase (P < 0.05), and condition-by-test interaction (P < 0.05) for the stop-signal reaction time, suggesting it was significantly reduced in the transcranial direct-current stimulation condition compared to the sham condition
Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition	Control	Change times	1072	1333	Compared to the sham condition, there were significant reductions in the stop-signal processing times during and after transcranial direct-current stimulation, and change times were significantly greater in the transcranial direct-current stimulation condition.
