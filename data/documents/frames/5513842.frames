paravertebral block (PVB)	control	first analgesic request time	18468	18661	In the current study, first analgesic request time were significantly higher in the PVB group at 120 minutes (60–120) than in the control group at 30 minutes (27.5–30), P-value <0.05 (Table 4).
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	The total tramadol consumption	18250	18409	The total tramadol consumption was significantly lower in the PVB group 200 mg (150.00–250) than the control 300 mg (200–350), with P-value of 0.003 (Table 4).
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores	17605	17822	The pain intensity at rest and while coughing (movement) reported with the NRS score was significantly lower in the paravertebral group as compared with the control group for each time point (P<0.05) (Tables 2 and 3).
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	The total tramadol consumption	1621	1763	cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150–250) mg vs 300 (200–350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (P=0.003)
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	nurse-administered morphine	18039	18249	The median (25th–75th percentiles) cumulative morphine consumption, including nurse-administered morphine, in the paravertebral group was 0 mg (0–2) and 2.5 mg (2–4) in the control group, with P-value of 0.001.
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	postoperative mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation	17255	17431	There were no significant differences concerning postoperative mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation values between groups (P>0.05).
paravertebral block (PVB)	control	first analgesic request time	1780	1926	the median (25th–75th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically significant fashion (P<0.0001).
