Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Insulin	1231	1280	Short-term E2 reduced postprandial TG and insulin
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Insulin	18346	18490	Compared with placebo, 2 weeks of E2 increased serum leptin (Table 1), reduced postprandial TG and insulin responses (Figures 2B and 3D; p<0.05)
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Postprandial triglycerides	1231	1422	Short-term E2 reduced postprandial TG and insulin, but had no effect on oxidation or storage of dietary FA. E2 increased the proportion of small adipocytes in femoral (but not abdominal) SAT.
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Postprandial triglycerides	1231	1280	Short-term E2 reduced postprandial TG and insulin
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Postprandial triglycerides	958	1136	Compared to premenopausal, healthy lean postmenopausal women had increased postprandial glucose and insulin and trend for higher TG, but similar dietary FA oxidation and storage.
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Serum leptin	18346	18405	Compared with placebo, 2 weeks of E2 increased serum leptin
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Serum leptin	18346	18491	Compared with placebo, 2 weeks of E2 increased serum leptin (Table 1), reduced postprandial TG and insulin responses (Figures 2B and 3D; p<0.05),
Short-term estradiol (E2)	Placebo	Storage of dietary fatty acids (FA)	1231	1338	Short-term E2 reduced postprandial TG and insulin, but had no effect on oxidation or storage of dietary FA.
