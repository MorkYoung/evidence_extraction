fatal CVD events	nonfatal CVD	IL-6	16166	16429	while thirds of IL-6 showed little discriminative ability in separating risk for nonfatal CVD in unadjusted models (p = 0.13), associations with risk for fatal CVD events, fatal other CV events, or non-CVD mortality were all highly significant (p≤0.0002 for all).
fatal other CV events	nonfatal CVD	IL-6	16135	16429	These curves clearly show that while thirds of IL-6 showed little discriminative ability in separating risk for nonfatal CVD in unadjusted models (p = 0.13), associations with risk for fatal CVD events, fatal other CV events, or non-CVD mortality were all highly significant (p≤0.0002 for all).
fatal other CV events	nonfatal CVD	IL-6	16166	16429	while thirds of IL-6 showed little discriminative ability in separating risk for nonfatal CVD in unadjusted models (p = 0.13), associations with risk for fatal CVD events, fatal other CV events, or non-CVD mortality were all highly significant (p≤0.0002 for all).
fatal other CV events	nonfatal CVD	IL-6	16864	17263	As can be seen clearly, the HR for association of elevation in IL-6 with risk for nonfatal CVD of 1.06 (95% CI 0.94–1.20) was weaker than each of the mortality endpoints, as the upper confidence limits were less than the lower confidence limits of each of the mortality endpoints: HR 1.58 (1.28–1.94) for fatal CVD, 2.02 (1.28–3.18) for fatal other CV events, and 1.47 (1.24–1.74) for non-CVD death.
non-CVD mortality	nonfatal CVD	IL-6	16166	16429	while thirds of IL-6 showed little discriminative ability in separating risk for nonfatal CVD in unadjusted models (p = 0.13), associations with risk for fatal CVD events, fatal other CV events, or non-CVD mortality were all highly significant (p≤0.0002 for all).
