150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	baseline	maximum carbon dioxide production	1677	1793	the maximum carbon dioxide production increased under SB by ~4.8% (from ~3604 mL∙min-1 to ~3776 mL∙min-1, p = 0.049)
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	baseline	maximum carbon dioxide production	1664	1794	Furthermore, the maximum carbon dioxide production increased under SB by ~4.8% (from ~3604 mL∙min-1 to ~3776 mL∙min-1, p = 0.049).
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	placebo	The overall Fight Gone Bad (FGB)	1139	1275	The overall FGB performance improved under SB by ~6.1% (p<0.001) and it was ~3.1% higher compared to post placebo (PLApost) (p = 0.040).
150 mg∙kg-1 of Sodium bicarbonate (SB) for 10 days	placebo	gastrointestinal (GI) side effects	1059	1137	No gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were reported during the entire protocol
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	placebo	Pyruvate concentration and creatine kinase activity before incremental cycling (ICT)	28034	28386	Before the onset of ICT, pre exercise [Pa] increased from 0.25 ± 0.06 mmol∙L-1 SBpre to 0.32 ± 0.11 mmol∙L-1 SBpost (p = 0.001) and was significantly higher compared to that after placebo treatment (0.32 ± 0.11 mmol∙L-1 SBpost vs. 0.26 ± 0.09 mmol∙L-1 PLApost). Furthermore, CK activity before the onset of ICT decreased after both trials (SB and PLA).
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	placebo	The overall Fight Gone Bad (FGB)	1139	1274	The overall FGB performance improved under SB by ~6.1% (p<0.001) and it was ~3.1% higher compared to post placebo (PLApost) (p = 0.040)
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	placebo	Pyruvate concentration and creatine kinase activity before incremental cycling (ICT)	1795	1991	Pyruvate concentration and creatine kinase activity before ICT showed higher SBpost than PLApost (~0.32 mmol∙L-1 vs. ~0.26 mmol∙L-1, p = 0.001; ~275 U∙L-1 vs. ~250 U∙L-1, p = 0.010, respectively).
150 mg∙kg-1 of SB for 10 days	placebo	time to ventilatory threshold (VT), workload at VT and heart rate at VT in incremental cycling (ICT)	1387	1663	Moreover, in ICT, the time to ventilatory threshold (VT) (~8:25 min SBpost vs. ~8:00 min PLApost, p = 0.020), workload at VT (~218 W SBpost vs. ~208 W PLApost, p = 0.037) and heart rate at VT (~165 bpm SBpost vs. ~161 bpm PLApost, p = 0.030) showed higher SBpost than PLApost.
