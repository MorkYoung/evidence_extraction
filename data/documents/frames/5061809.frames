Free-walking	Rectangular-walking or Free-generation or Random-experienced 	originality	19928	20131	Participants in the free-walking group performed better than the rectangular-walking group (p < 0.001), the free-generation group (p < 0.001), and the random-experienced group (p < 0.001) in originality.
Free-walking	Rectangular-walking	fluency, flexibility, originality in patients over 65 years old	30117	30778	Scores on the three components of creativity were treated as three dependent measures, and a MANOVA was conducted with the groups (free-walking group and rectangular-walking group) as a between-subject factor. The results showed a significant effect of groups among three components, F(1,30) = 16.77, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.36 for fluency, F(1,30) = 12.74, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.30 for flexibility, F(1,30) = 15.74, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.34 for originality. Compared with the rectangular-walking group, the free-walking participants showed better divergent thinking with a large effect size (rs = 0.59, 0.53, 0.57 for fluency, flexibility, and originality, respectively).
