Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)	Insulin alone	Glucose AUC 0–3 h	6588	6718	The AUC0–3 h for glucose was reduced by 60, 58 and 72% for the 6, 9 and 12 mcg/U ratios (Table 1; all doses vs placebo: p < 0.001)
Insulin + Pramlintide (6 mcg/U)	Insulin + Pramlintide (12 mcg/U)	Elevation of glucose and glucagon after 1 hour	6242	6459	Compared with placebo/insulin, all three pramlintide/insulin ratios produced marked and statistically equivalent reductions of increments of glucose and glucagon in the first hour, with levels subsequently increasing.
Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)	Insulin alone	Hypoglycemia after 24 hours	870	896	No hypoglycaemia occurred.
Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)	Insulin alone	Glucagon AUC 0–3 h	6720	6844	Reductions of AUC0–3 h for glucagon for the 6, 9 and 12 mcg/U were 57, 59 and 55% (Table 1; all doses vs placebo: p < 0.05).
Insulin + Pramlintide (6 mcg/U)	Insulin + Pramlintide (12 mcg/U)	Elevation of glucose and glucagon after 1 hour	804	869	All ratios reduced 0–3‐h glucose and glucagon increments by >50%.
Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses)	Insulin alone	Hypoglycemia after 24 hours	6964	7058	No symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred during the 24‐h period after pramlintide administration.
