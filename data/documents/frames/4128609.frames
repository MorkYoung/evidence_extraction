Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	Baseline characteristics	15229	15313	There were no significant between-group differences in any baseline characteristics.
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	UPDRS total score	1547	1632	Based on the UPDRS II + III score, pramipexole ER was non-inferior to pramipexole IR.
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	Incidence of adverse events	1633	1691	The safety profiles of pramipexole ER and IR were similar.
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	UPDRS total score	841	1113	For the primary endpoint, the adjusted mean changes (standard error) of UPDRS Parts II + III at week 18 were -13.81 (0.655) and -13.05 (0.643) for ER and IR formulations, respectively, using ANCOVA adjusted for treatment and centre (fixed effect) and baseline (covariate).
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	Mean 'off'-time percentage during waking hours	17617	17889	The mean (SE) 'off'-time percentage during waking hours at baseline for advanced PD patients was 27.78 (0.81) for ER and 30.80 (1.21) for IR, and decreased to 21.68 (1.53) at week 18 for ER and 22.46 (1.61) for IR, respectively (no statistical difference for superiority).
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	Baseline characteristics	13134	13207	Demographics and baseline conditions were comparable between the two arms
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	Mean 'off'-time percentage during waking hours	18297	18541	No difference was observed in the mean 'off'-time percentage or duration between the two arms at any study visit (ANCOVA). Additionally, a similar response rate for 'off'-time was observed in the ER and IR arms after 18 weeks (52.7% vs. 55.7%).
Pramipexole extended-release	Pramipexole immediate-release	UPDRS total score	671	821	Non-inferiority was based on the primary endpoint, the change from baseline to end of maintenance (week 18) in the UPDRS (Parts II + III) total score.
