Islamic religious music	Classical music	Diastolic blood pressure 	15812	15946	An ANOVA test result on initial diastolic blood pressure between groups revealed no significant difference for any variables compared.
Islamic religious music	Control	Nor-adrenaline plasma level	1054	1596	There was a decrease in NAP level in the religious music group (0.110 ng/mL) and the control group (0.013 ng/mL) when initial NAP level was compared to post extraction NAP level, whilst the classical music group showed an increase of 0.053 ng/mL. There were significant differences found between the religious Islamic music group and the classical music group (p = 0.041) as well as the control group (p = 0.028) for the difference between pre and post NAP level, of which the NAP level of the religious Islamic group participants were lower.
Islamic religious music	Classical music	Systolic blood pressure 	15253	15810	A statistical analysis by using the ANOVA test on systolic blood pressure value revealed that there were no significant difference between each group on initial systolic blood pressure level (p=0.63), as well as post-extraction systolic blood pressure level (p=0.57). There was a significant difference found for systolic blood pressure between the classical music group and the religious Islamic music group (p = 0.037) as well as between religious Islamic group and control group (p = 0.023) for the difference between pre and post systolic blood pressure
