12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in waist-hip ratio	2322	2540	A physical activity intervention based on pedometer is an effective means to increase physical activity; reducing retention of weight gained during pregnancy and can improve anthropometric measures in postpartum women.
12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Weight reduction	21981	22084	ANCOVA revealed significant between-groups differences in anthropometric measures (p < 0.001 for weight
12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in body mass index	1917	2139	Significant differences between-group in weight (P = 0.001), Body Mass Index (P = 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.001), hip circumference (P = 0.032) and waist-hip ratio (P = 0.02) were presented after the intervention.
12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in waist circumference and hip circumference	1917	2139	Significant differences between-group in weight (P = 0.001), Body Mass Index (P = 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.001), hip circumference (P = 0.032) and waist-hip ratio (P = 0.02) were presented after the intervention.

12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in waist-hip ratio	-1	-1	The intervention group significantly decreased in weight (66.8 kg pre- and 64.7 kg post-intervention, p = 0.001), BMI (26.28 kg/m2 pre- and 25.47 kg/m2 post-intervention, p = 0.001), waist circumference (80.41 cm pre- and 76.76 cm post-intervention, p = 0.001), hip circumference (104.6 cm pre- and 101.5 cm post-intervention, p = 0.001) and WHR (0.76 pre- and 0.74 post-intervention, p = 0.001) over the study period. ANCOVA revealed significant between-groups differences in anthropometric measures (p < 0.001 for weight, BMI and waist circumference, p = 0.032 for hip circumference and p = 0.02 for WHR).
12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in physical activity and energy expenditure	1749	1916	After 12 weeks, women in the intervention group had significantly increased their physical activity and energy expenditure per week (4394 vs. 1651 calorie, p < 0.001).
12 week physical activity tailored program	Routine postpartum care	Improvement in body mass index	-1	-1	The intervention group significantly decreased in weight (66.8 kg pre- and 64.7 kg post-intervention, p = 0.001), BMI (26.28 kg/m2 pre- and 25.47 kg/m2 post-intervention, p = 0.001), waist circumference (80.41 cm pre- and 76.76 cm post-intervention, p = 0.001), hip circumference (104.6 cm pre- and 101.5 cm post-intervention, p = 0.001) and WHR (0.76 pre- and 0.74 post-intervention, p = 0.001) over the study period. ANCOVA revealed significant between-groups differences in anthropometric measures (p < 0.001 for weight, BMI and waist circumference, p = 0.032 for hip circumference and p = 0.02 for WHR).
