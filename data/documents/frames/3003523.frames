Certolizumab 400 mg	Control	Mental Component Summary improvement	-1	-1	Adjusted mean change from baseline in SF-36 PCS (a) and MCS (b) scores over 52 weeks (ITT population, LOCF). *P < 0.001 for CZP vs PBO
Certolizumab 400 mg	Control	Short-Form 36-Items improvement	17507	17692	ignificantly more patients treated with CZP plus MTX than PBO plus MTX also reported improvements in SF-36 MCS equal to or greater than the MCID from weeks 12 to 52 (Table 2; P < 0.05).
Certolizumab 200 mg	Control	Health-related quality of life improvement	17009	17187	RA patients receiving CZP plus MTX reported statistically significant improvements in HRQoL compared with PBO plus MTX by the first post-baseline assessment (week 12; P < 0.001);
Certolizumab 200 mg	Control	Fatigue Assessment Scale improvement	22548	22719	At week 1, mean changes from baseline in FAS were -1.3 and -1.2 for CZP 200 mg and 400 mg plus MTX, respectively, compared with -0.5 for the PBO plus MTX group (P < 0.001)
Certolizumab 200 mg	Control	Fatigue Assessment Scale improvement	22354	22535	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue were reported by more patients treated with CZP plus MTX than PBO plus MTX throughout the study (P < 0.001;
Certolizumab 400 mg	Control	Short-Form 36-Items improvement	17318	17504	mean changes from baseline at week 12 for the CZP 200 mg plus MTX, CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX groups were 5.6, 5.5 and 2.0 for the SF-36 MCS, respectively (Table 2; P < 0.001)
Certolizumab 200 mg	Control	Short-Form 36-Items improvement	17318	17504	mean changes from baseline at week 12 for the CZP 200 mg plus MTX, CZP 400 mg plus MTX, and PBO plus MTX groups were 5.6, 5.5 and 2.0 for the SF-36 MCS, respectively (Table 2; P < 0.001)
Certolizumab 400 mg	Control	Pain	24252	24570	Significantly more CZP plus MTX-treated patients than PBO plus MTX-treated patients also reported clinically meaningful reductions in pain (Figure 4c) and improvements in global assessment of disease activity (Figure 4d) throughout the trial (P < 0.001). Results were similar regardless of CZP dose (200 mg or 400 mg).
Certolizumab 400 mg	Control	Short-Form 36-Items improvement	-1	-1	Changes from baseline for all SF-36 domains were statistically significant for CZP versus PBO at Weeks 12 and 52; P < 0.05.
