Pomegranate juice (PJ)	baseline	C-reactive protein (CRP), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin and interleukin-6 (IL-6)	10230	10466	there was no significant difference in the circulating concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers namely hsCRP (P = 0.263), ICAM-1 (P = 0.248), VCAM-1 (P = 0.657), E-selectin (P = 0.182), and IL-6 (P = 0.763) following consumption of PJ.
Pomegranate juice (PJ)	baseline	Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)	9925	10109	Comparison of pre- vs. post-trial values revealed a significant reduction in both SBP (P = 0.013) and DBP (P = 0.010), amounting to an approximate reduction by 7% and 6%, respectively.
Pomegranate juice (PJ)	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD)	10110	10209	However, percentage changes in FMD (20%) was not found to be statistically significant (P = 0.172).
Pomegranate juice (PJ)	baseline	Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)	980	1106	Comparison of pre- vs. post-trial values revealed a significant reduction in both SBP (7%; P = 0.013) and DBP (6%; P < 0.010).
Pomegranate juice (PJ)	baseline	flow-mediated dilation (FMD)	1107	1263	However, changes in FMD (20%) as well as circulating levels of CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and IL-6 did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.172).
