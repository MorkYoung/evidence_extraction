trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	pain threshold (lb/cm2)	667	1041	The changes in pain threshold (lb/cm2) showed the values of 6.86±1.35 before first therapy, 11.43±0.27 after first therapy, and 12.57±0.72 after third therapy, while TPI+TENS group showed the values of 6.20±1.92 before first therapy, 8.80±0.48 after first therapy, and 9.60±2.19 after third therapy, and the changes between the groups were significantly different (p=0.045).
extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	The changes in visual analog scale	1042	1457	The changes in visual analog scale were estimated to be 6.86±0.90 before first therapy, 2.86±0.90 after first therapy, and 1.86±0.69 after third therapy in case of ESWT group, whereas the figures were estimated to be 7.20±1.30 before first therapy, 4.60±0.55 after first therapy, and 2.80±0.84 after third therapy in case of TPI+TENS group, and the changes between the groups were significantly different (p=0.010).
trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	pain threshold (lb/cm2)	10891	11033	Effect of the group was found to be significant, resulting in higher pain threshold in the ESWT group in comparison to the TPI and TENS group.
extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	neck range of motion	1594	1684	The changes in neck ROM were also not significantly different between the groups (p>0.05).
extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	neck range of motion	13930	14237	As a result of the Repeated Measure ANOVA carried out on neck range of motion, there was no significant difference between the groups (p>0.05) but also no reciprocal action effect (p>0.05) in all the category, and, in all the categories excluding extension, time (p<0.05) effect was found to be significant.
extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)	trigger point injections (TPI)+transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)	The changes in McGill pain questionnaire	1458	1593	The changes in McGill pain questionnaire (p=0.816) and pain rating scale (p=0.644) between the groups were not significantly different.
