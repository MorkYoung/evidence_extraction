30 μg IFN-β-1a by weekly self-injection for 24 weeks	placebo	deaths, malignancies, hospitalizations, infections requiring intravenous antibiotics occurred, autoimmune events	8703	8894	There were no serious adverse events during the study: no deaths, malignancies, hospitalizations, or infections requiring intravenous antibiotics occurred.
