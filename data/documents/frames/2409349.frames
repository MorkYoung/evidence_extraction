integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux	14265	14496	Figure 3-left illustrates that the prevalence of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux in the index study was significantly higher (P = 0.0003, McNemar's Test) when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.
 integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of both pathologic 24-hour and nocturnal esophageal reflux in the 3rd study	14719	14948	That is, the prevalence of both pathologic 24-hour and nocturnal esophageal reflux in the 3rd study was significantly higher (both P < 0.0001, McNemar's Test) when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.
integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux	14296	14496	the prevalence of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux in the index study was significantly higher (P = 0.0003, McNemar's Test) when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.
integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux	884	1049	The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity
integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic postprandial esophageal reflux in the 3rd study	14990	15194	, the prevalence of pathologic postprandial esophageal reflux in the 3rd study measured as time pH < 4 was not significantly different (P = 0.267, McNemar's Test) from that measured as integrated acidity.
integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux	11268	11497	Figure 1-left illustrates that the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in the index study was significantly higher (P = 0.0005, McNemar's Test) when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.
 integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of both pathologic 24-hour and nocturnal esophageal reflux in the 3rd study	14728	14948	the prevalence of both pathologic 24-hour and nocturnal esophageal reflux in the 3rd study was significantly higher (both P < 0.0001, McNemar's Test) when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity.
integrated acidity	time pH < 4	the prevalence of pathologic postprandial esophageal reflux in the 3rd study	14949	15194	As was also the case with the index study, the prevalence of pathologic postprandial esophageal reflux in the 3rd study measured as time pH < 4 was not significantly different (P = 0.267, McNemar's Test) from that measured as integrated acidity.
