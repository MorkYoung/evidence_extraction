Dry-cured ham	Cooked ham	Vascular cell adhesion protein 1	1543	1619	notably increased for MCP-1 levels (p = 0.023) while VCAM-1 was not affected
Dry-cured ham	Cooked ham	P-selectin 	1339	1541	The mean differences between dry-cured ham and cooked ham followed by a time period adjustment for plasmatic P-selectin and interleukin 6 proteins slightly failed (p = 0.062 and p = 0.049, respectively)
Dry-cured ham	Cooked ham	Toll-like receptor 4	16344	16478	Expression levels of TLR4 in the three monocytes subsets were also strongly affected after the intervention (all p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
Dry-cured ham	Cooked ham	Toll-like receptor 4	1677	1826	The expression of adhesion and scavenging markers (ICAM1R, CXCR4 and TLR4) in the three subsets of monocytes was significantly higher (all p < 0.05).
Dry-cured ham	Cooked ham	Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1	1339	1620	The mean differences between dry-cured ham and cooked ham followed by a time period adjustment for plasmatic P-selectin and interleukin 6 proteins slightly failed (p = 0.062 and p = 0.049, respectively), notably increased for MCP-1 levels (p = 0.023) while VCAM-1 was not affected.
