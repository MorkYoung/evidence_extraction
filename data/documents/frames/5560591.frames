2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Mean patient-controlled analgesia morphine demand	1578	1827	The mean PCA morphine demand was 27.28 (SD = 21.61) times pressed in the EA group and 55.25 (SD = 46.85) times pressed in the control group within 24 hours postoperatively, which showed a significant reduction in the EA group than the control group.
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Total need of morphine 	1839	2048	total morphine requirement was significantly lower in the EA group with the value of 21.38 (SD = 14.38) mg compared to the control group with the value of 33.94 (SD = 20.24) mg within 24 hours postoperatively.
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Total need of morphine 	1828	2048	Similarly, total morphine requirement was significantly lower in the EA group with the value of 21.38 (SD = 14.38) mg compared to the control group with the value of 33.94 (SD = 20.24) mg within 24 hours postoperatively.
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Postoperative numerical rating scale at 30 min and 2 hours	1331	1577	The mean NRS was 2.75 (SD = 2.34) at 30 minutes and 2.25 (SD = 1.80) at 2 hours postoperatively in the EA group that was significantly lower than the mean NRS in the control group as 4.50 (SD = 2.37) at 30 minutes and 3.88 (SD = 2.21) at 2 hours.
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Incidence of nausea 30 min after surgery	2049	2186	Incidence of postoperative nausea also significantly reduced in the EA group at 30 minutes (15.6%) compared to the control group (46.9%).
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Incidence of nausea 30 min after surgery	16795	16919	Incidence of postoperative nausea significantly reduced in EA group at 30 minutes compared to control group (P value < 0.05)
2 Hertz EA stimulation	Control group	Mean pain score at 30 mins and 2 hours after surgery	15705	15846	In this study, the mean pain score was significantly lower in the EA group than the control group at 30 minutes and 2 hours (P value < 0.05).
