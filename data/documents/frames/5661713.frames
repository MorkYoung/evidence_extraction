Flunarizine 5 mg	Control	Serum glutamate levels	11863	12318	Both serum glutamate levels and NRS scores were significantly lower after 15 days treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg flunarizine as well as with 12.5 mg amitriptyline. Serum glutamate decrement levels continued to be significantly higher in flunarizine 5 mg group (1.19 ± 1.13 μg/L) than in flunarizine 10 mg group (0.75 ± 0.60 μg/L) and amitriptyline 12.5 mg group (0.20 ± 0.23 μg/L) (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney post hoc testing).
