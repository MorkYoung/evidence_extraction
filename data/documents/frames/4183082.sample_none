0	91	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	incidence of sore throat and its variants ( sore throat , dry throat , and hoarseness )	The incidence of sore throat and its variants (sore throat, dry throat, and hoarseness) was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group (75%) compared to Cisatracurium group (27.5%) at baseline in the recovery room (P = 0.001).
1	92	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	Number of patients who developed sore throat	Number of patients who developed sore throat was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group (51%) compared to Cisatracurium group (25%) at the time of entrance to the recovery room (P = 0.001).
3	95	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	Number of patients who developed hoarseness	Number of patients who developed hoarseness was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group compared to Cisatracurium group at the time of entrance to the recovery room (37.5% versus 17.5% with P = 0.015) and 2 hours post–operation (15% versus 12.5% with P = 0.046) and the difference was statistically significant.
4	97	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	Number of patients who experienced dryness of the throat	Number of patients who experienced dryness of the throat was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group (57.5%) compared to Cisatracurium group (17.5%) at baseline (57.5% compared to 17.5%) and at 2 hour post–operation (22% compared to 12.5% with P = 0.041).
6	102	Cisatraciruim	Succinylcholine	fasciculation	97.5% of the patients who had received Succinylcholine developed fasciculation, while none of the patients in the Cisatraciruim arm showed similar problem (P < 0.001).
7	103	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	Muscle ache and fasciculation	Muscle ache and fasciculation was experienced in 85% of the patients in Succinylcholine group and 27.5% of the Cisatracurium group (P = 0.002).
8	121	Cisatracurium	Succinylcholine	number of patients who developed sore throat	Our results show that the number of patients who developed sore throat was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group (75%) compared to Cisatracurium group (27.5%) at the time of entrance to the recovery room and 2 hours post–operation (42% in the Succinylcholine group and 17.5% in the Cisatracurium group) (P = 0.027).
