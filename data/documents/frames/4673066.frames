schema-based lecture	traditional	extraneous or germane load	11683	11907	There was no significant difference in reported extraneous (11 vs. 12 points, mean difference = 3 %, standard error = 3 %, p = 0.36) or germane (22 vs 21 points, mean difference = 3 %, standard error = 4.5 %, p = 0.42) load.
schema-based lecture	traditional	evaluation of the lecturers	11909	12078	Fifty-nine (59 %) participants evaluated the lecturers. Participants rated both lecturers similarly (traditional lecture: 4.98 vs schema-based lecture: 5.25, p = 0.114).
schema-based lecture	traditional	extraneous or germane load	1207	1314	There was no significant difference in reported extraneous (p = 0.36) or germane (p = 0.42) cognitive load.
schema-based lecture	traditional	evaluation of the lecturers	11965	12078	Participants rated both lecturers similarly (traditional lecture: 4.98 vs schema-based lecture: 5.25, p = 0.114).
schema-based lecture	traditional	performance on the diagnostic performance test	11389	11527	Schema-based instruction was associated with increased performance on the diagnostic performance test (64 % ± 22 vs 44 % ± 25, p < 0.001).
schema-based lecture	traditional	intrinsic cognitive load	979	1206	Schema-based instruction was associated with increased diagnostic performance on written questions (64 ± 22 % vs 44 ± 25 % p < 0.001) and reduced intrinsic cognitive load (mean difference = 15 %, standard error 3 %, p < 0.001).
schema-based lecture	traditional	intrinsic cognitive load	11529	11682	Participants rated intrinsic cognitive load lower with the schema-based lecture (20 vs 24 points, mean difference = 15 %, standard error 3 %, p < 0.001).
