taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	baseline	HbA1c	18546	18976	. At week 8, the changes from baseline in HbA1c were −1.2 ± 0.1, −0.9 ± 0.1 and −1.2 ± 0.1% in the 20/20-, 20/30- and 20/40-mg arms, respectively [LS mean ± standard error (se)], vs. −0.5 ± 0.1% with placebo (P < 0.0001 in all groups vs. the placebo group). Moreover, the percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0% was 72% (20/20-mg group), 53% (20/30 mg) and 70% (20/40 mg) in the taspoglutide arms vs. 19% in the placebo arm.
taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	placebo	HbA1c	1559	1730	The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0% after 8 weeks of treatment was 72, 53 and 70% in the 20/20-, 20/30- and 20/40-mg arms, respectively, vs. 19% for placebo.
taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	placebo	Fasting plasma glucose	19149	19421	Fasting plasma glucose was reduced (Fig. 5), with LS mean changes from baseline to week 8 of –2.3 ± 0.3 mmol/l (20/20, P < 0.0001 vs. placebo), −1.6 ± 0.3 mmol/l (20/30, P = 0.007 vs. placebo) and −2.2 ± 0.3 mmol/l (20/40, P < 0.0001 vs. placebo) in the active study arms.
taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	placebo	HbA1c	18548	18803	At week 8, the changes from baseline in HbA1c were −1.2 ± 0.1, −0.9 ± 0.1 and −1.2 ± 0.1% in the 20/20-, 20/30- and 20/40-mg arms, respectively [LS mean ± standard error (se)], vs. −0.5 ± 0.1% with placebo (P < 0.0001 in all groups vs. the placebo group).
taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	baseline	HbA1c	18458	18547	Reductions in HbA1c were observed in all taspoglutide-treated arms of the study (Fig. 4).
taspoglutide 20 mg, titration to 30 mg (20/30), 40 mg (20/40)	baseline	nausea and vomiting	1129	1297	The number of patients reporting gastrointestinal AEs did not increase following titration to higher doses of taspoglutide or when continuing the initial 20 mg regimen.
