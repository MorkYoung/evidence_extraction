G4 was prepared with the occlusal extension of 1mm in depth and width. G5: The occlusal extension was 1mm in depth and 2 mm in width	G6: The occlusal extension was 2 mm in depth and 1 mm in width.	fracture resistance	12470	12673	In addition, the fracture resistance of G4 and G5 (MOD1, MOD2) was significantly higher G6 (MOD3) where the preparation of the occlusal extension was 2 mm in the depth and the width (P < 0.05) [Table 2].
G3 was prepared with an occlusal extension that extended one-third of buccolingual width and 2 mm in depth	G6: The occlusal extension was 2 mm in depth and 1 mm in width.	fracture resistance	12816	13028	However, there was no significant difference between G3 and G6 (MOD3) where both groups had the lowest fracture resistance means' values (522 N and 628 N), respectively, among all the groups (P > 0.05) [Table 2].
