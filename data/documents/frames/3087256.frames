Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	baseline	Pain	10506	10668	Pain decreased significantly after 15 mins of epidural injection in all three groups and was statistically significant (p<.001) when VAS was assessed after 15 min
group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), 	sedation score after 3hrs	10765	10905	Group I patients did not show any sedation while group II and III patients showed mild sedation which was significantly higher than group I.
Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)	group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	sensory blockade	1575	1637	Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups.
group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) 	group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	sedation score after 3hrs	10710	11048	Table 4 shows comparison of sedation score after 3hrs. Group I patients did not show any sedation while group II and III patients showed mild sedation which was significantly higher than group I. When comparison between group II and group III was done the latter showed higher sedation score which was statistically significant (p<0.001).
Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)	group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	The number of intramuscular diclofenac injections	9765	9997	The number of intramuscular diclofenac injections ([median, 25th-75th percentile]) during the first 24 h postoperatively was less for the group II (1 or 2) and group III (1 or 2) as compared to the control group (3 or 4). (P < 0.05)
Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)	group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	duration of analgesia	9441	9684	In current study, duration of analgesia i.e the time (min) to first rescue analgesic was significantly longer in group II (200 mins) and group III (210 mins) than group I (130 mins) which was also statistically significant (p<0.001) (Table 1).
Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)	group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	sensory blockade	10046	10225	Regarding level of sensory blockade, no significant difference was found among three groups (Mean sensory block in Gr I was 8.33±0.48, Gr II 8.50±0.78 and in Gr III 8.60 ± 0.77) .
Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml)	group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml)	duration of analgesia	1444	1574	The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent).
