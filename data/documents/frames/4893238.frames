Rebamipide	Placebo	Cryer score	1524	1634	At the end of the study, median Cryer score was 4 in both groups (Difference = 0; 95%CI = −1 to 0; p = 0.728).
Rebamipide	Placebo	Mean tissue PGE2	1778	2051	In the rebamipide group, the mean tissue PGE2 concentration was 999 ± 109 pg/mL before treatment, and 168 ± 13 pg/mL after treatment (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mean tissue PGE2 between the two groups (difference = 5; 95%CI from −334.870 to 345.650; p = 0.975).
Rebamipide	Placebo	Median histopathological scores	16617	16745	At the end of the study, median histopathological scores were also 1 in both groups (Difference = 0; 95%CI = −1 to 1; p = 0.997)
Rebamipide	Placebo	Mean tissue PGE2	16150	16304	There was no difference between the two groups in PGE2 tissue concentration before treatments (difference = 5; 95%CI from −334.870 to 345.650; p = 0.975).
Rebamipide	Placebo	Median histopathological scores	2052	2183	No significant change was observed at the histopathological evaluation, despite the evident macroscopic damage induced by naproxen.
