dominant hand	non-dominant hand	handgrip strength	-1	-1	A significant difference was found in handgrip strength between patients diagnosed with ICU-AW in comparison to those without an ICU-AW diagnosis (6.6 ± 4.4 versus 23.4 ± 8.9 kg, P < 0.01), even when the comparison was adjusted for gender and age (P < 0.01). This was also the case when handgrip performance was expressed in relative values (29.0 ± 22.4% predicted versus 66.0 ± 22.2% predicted, P < 0.01).<NEWLINE> <NEWLINE><NEWLINE> <NEWLINE>In concern to between-sides comparison, patients tended to perform better with the dominant rather than the non-dominant hand (16.2 ± 11.1 versus 14.2 ± 9.9 kg, resp., P = 0.09).
dominant hand	non-dominant hand	handgrip strength	12476	12654	In concern to between-sides comparison, patients tended to perform better with the dominant rather than the non-dominant hand (16.2 ± 11.1 versus 14.2 ± 9.9 kg, resp., P = 0.09).
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)	control	the total MRC score of the legs	10908	11299	No significant between-group differences were observed for the MRC score of the left and the right arm either, while the MRC scores of the left and right legs were significantly higher in the EMS group. Similar between-group results were found for the total MRC score of the arms (EMS: 28 (26–30); control: 26 (22–30), P = 0.16) and the legs (EMS: 29 (26–30); control: 25 (20–28), P = 0.01).
Intensive Care Unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW)	without an ICU-AW diagnosis	handgrip strength	12068	12326	A significant difference was found in handgrip strength between patients diagnosed with ICU-AW in comparison to those without an ICU-AW diagnosis (6.6 ± 4.4 versus 23.4 ± 8.9 kg, P < 0.01), even when the comparison was adjusted for gender and age (P < 0.01).
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)	control	wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion	881	1015	EMS patients achieved higher MRC scores than controls (P ≤ 0.05) in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)	control	wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion	782	1016	Twenty four patients in the EMS group and 28 patients in the control group were finally evaluated. EMS patients achieved higher MRC scores than controls (P ≤ 0.05) in wrist flexion, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion.
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)	control	the total MRC score of the legs	1017	1097	Collectively, the EMS group performed higher (P < 0.01) in the legs and overall.
