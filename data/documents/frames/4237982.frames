Intensive lifestyle intervention	Control	Body weight in women	15458	15658	The mean ± SD of the weight changes was −0.52 ± 3.62 kg (P = 0.31) in the DSE group and −7.24 ± 5.40 kg (P < 0.0001) in the ILI group. Weight loss in the ILI group was ∼7% in females and ∼10% in males
Intensive lifestyle intervention	Control	Total adipose tissue in women	1296	1391	Mean ILI changes were different from DSE (P < 0.001 for TAT, SAT, and IMAT and P < 0.01 for VAT
Intensive lifestyle intervention	Control	Visceral adipose tissue in women	1296	1391	Mean ILI changes were different from DSE (P < 0.001 for TAT, SAT, and IMAT and P < 0.01 for VAT
Intensive lifestyle intervention	Control	Subcutaneous adipose tissue in women	1296	1524	Mean ILI changes were different from DSE (P < 0.001 for TAT, SAT, and IMAT and P < 0.01 for VAT in females). Within ILI, SAT and VAT decreased in males and females (P < 0.0001), but IMAT was unchanged (0.00 ± 0.54 kg; P = 0.99).
