group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	patient immobility	967	1063	Both group A and B were comparable with respect to patient immobility and hemodynamic stability.
group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	mean arterial pressure (MAP)	8288	8432	There was no statistical difference between the groups (P > 0.05) with respect to MAP at preinduction and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min

group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	preinduction HR (heart rate)	7741	7791	The preinduction HR was comparable in both groups.
group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	mean arterial pressure (MAP)	8288	8453	There was no statistical difference between the groups (P > 0.05) with respect to MAP at preinduction and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min [Table 4, Figure 2].
group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	hemodynamic stability	967	1063	Both group A and B were comparable with respect to patient immobility and hemodynamic stability.
group A patients received transtracheal block with 4 ml of 4% lidocaine	no block was given to patients in group B	preinduction HR (heart rate)	7741	8028	The preinduction HR was comparable in both groups. When the difference in mean of the preinduction value of HR to mean values of HR at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min were compared between groups, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the groups (P > 0.05)
