Aloe vera mouthrinse	Chlorhexidene mouthrinse	Plaque levels	11407	11538	The difference in the decreases in plaque (P=1.921 at the 4th day) between Group I and Group II were not statistically significant.
Chlorhexidene mouthrinse	Placebo	Plaque levels	1333	1492	There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p>0.05).
Aloe vera mouthrinse	Chlorhexidene mouthrinse	Plaque levels	1333	1492	There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p>0.05).
Aloe vera mouthrinse	Placebo	Plaque levels	10958	11086	There was a significant decrease in the plaque in both the Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups over a period of 4 days (P < 0.05)
Aloe vera mouthrinse	Placebo	Plaque levels	10958	11797	There was a significant decrease in the plaque in both the Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups over a period of 4 days (P < 0.05) (Tables 2, 3). There was a progressive decrease in the plaque score at 5% level of significance in both chlorhexidine and Aloe vera groups. Chlorhexidine group showed maximum decease as compared to Aloe vera group but the difference was not statistically significant. Multiple comparisons were obtained by Post-hoc LSD. The difference in the decreases in plaque (P=1.921 at the 4th day) between Group I and Group II were not statistically significant. However, the differences between Aloe vera and the placebo group and chlorhexidine and the placebo group were significant (P <.05). The study showed that there was no difference in the Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups as far as plaque scores are concerned.
