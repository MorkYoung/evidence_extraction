assistance from a patient navigator	usual care	Appointment adherence, exemplified by the attendance of one or more follow-up visits	1638	1795	Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of ≥1 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28).
assistance from a patient navigator	usual care	adherence rates for patients who attended two or more follow-up appointments	18959	19171	A subanalysis was conducted to analyze whether subjects attended ≥ follow-up visits. The results are: 91.3% (n=21/23) of G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) of G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) of G3 attended ≥2 follow-up visits (P=0.11).
