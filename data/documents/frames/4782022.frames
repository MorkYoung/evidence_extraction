Chemotherapy + goserelin	Chemotherapy 	Bone alkaline phosphatase after 36 months	1340	1554	BALP remained significantly higher compared to baseline at 12, 24 and 36 months in patients receiving CT, resulting in a significant difference between treatment groups at 36 months (CT+G 5.845 vs CT 8.5 p=0.0006).
Chemotherapy + goserelin	Chemotherapy 	Bone alkaline phosphatase after 36 months	1011	1554	In the overall population, there was a significant increase in NTX at 6 months compared to baseline in patients treated with CT+G (40.81 vs 57.82 p=0.0074) with normalisation of levels thereafter. BALP was significantly increased compared to baseline at 6 months and 12 months in those receiving CT+G, but normalised thereafter. BALP remained significantly higher compared to baseline at 12, 24 and 36 months in patients receiving CT, resulting in a significant difference between treatment groups at 36 months (CT+G 5.845 vs CT 8.5 p=0.0006).
Chemotherapy + goserelin	Chemotherapy 	N-terminal telopeptide after 6 months	10664	11023	Acute/on treatment median [IQR] NTX was significantly increased at 6 months (6/12) in patients treated with CT+G (6/12=57.8 [39.4–72.9] p=0.0030). This acute effect on bone resorption was not seen in patients treated with CT (37.07 [27.5–59.1]), resulting in a significantly higher NTX level at 6 months in the CT+G group compared with the CT group (p=0.0032)
Chemotherapy + goserelin	Chemotherapy 	N-terminal telopeptide after 6 months	1011	1207	In the overall population, there was a significant increase in NTX at 6 months compared to baseline in patients treated with CT+G (40.81 vs 57.82 p=0.0074) with normalisation of levels thereafter.
