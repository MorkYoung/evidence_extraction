Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Number of analgesic administrations	9833	10045	number of analgesic administrations was significantly lower in the II phase interventions group (between-groups effect of intervention, P < 0.001; between-groups effect of time-intervention interaction, P < 0.001
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Postoperative days until discharge	9014	9163	I phase patients were discharged on average after 5.4 days, while II phase patients were discharged on average after 3.6 days (mean difference: 1.8).
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Postoperative days until discharge	8881	9163	Statistically significant differences were observed between the study groups in terms of postoperative day at discharge (P < 0.001). I phase patients were discharged on average after 5.4 days, while II phase patients were discharged on average after 3.6 days (mean difference: 1.8).
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Time to restart normal diet	-1	-1	In IP procedures
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Number of analgesic administrations	9824	9978	Also the number of analgesic administrations was significantly lower in the II phase interventions group (between-groups effect of intervention, P < 0.001
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Time to restart normal diet	18177	18248	all the patients recovered a normal diet after 3 weeks postoperatively.
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Postoperative apnea-hypopnea index	9164	9398	Differences in postoperative AHI were also statistically significant (crude P = 0.018; I phase mean postop AHI: 7.3, II phase mean postop AHI: 3.2; mean difference: 4.1), even after adjusting for preoperative AHI (adjusted P = 0.013).
Phase I Surgery	Phase II Surgery	Time to restart normal diet	10338	10532	Postoperative diet differed significantly between the groups during the whole analyzed postoperative period, as I phase patients could restart a normal diet before compared to II phase patients.
