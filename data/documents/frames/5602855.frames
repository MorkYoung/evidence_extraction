good motivation/capability	inadequate motivation/capability	Quality of life	-1	-1	The EQ-5D-3L summary index is shown in Fig. 2. No significant change could be observed in the anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-3L system either in those with good (p = 0.26) or inadequate (p = 0.71) motivation/capability during the three years of follow-up. Additionally, no change was observed in the EQ-5D-3L summary index (p = 0.14), EQ VAS (p = 0.68) or the anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-3L system (p = 0.95) during the follow-up in those subjects who continued pulse palpation at least weekly at 36 months.Fig. 2
