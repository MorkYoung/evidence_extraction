T-EO formulation	Af-EO formulation	Reduction of thickness of the PL-biofilm after a single mouthwash	1311	1408	The mean thickness of the PL-biofilm after rinsing was not affected by any of the EO formulations
T-EO formulation and Af-EO formulation	Sterile water	Overall effectiveness after 4 days	1444	1602	After 4 days, the T-EO and Af-EO solutions were significantly more effective than the WATER, reducing the BV, thickness, and CG of the PL-biofilm (P < 0.001).
T-EO formulation 	Af-EO formulation	Bacterial viability	23998	24229	The mean BV at baseline ranged between 63.99 ± 19.7% and 79.54 ± 5.31% for all the three rising protocols, with no statistical differences between them. Both EO formulations achieved similar results at all the time points measured.
T-EO formulation	Af-EO formulation	Reduction of thickness and CG of the PL-biofilm	1603	1866	Although, both EO antiseptics presented a similar bactericidal activity, the Af-EO rinses led to more significant reductions in the thickness and CG of the PL-biofilm than the T-EO rinses (thickness = 7.90 vs. 9.92 μm, P = 0.012; CG = 33.36 vs. 46.61%, P = 0.001)

Although, both EO antiseptics presented a similar bactericidal activity, the Af-EO rinses led to more significant reductions in the thickness and CG of the PL-biofilm than the T-EO rinses (thickness = 7.90 vs. 9.92 μm, P = 0.012; CG = 33.36 vs. 46.61%, P = 0.001).

T-EO formulation	Af-EO formulation	Reduction of thickness of the PL-biofilm after a single mouthwash	23495	23864	Neither the T-EO nor the Af-EO antiseptics could reduce the thickness of the PL-biofilm of 48 h after a single application. Their baseline thicknesses were 21.81 ± 5.28 μm and 20.71 ± 4.13 μm, respectively. After a single mouthwash, the thicknesses were slightly reduced (20.19 ± 3.62 μm and 18.58 ± 3.14 μm, respectively), but did not achieve statistical significance.
T-EO formulation and Af-EO formulation	Sterile water	Overall effectiveness after 4 days	32098	32388	The T-EO and Af-EO formulations after 4 days of use showed similar effectiveness in maintaining the BV at significantly lower levels than the negative control (BV for 4D-T-EO and 4D-Af-EO vs. 4D-WATER = 26.27 ± 14.61% and 31.08 ± 16.52% vs. 51.35 ± 5.38%, respectively; P < 0.001; Table 2).
