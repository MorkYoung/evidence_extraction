Salbutamol 	Placebo	Duration of infusion	16033	16198	The duration of infusion was on average 24·5 h (95% CI 12·3–36·7) shorter in the salbutamol group than in the placebo group (mean 114·1 h [SD 62·7] vs 138·6 h [47·9]
Salbutamol 	Placebo	Mortality before ICU discharge 	16877	17045	The number of deaths before discharge from either intensive-care unit or hospital did not differ significantly between groups (p=0·10 and p=0·26, respectively; table 2)
Salbutamol 	Placebo	Mortality before ICU discharge 	16877	17035	The number of deaths before discharge from either intensive-care unit or hospital did not differ significantly between groups (p=0·10 and p=0·26, respectively
Salbutamol 	Placebo	Overall mortality 	16434	16765	More patients died 28 days after randomisation in the salbutamol group than in the placebo group (RR 1·47, 95% CI 1·03–2·08; p=0·03; table 2). Survival analysis of the primary outcome (figure 3) showed a hazard ratio of 1·56 (95% CI 1·03–2·36). Salbutamol resulted in a 10·9% (95% CI 1·0–20·4) absolute increase in 28-day mortality
