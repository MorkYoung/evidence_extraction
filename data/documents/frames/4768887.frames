Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)	computed tomography (CT)	removal of more involved lymph nodes, their stations	526	894	Compared to the CT group, the right-sided approach was more frequently used (42.6% versus 25.5%, P=0.065) in the PET/CT group in order to allow surgical access to radiographically suspicious lymph nodes inaccessible from the left, thus enabling the removal of more involved lymph nodes (2.83 versus 1.76; P=0.039) as well as their stations (1.65 versus 1.08; P=0.042).
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)	computed tomography (CT)	Overall survival (OS)	18035	18259	The estimated mean OS for the PET/CT group (28.4 months; 95% CI: 24.1–32.7 months) was slightly higher than that for the CT group (25.7 months; 95% CI: 21.7–29.6 months) but did not achieve statistical significance (P=0.38).
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)	computed tomography (CT)	overall sensitivity and an accuracy in the detection of the metastasis	17498	17721	On a station-based analysis, PET/CT displayed an overall sensitivity of 86.5% and an accuracy of 92.2% in the detection of the metastasis. CT showed a lower sensitivity of 67.3% (P=0.006) and an accuracy of 87.2% (P=0.024).

Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)	computed tomography (CT)	Disease-free survival (DFS)	895	1174	Although the overall survival between the two groups was similar, the PET/CT group had a longer disease-free survival (DFS) than the CT group (27.1 months versus 18.9 months; P=0.019), especially in the subgroup of node-positive patients (22.5 months versus 13.5 months; P=0.02).
