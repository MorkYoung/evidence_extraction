Multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) group	Placebo group	Levels of nitrate/nitrite (NOx), cortisol, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)	1678	1800	There was no group × time interaction for HR, BP, blood glucose, lipids, NOx, hs-CRP, cortisol concentrations or body fat.
Multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) group	Placebo group	Lipid parameters	1678	1800	There was no group × time interaction for HR, BP, blood glucose, lipids, NOx, hs-CRP, cortisol concentrations or body fat.
Multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) group	Placebo group	Total body mass and fat-free mass 	2248	2495	Six weeks of MIPS ingestion and periodized RT does not alter CV health parameters or blood indices of health or body fat more than a Placebo treatment in healthy, resistance-trained men. However, MIPS significantly increased FFM more than Placebo.

Multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) group	Placebo group	Total body mass and fat-free mass 	23047	23290	Total body mass (Table 3) was increased in both groups (p < 0.0001) but more so in MIPS than Placebo (p = 0.024). FFM (Table 3) was increased in both groups (p < 0.0001); however, the increases were significantly greater with MIPS (p = 0.025).
