high fat diets (HF diet)	control	fetal weight at d 90 of gestation	12298	12409	Feeding HF diet markedly increased the fetal weight (in average 585 g vs.508 g, P < 0.05) at d 90 of gestation.
high fat diets (HF diet)	control	intestinal villous height of fetus	-1	-1	Feeding HF diet tended to increase intestinal villous height (P = 0.055), but decrease crypt depth (P = 0.098) of fetus (Fig. 1).
high fat diets (HF diet)	control	lactase activity of fetus	-1	-1	lactase activity was markedly increased (+55 %, P < 0.05) by feeding HF diet relative to CON diet
high fat diets (HF diet)	control	maltase activity of fetus	-1	-1	the maltase activity did not markedly differ between groups
high fat diets (HF diet)	control	lactase activity of fetus	-1	-1	the lactase activity was markedly increased (+55 %, P < 0.05) by feeding HF diet relative to CON diet
