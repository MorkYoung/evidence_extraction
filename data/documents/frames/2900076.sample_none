2	92	tranexamic acid	placebo	total number of transfused units	The total number of transfused units was 12 in the prophylactic group of 43 patients as against 40 in the placebo group of 43 (p = 0.002).4  Patients in the tranexamic acid group were given 4 units of blood in total, compared with 26 units in the control group.
3	102	Tranexamic acid	TXA	perioperative bleeding	In conclusion, TXA reduces perioperative bleeding by almost a half in patients undergoing TKR, and reducing blood transfusion requirement in these patients by almost 80%.It is also tempting to determine if additional benefit could be achieved by repeating the Tranexamic acid in the post operative period.
