sevoflurane	propofol	postoperative pulmonary complications after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time	20637	20912	Postoperative pulmonary complications were lower in the sevoflurane group, with an OR of 0.4, but not statistically significant in comparison with the propofol group I in either the unadjusted logistic regression model or after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time
sevoflurane	propofol	mean oxygenation index after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time	20353	20512	The mean oxygenation index in the sevoflurane group was 42 points higher on POD1 compared with the propofol group in the unadjusted model (P = 0.04) (Table 4).
sevoflurane	propofol	postoperative sedation have any beneficial effects on myocardial injury in cardiac surgery patients after on-pump valve replacement.	1253	1557	Concentration of troponin T as the most sensitive marker for myocardial injury at POD1 was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared with the propofol group (unadjusted difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1; P < 0.01; adjusted difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to -0.02; P = 0.03, respectively)
sevoflurane	propofol	Concentration of troponin T	1253	1558	Concentration of troponin T as the most sensitive marker for myocardial injury at POD1 was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared with the propofol group (unadjusted difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1; P < 0.01; adjusted difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to -0.02; P = 0.03, respectively).
sevoflurane	propofol	Concentration of troponin T	1253	1557	Concentration of troponin T as the most sensitive marker for myocardial injury at POD1 was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared with the propofol group (unadjusted difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1; P < 0.01; adjusted difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to -0.02; P = 0.03, respectively)
sevoflurane	propofol	mean oxygenation index after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time	20513	20636	After adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time, the difference decreased to 27 points and was no longer significant.
sevoflurane	propofol	postoperative pulmonary complications after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time	20635	20912	. Postoperative pulmonary complications were lower in the sevoflurane group, with an OR of 0.4, but not statistically significant in comparison with the propofol group I in either the unadjusted logistic regression model or after adjusting for age, blood products, and ECC time
sevoflurane	propofol	postoperative sedation have any beneficial effects on myocardial injury in cardiac surgery patients after on-pump valve replacement.	18637	19117	In the subgroup of patients with aortic valve surgery (28 in the propofol and 27 in the sevoflurane group), the following results were assessed: The unadjusted difference in means between the propofol group and the sevoflurane group was 0.5 μg/L for troponin T on POD1 (CI, -0.8 to -0.1; P = 0.006) (Table 3). The adjusted difference in means between the groups was 0.3 μg/L (CI, -0.6 to -0.1; P = 0.02). The same model of multiple linear regression was used as described earlier.
