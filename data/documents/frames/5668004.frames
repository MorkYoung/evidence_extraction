complete treatment response	partial treatment response	GLUT-1 expression	959	1099	VEGF and GLUT-1 expression were significantly positively associated with complete response (CR) to treatment in all leave-one-out iterations
High Basal HB levels	Low Basal HB levels	risk of death	9460	9561	Hb basal level was associated with a higher risk of death in 98 of 108 (≈91%) leave-one-out iteration
complete treatment response	partial treatment response	vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression	959	1099	VEGF and GLUT-1 expression were significantly positively associated with complete response (CR) to treatment in all leave-one-out iterations
High Basal HB levels	Low Basal HB levels	risk of death	9411	9696	The reduced elastic net model for OS showed that Hb basal level was associated with a higher risk of death in 98 of 108 (≈91%) leave-one-out iterations. HIF-1 α expression intensity was also correlated with the risk of death in 84 out of 108 (≈78%) iterations (Supplementary Figure 2).
complete treatment response	partial treatment response	GLUT-1 expression	959	1100	VEGF and GLUT-1 expression were significantly positively associated with complete response (CR) to treatment in all leave-one-out iterations.
pathological complete response (pCR)	NON-pathological complete response	Basal HB levels	15242	15341	Basal HB levels (≥ 13 gr/dl-1) expression was positively correlated with pCR as previously observed
