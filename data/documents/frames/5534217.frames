peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	total symptom scores (TSSs)	16917	17059	The intergroup difference of TSSs did not achieve significance (P = .051 at day 2). The change in infectious virus titer is shown in Figure 2.
peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	virus titer	17060	17312	The median time for the virus titer to decrease by <101.5 TCID50/mL was approximately 4 days in both groups (Kaplan-Meier method, post hoc analysis); this parameter did not reveal a statistically significant intergroup difference (P = .51; χ2 = 0.436).
peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	The numbers of days required for the disappearance of influenza symptoms	16341	16566	The numbers of days (mean ± SE) required for the disappearance of influenza symptoms were 5.26 ± 0.15 and 5.38 ± 0.16 days for the peramivir and the oseltamivir groups, respectively (log-rank test; P = .65; χ2 value = 0.204).
peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	total symptom scores (TSSs)	16567	16836	Table 2 shows the change of variation of the TSSs. The scores decreased over time, falling from −2.5 (peramivir) and −1.3 (oseltamivir) on day 2, to −7.1 (peramivir) and −5.9 (oseltamivir) on day 5; significant intergroup differences were not detected for this paramete
peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	virus titer	17313	17452	The decrease of virus titer was examined by virus type and subtype, but no significant intergroup difference was detected (data not shown).
peramivir (Rapiacta)	oseltamivir (Tamiflu)	fever-alleviation time	14756	15057	The respective medians of fever-alleviation time were 40.0 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.3–64.5) and 37.8 hours (95% CI = 26.3–45.3) in the peramivir and oseltamivir groups, respectively; these values did not exhibit a significant intergroup difference (log-rank test; P = .69; χ2 = 0.156).
