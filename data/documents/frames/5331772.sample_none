6	75	exercise + placebo	exercise + ginger	VO2max	On the other hand, the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significant increase in VO2max; P = 0.012 and P = 0.012, and a significant decrease in MCP-1 concentration; P = 0.025 and P = 0.012 in "exercise + ginger" and "exercise + placebo," respectively, after 10 weeks of intervention [Table 3].
