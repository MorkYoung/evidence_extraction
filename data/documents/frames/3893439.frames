Environmental enrichment	Control	pAMPK/AMPK ratio in prefrontal cortex	22927	23182	We found significant main effects of injury (F(3,30) = 10.93, p < 0.05) and EE housing (F(3,30) = 10.48, p < 0.05) on pAMPK/AMPK ratio in the prefrontal cortex where mTBI resulted in significantly decrease pAMPK/AMPK ratio in comparison to the sham groups
Environmental enrichment	Control	pAMPK/AMPK ratio in the hippocampus 	23624	23871	Examination of pAMPK/AMPK ratio in the hippocampus also showed significant main effects of mTBI (F(3,30) = 11.33, p < 0.05) and housing condition (F(3,30) = 12.11, p < 0.05) with the pattern of changes similar to that seen in the prefrontal cortex

Mild TBI	Control	Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase	24047	24187	Significantly decreased uMtCK expression was seen in the prefrontal cortex after mTBI (F(3,30) = 9.61, p < 0.05) compared to the sham groups

Environmental enrichment	Control	pAMPK/AMPK ratio in the hippocampus 	1465	1759	Our results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.
