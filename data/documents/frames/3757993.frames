multimedia intervention	control	INTERHEART risk score (IHRS)	28761	29133	the intervention group had a significant reduction in their IHRS score at follow-up (intervention group baseline IHRS: mean 13.4, SD 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 12.1, SD 5.9, P=.002), and a trend was seen in the control group (baseline IHRS: mean 12.6, SD 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 11.7, SD 5.9, P=.05) (see Table 2), though these results were not statistically significant.
multimedia intervention	control	changes in diet, physical activity, and weight loss	30814	31176	more than 13.9% (51/367) of participants progressed from inactive (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation) to the active (action, maintenance) stage in diet and physical activity, and 12.5% (46/367) progressed to the active stage in weight loss plans; however, no significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups (Table 6).
multimedia intervention	control	INTERHEART risk score (IHRS)	28715	29133	Comparing follow-up to baseline score change, the intervention group had a significant reduction in their IHRS score at follow-up (intervention group baseline IHRS: mean 13.4, SD 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 12.1, SD 5.9, P=.002), and a trend was seen in the control group (baseline IHRS: mean 12.6, SD 5.8; follow-up IHRS: mean 11.7, SD 5.9, P=.05) (see Table 2), though these results were not statistically significant.
multimedia intervention	control	The mean number of login attempts	23385	23726	The mean number of login attempts of the intervention group mean was 2.64 (SD 3.17, median 2.0) and the control group was 1.63 (SD 2.14, median 1.0). The difference between intervention and control groups login was statistically significant as expected since the intervention group was asked to set goals (Wilcoxon two-sample test, P=.0003).
