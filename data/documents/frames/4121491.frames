Desflurane 	Intravenous anesthesia + propofol + remifentanil	Core temperature	12001	12116	Final core temperature was significantly higher in group 2 (35.4 ± 0.7°C) than in group 1 (34.9 ± 0.5°C) (Table 2).
Desflurane 	Intravenous anesthesia + propofol + remifentanil	Core temperature	1232	1341	The final core temperature was significantly higher in group 2 (35.4 ± 0.7°C) than in group 1 (34.9 ± 0.5°C).
Desflurane 	Intravenous anesthesia + propofol + remifentanil	Vasoconstriction threshold 	12400	12732	The time taken for reaching the thermoregulatory vasoconstriction threshold was 151.4 ± 19.7 minutes in group 1 and 88.9 ± 14.4 minutes in group 2 (Table 2). This means peripheral vasoconstriction occurred more frequently and shortly in group 2. However, there was no difference in the vasoconstriction threshold between the groups.
Desflurane 	Intravenous anesthesia + propofol + remifentanil	Vasoconstriction threshold 	12646	12732	However, there was no difference in the vasoconstriction threshold between the groups.
