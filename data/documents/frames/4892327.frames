Ischemia group	Sham group	Bax/Bcl-2 ratio	1278	1405	Also, results indicated a significant increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in ischemia group, compared to sham-operated group (P<0.001).
Ischemia group	Sham group or exercise group	Bcl-2 protein levels	13776	14060	, there were no significant difference among groups with respect to the number of Bcl-2-positive cells. The levels of Bcl-2 in ischemia group (30.6±4.98, in 0.160 mm2) showed no statistically significant difference compared to sham-operated group (25.5±0.707, in 0.160 mm2), (P>0.05).
Ischemia group	Sham group	Active caspase-3-positive neurons in CA1 area	980	1129	The number of active caspase-3-positive neurons in CA1 area were significantly increased in ischemia group, compared to sham-operated group (P<0.001)
Ischemia group	Exercise group	Ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation	1135	1277	exercise preconditioning significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation, compared to the ischemia group (P<0.05).
Ischemia group	Sham group or exercise group	Bcl-2 protein levels	13880	14210	The levels of Bcl-2 in ischemia group (30.6±4.98, in 0.160 mm2) showed no statistically significant difference compared to sham-operated group (25.5±0.707, in 0.160 mm2), (P>0.05). Also levels of Bcl-2 in exercise group (25.86±3.532, in 0.160 mm2) showed no statistically significant difference compared to ischemia group (P>0.05)
Ischemia group	Sham group	Bax/Bcl-2 ratio	1284	1405	results indicated a significant increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in ischemia group, compared to sham-operated group (P<0.001).
