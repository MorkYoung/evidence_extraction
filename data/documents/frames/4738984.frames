positive input	negative input	symptom endorsement prediction	17393	17622	participants in the favorable somatic information group (M = 10.30, SD = 5.04) reported less symptom intensity relative to those receiving the unfavorable somatic information (M = 11.52, SD = 4.37); t = âˆ’1.79, df = 182, p = .038.
positive input	negative input	symptom endorsement prediction	18735	19693	However, somatosensory amplification did have a significant impact on the endorsement of the heart rate item (R2= .045, F1, 192= 9.80, b = .209, t = 2.93, p = .004), with higher somatosensory amplification resulting in the tendency to endorse the heart rate symptom even after controlling for condition. Somatosensory amplification (SSAS) was also significantly and positively correlated with the endorsement of three other PSQ symptoms that directly related to physical symptoms experienced during the exercise session, difficulty breathing (r = .21, N = 194, p = .004), heartburn (r = .20, N = 194, p = .005), and leg cramps (r = .23, N = 194, p = .001). In addition, results showed somatosensory scores to predict the sum of all symptoms (PSQsum); R2= .078, F1, 192= 16.3, p < .001. These findings suggest that the validity of the SSAS may extend beyond the general trait of body awareness and also predict the state-level occurrence of symptom reporting.
positive input	negative input	performance prediction	16858	17319	Additionally, the SSAS was used to examine the effect of somatosensory amplification on performance. A regression analysis indicated that it was not an independent predictor of performance after controlling for the variance explained by condition (R2change< .001, Fchange= .016, b = .019, t = .258, p = .797). This indicates that general body awareness does not affect performance, nor was there an interaction between condition and somatosensory amplification.
