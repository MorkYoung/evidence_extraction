Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	C-peptide AUC	17073	17277	During the course of the study, the C-peptide AUC fell to a similar extent and significantly from baseline in each group (table 2); comparison of these differences was not significant (p=0·91; figure 2A).
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	Blood glucose AUC	17278	17486	Blood glucose AUC rose by 2·04 mmol/L (95% CI 1·09–2·99) in the treatment group and 3·05 mmol/L (95% CI 1·17–4·92) in the placebo group, and was not significantly different between groups (p=0·23; figure 2B).
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	Insulin use	17631	17862	Insulin use increased with time in both groups, and was significantly increased for the treatment group over time. The increase was not significant for the placebo group or significantly different between groups (p=0·31; figure 2D)
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	C-peptide AUC	17073	17276	During the course of the study, the C-peptide AUC fell to a similar extent and significantly from baseline in each group (table 2); comparison of these differences was not significant (p=0·91; figure 2A)
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	Blood glucose AUC	17278	17473	Blood glucose AUC rose by 2·04 mmol/L (95% CI 1·09–2·99) in the treatment group and 3·05 mmol/L (95% CI 1·17–4·92) in the placebo group, and was not significantly different between groups (p=0·23
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	Hypoglyacemic events	18498	18646	The frequencies of various adverse events and the frequencies of hypoglyacemic events did not differ significantly between the two groups (table 3).
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	Hypoglyacemic events	18362	18635	87 events were identified as possibly related to treatment, but were distributed equally between treatment and placebo groups (p=0·71). The frequencies of various adverse events and the frequencies of hypoglyacemic events did not differ significantly between the two groups
Sitagliptin and lansoprazole	Placebo	IDA-A1C	17864	18038	IDA-A1C increased slightly in both groups; the increase was significant for the treatment group with time, but not for the placebo group or between groups (p=0·8; figure 2E).
