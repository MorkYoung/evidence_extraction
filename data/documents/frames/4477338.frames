3.9 g/day EPA+DHA	placebo	serum triglyceride levels	20798	20898	serum triglyceride levels decreased in the n-3 group and increased in the placebo group (P = 0.012).
3.9 g/day EPA+DHA	placebo	serum triglyceride levels	20785	20898	As expected, serum triglyceride levels decreased in the n-3 group and increased in the placebo group (P = 0.012).
3.9 g/day EPA+DHA	placebo	percent suppression of Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP)	1438	1625	Hepatic insulin sensitivity, determined from the suppression of endogenous glucose production by insulin, exhibited a small but significant improvement with EPA+DHA compared with placebo.
3.9 g/day EPA+DHA	placebo	percent suppression of Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP)	21899	22128	EGP was modestly suppressed during the low-dose insulin infusion (Fig. 1E and F), but the percent suppression decreased by 12% on average in the placebo group and increased by 15% on average in the n-3 group (P = 0.024) (Fig. 1G)
3.9 g/day EPA+DHA	placebo	Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL	20721	20784	Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL, did not change in either group.
