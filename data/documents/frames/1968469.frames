MPA (100 mg tds orally) 	placebo	change in anthropometric measurements, weight, performance status, energy, mood or pain	1383	1499	There was no change in anthropometric measurements, weight, performance status, energy, mood or pain in either group
MPA (100 mg tds orally) 	placebo	appetite between weeks 0 (pre-study) and 3 and 0 and 6	895	1101	here was a significant improvement in appetite in the MPA group between weeks 0 (pre-study) and 3 (P = 0.0002) and 0 and 6 (P = 0.015).

MPA (100 mg tds orally) 	placebo	appetite between weeks 0 (pre-study) and 3 and 0 and 6	894	1030	There was a significant improvement in appetite in the MPA group between weeks 0 (pre-study) and 3 (P = 0.0002) and 0 and 6 (P = 0.015).
MPA (100 mg tds orally) 	placebo	serum thyroid binding pre-albumin and retinol binding protein	1102	1382	Supporting this finding was the significant increase in serum thyroid binding pre-albumin and retinol binding protein in the MPA group between weeks 0 and 3 and 0 and 6 (P = 0.023 and P = 0.039 respectively). These two parameters showed no significant change in the placebo group.
