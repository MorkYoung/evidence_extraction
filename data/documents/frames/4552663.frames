Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	Vasopressor use during the surgery	1466	1592	No significant differences existed between the groups regarding intraoperative vasopressor use during the surgery (p = 0.475).
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	Baseline characteristics	13171	13343	We could not find any statistically significant differences among the groups in the patients' baseline characteristics, preexisting medical conditions, and surgical factors
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	QoR-40 scores	15020	15234	no statistical and clinical differences (p = 0.916) were detected between the global QoR-40 scores from the different treatment groups (Table 3). Likewise, there were no differences in each dimensions of the QoR-40
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	Quality of recovery after surgery	1266	1465	The median [interquartile range (IQR)] global QoR-40 scores 24 h after the surgery were 187 [177–197], 186 [171–200], and 184 [171–198] for the CHO, ORS, and control groups, respectively (p = 0.916).
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	QoR-40 scores	1266	1465	The median [interquartile range (IQR)] global QoR-40 scores 24 h after the surgery were 187 [177–197], 186 [171–200], and 184 [171–198] for the CHO, ORS, and control groups, respectively (p = 0.916).
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	PONV incidence	16832	16988	incidence of PONV did not differ significantly among the treatment groups in either the intention-to-treat (p = 1.000) or per-protocol analyses (p = 1.000).
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	Baseline characteristics	13171	13354	We could not find any statistically significant differences among the groups in the patients' baseline characteristics, preexisting medical conditions, and surgical factors (Table 2).
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	Quality of recovery after surgery	1616	1816	Results of the current study indicated that the preoperative administration of either CHO or ORS did not improve the quality of recovery in patients undergoing minimally invasive body surface surgery.
Oral carbohydrate group or oral rehydration solution group	Control group	PONV incidence	16828	16988	the incidence of PONV did not differ significantly among the treatment groups in either the intention-to-treat (p = 1.000) or per-protocol analyses (p = 1.000).
