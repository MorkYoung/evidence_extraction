Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Blood pressure	16985	17091	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell in both groups, without a significant between-group difference.
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Changes in electrochemical skin conductance in the foot	17442	17676	Average foot conductance as measured by a Sudoscan device showed a decrease in sudomotor nerve function in the control group (−11.7 microseimens), but a non-significant improvement in the intervention group (0.7 microseimens, P=0.03).
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Changes in electrochemical skin conductance in the foot	20037	20264	Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot declined in the control group, but stayed essentially constant in the intervention group, suggesting that the intervention may have slowed or halted sudomotor nerve function decline.
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Lipid profile	16544	16800	Total cholesterol declined 12.1 mg dl−1 in the intervention group and 2.2 mg dl−1 in the control group (P=0.20). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol declined 7.8 mg dl−1 in the intervention group, but increased by 0.4 mg dl−1 in the control group (P=0.35).
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Improvement in pain score	1566	1707	The between-group difference in change in pain, as measured by the McGill pain questionnaire, was −8.2 points (95% CI −16.1 to −0.3, P=0.04).
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Changes in electrochemical skin conductance in the foot	1401	1565	Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens (95% CI 1.2–23.6, P=0.03) with the intervention in an effect size analysis.
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Reduction in body weight after 20 weeks	15884	16030	Body weight declined by a mean of 7.0 kg over 20 weeks in the intervention group, as compared with 0.6 kg in the control group (P<0.001, Table 2).
Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement	Only vitamin B12 supplement	Reduction in body weight after 20 weeks	1251	1400	After 20 weeks, body weight change with the intervention was −6.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) −9.4 to −3.4, P<0.001) in an effect size analysis.
