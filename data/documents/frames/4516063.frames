All Bond 2 (Group III)	Group I, II and Group III (positive control)	bond strength values	8012	8224	Comparing the shear bond strength values of Group I, II and Group III (positive control), All Bond 2 (Group III) demonstrated fairly higher bond strength values at different levels of dentin (Graph 1) (P < 0.05).
All Bond 2 (Group III)	Group I, II and Group III (positive control)	bond strength values	839	1101	Comparing the shear bond strength values, All Bond 2 (Group III) demonstrated fairly higher bond strength values at different levels of dentin. Generally comparing All Bond 2 with the other two experimental groups revealed highly significant statistical results.
