Low molecular weight heparin 	Insulin	White blood cell count	8387	8508	whereas no significant differences were observed between groups B and C (P>0.05). The results are summarized in Table II.
Low molecular weight heparin	Control	Hemodiastase levels	8676	8792	At day 3, the hemodiastase levels of groups C and D were significantly lower compared with those in group A (P<0.05)
Low molecular weight heparin + Insulin	Control	White blood cell count	1217	1395	IIT + LMWH noticeably increased the white blood cell count, hemodiastase level, serum albumin level and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen in the patients with SAP (P<0.05).
Low molecular weight heparin	Control	White blood cell count	8133	8254	At day 3, the white blood cell counts in groups C and D were significantly lower compared with those in group A (P<0.05).
Low molecular weight heparin 	Insulin	Hemodiastase levels	8939	9061	whereas no significant differences were observed between groups B and C (P>0.05). The results are summarized in Table III.
Low molecular weight heparin 	Insulin	White blood cell count	8395	8467	no significant differences were observed between groups B and C (P>0.05)
