Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	mean number of QALYs after 9 months	18260	18548	The mean number of QALYs after 9 months was 0.56 (SE 0.02) in the PST group and 0.50 (SE 0.02) in the UC group. After correction for baseline utility, the difference in QALYs between PST and UC was in favour of the PST group (0.03), but statistically non-significant (95% CI −0.02; 0.08).
Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	Total mental health care costs	19962	20170	Total mental health care costs were €485 in the PST group and €259 in the UC group. Although this difference was considerable, it did not reach statistical significance (mean difference €226, 95% CI -3; 448).
Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	Total mental health care costs	1344	1511	Mean total costs were €4795 in the PST group and €6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359).
Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	improvement in HADS score	16826	17080	improvement in HADS score was −3.1 (SE 1.3) in PST patients and −2.9 (SE 1.0) in UC patients indicating that PST patients improved more than UC patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant (mean difference −0.2, 95% CI −3.7; 3.2).
Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	clinical outcomes at 9 months	1258	1343	There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months.
Problem-Solving Treatment (PST)	usual care (UC)	improvement in HADS score	16783	17080	After 9 months the multiply imputed pooled improvement in HADS score was −3.1 (SE 1.3) in PST patients and −2.9 (SE 1.0) in UC patients indicating that PST patients improved more than UC patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant (mean difference −0.2, 95% CI −3.7; 3.2).
