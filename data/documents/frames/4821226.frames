core decompression with the application of bone marrow aspirate concentrate	core decompression only	the head survival rate	11069	11379	Over the period of two years there was no significant difference between the head survival rate of 8/14 (57%) in the control group, and 7/11 (64%) in the verum group. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the interval between core decompression with or without BMAC application and THA.
core decompression with the application of bone marrow aspirate concentrate	core decompression only	femoral head necrosis (FHN)	10603	10870	n contrast to the clinical outcome, we could not perceive any significant change in the volume of FHN in both treatment groups related to the longitudinal course after treating (Figure 3). Again no statistically significant difference was detected between the groups.
