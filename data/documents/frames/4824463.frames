Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Rates of mortality	28015	28163	There were 21 (1.4%) deaths in the CJ arm compared with 15(1.0%) deaths in the RDT-arm. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31).
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of moderate or severe anaemia after the first episode of fever	1305	1533	. After the first episode of febrile illness, the incidence of severe anaemia was the same in both arms (0.11 per child per year) and that of moderate anaemia was 0.16 (0.13–0.21) vs. 0.17 (0.14–0.21) per child year respectively
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of moderate or severe anaemia after the first episode of fever	1307	1534	After the first episode of febrile illness, the incidence of severe anaemia was the same in both arms (0.11 per child per year) and that of moderate anaemia was 0.16 (0.13–0.21) vs. 0.17 (0.14–0.21) per child year respectively.
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of severe febrile illness per child and year	27104	27292	The incidence of severe febrile illness after a first episode was 0.15 (0.09–0.24) per child per year in the RDT arm compared with 0.17 (0.11–0.28) among children in the CJ arm (p = 0.78).
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of severe febrile illness per child and year	1535	1674	The incidence of severe febrile illness was 0.15 (0.09, 0.24) in the RDT arm compared to 0.17 (0.11, 0.28) per child per year respectively.
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Proportion of patients with fever receiving ACT	1675	1767	The proportion of fever cases receiving ACT was lower in the RDT arm (72% vs 81%; p = 0.02).
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of the overall episodes of malaria	1087	1306	the incidence of all episodes of malaria following the first febrile illness was 0.64 (95% CI 0.49–0.82) and 0.76 (0.63–0.93) per child per year in the RDT and CJ arms respectively (adjusted rate ratio 1.13 (0.82–1.55).
Rapid diagnostic tests	Clinical judgement	Incidence of the overall episodes of malaria	24648	25005	The incidence of all episodes (first or repeat) of malaria was 0.99 per child per year (95% CI 0.78, 1.27) in the RDT arm compared to 1.05 per child per year (95% CI 0.87, 1.29) in the CJ arm. There was no significant difference in the incidence of all episodes of malaria following the first episode of febrile illness (adjusted rate Ratio 1.13, 0.82–1.55)
