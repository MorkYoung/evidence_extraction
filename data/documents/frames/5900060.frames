noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	no NIV	Survival from NIV months	737	896	The NIV group presented longer survival (median 18.50 months, 95% CI 12.62–24.38 months) than the no-NIV group (3.00 months, 95% CI 0.82–5.18 months) (p<0.001)
noninvasive ventilation (NIV)	no NIV	Survival from NIV months	18463	18930	When patients were compared in terms of site of ALS onset, all patients who agreed to receive NIV presented longer survival from NIV than those who refused NIV: spinal onset and NIV, median 24.00 months (95% CI 17.03–30.96 months); spinal onset without NIV, median 2.00 months (95% CI 0.23–3.76 months) (p=0.001); bulbar onset and NIV, median 12.00 months (95% CI 9.60 to 14.40 months); bulbar onset without NIV, median 4.00 months (95%CI 2.04–5.95 months) (p<0.001).
