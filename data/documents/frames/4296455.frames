preoperative oral sedation (diazepam)	without it	mean number of pulse oximetry alarms	10283	10482	The mean value shows about eight fold increased alarms in control group compared to experimental group. However no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (P = 0.683).
preoperative oral sedation (diazepam)	without it	Number of times oxygen saturation fell	10135	10482	Number of times oxygen saturation fell below 95%, in each patient in experimental and control group was subjected to Mannâ€“Whitney U-test [Table 1]. The mean value shows about eight fold increased alarms in control group compared to experimental group. However no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (P = 0.683).
preoperative oral sedation (diazepam)	without it	mean number of pulse oximetry alarms	10484	10854	We analyzed mean number of pulse oximetry alarms per time interval [Table 2]. We found increased tendency of hypoxia during 3rd and 4th time interval in both experimental and control groups, which is least in the last time interval corresponding to the termination of surgery. Howewer No statistically significant differences were found with Chi-square test (P = 0.979).
preoperative oral sedation (diazepam)	without it	mean number of pulse oximetry alarms	10562	10854	We found increased tendency of hypoxia during 3rd and 4th time interval in both experimental and control groups, which is least in the last time interval corresponding to the termination of surgery. Howewer No statistically significant differences were found with Chi-square test (P = 0.979).
