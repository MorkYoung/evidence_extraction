fixed-combination brinzolamide/brimonidine (BBFC) adjunctive to a prostaglandin analog (PGA)	vehicle adjunctive treatment and prostaglandin analog (PGA)	diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP)	1264	1470	At week 6, mean diurnal IOP with BBFC+PGA was lower than with vehicle+PGA (17.1±0.4 mm Hg vs 20.5±0.4 mm Hg; between-group difference, −3.4±0.5 mm Hg; P<0.0001; 95% confidence interval, −4.5 to −2.4 mm Hg).
fixed-combination brinzolamide/brimonidine (BBFC) adjunctive to a prostaglandin analog (PGA)	vehicle adjunctive treatment and prostaglandin analog (PGA)	Mean diurnal IOP change	15772	16021	Mean diurnal IOP change from PGA-treated baseline was significantly greater with BBFC+PGA (−5.7±0.3 mm Hg) compared with vehicle+PGA (−1.9±0.3 mm Hg). The between-group difference was −3.7±0.4 mm Hg (P<0.0001; 95% CI, −4.5 to −2.9 mm Hg; Figure 3a).
fixed-combination brinzolamide/brimonidine (BBFC) adjunctive to a prostaglandin analog (PGA)	vehicle adjunctive treatment and prostaglandin analog (PGA)	diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP)	15183	15425	Least squares mean±SE diurnal IOP was 17.1±0.4 mm Hg with BBFC+PGA (95% CI, 16.3–17.8 mm Hg) vs 20.5±0.4 mm Hg with vehicle+PGA (95% CI, 19.8–21.2 mm Hg). The between-group difference was −3.4±0.5 mm Hg (P<0.0001; 95% CI, −4.5 to −2.4 mm Hg);
