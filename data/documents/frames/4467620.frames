Hot + Cooling conditions	Hot conditions	decrease in exercise intensity as time elapsed	14676	14813	These results indicate that exercise intensity decreased as time elapsed and the degree of decrease was not different between conditions.
Exercise - Hot condition	At rest - Hot condition	accuracy of the cognitive tasks	1643	1773	The accuracy of the cognitive tasks was lower during exercise than that at rest in the Hot and Hot + Cooling condition (p < 0.05).
Exercise - Hot + Cooling conditions	At rest - Hot + Cooling conditions	accuracy of the cognitive tasks	1643	1773	The accuracy of the cognitive tasks was lower during exercise than that at rest in the Hot and Hot + Cooling condition (p < 0.05).
Hot + Cooling conditions	Hot conditions	differences in the accuracy	1774	1871	There were no differences in the accuracy between the Hot and Hot + Cooling conditions (p = 0.98)
Hot + Cooling conditions	Hot conditions	weight reduction	16179	16328	we observed no difference in weight reduction between conditions (0.41 ± 0.07% in the Hot condition and 0.37 ± 0.22% in the Hot + Cooling condition).
