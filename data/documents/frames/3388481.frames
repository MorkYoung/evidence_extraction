Hypnosis and Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)	Standard medical care alone	Success of external cephalic version (ECV) procedure	1117	1278	In the control group (n = 122) 27.3% (n = 33) had a statistically significant lower successful ECV procedure than NLP (P = 0.05) and hypnosis and NLP (P = 0.03).
Hypnosis	Standard medical care alone	Success of external cephalic version (ECV) procedure	10230	10486	Statistically improved success rates were seen when comparing NLP (P = 0.05) or hypnosis and NLP together (P = 0.03) with the control group (Table 3); however, hypnosis only had a trend to higher success rates when compared to the control group (P = 0.08).
Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) and Hypnosis	Standard medical care alone	Baseline characteristics	9642	9882	Baseline characteristics (size, weight before pregnancy, current weight, gestation age, amniotic fluid index, fetal weight estimation, parity, and breech firmly fixed in the pelvis) were similar in the two groups (P > 0.05; Tables 1 and 2).

Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)	Standard medical care alone	Success of external cephalic version (ECV) procedure	10230	10380	Statistically improved success rates were seen when comparing NLP (P = 0.05) or hypnosis and NLP together (P = 0.03) with the control group (Table 3);
Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)	Standard medical care alone	Success of external cephalic version (ECV) procedure	1117	1450	In the control group (n = 122) 27.3% (n = 33) had a statistically significant lower successful ECV procedure than NLP (P = 0.05) and hypnosis and NLP (P = 0.03).  <NEWLINE>Conclusions. These findings suggest that prior clinical hypnosis and NLP have similar success rates of ECV procedures and are both superior to standard medical care alone
