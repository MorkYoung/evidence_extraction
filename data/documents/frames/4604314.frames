Sodium nitrate supplementation in normoxia 	Control	Right ventricle to right atrium pressure gradient	1176	1325	During steady state exercise, hypoxia elevated RV-RA gradient (p > 0.05), while oral nitrate supplementation did not alter RV-RA gradient (p > 0.05).
Sodium nitrate supplementation in hypoxia 	Control	Time to completing trial cycling	1504	1661	Hypoxia impaired time-to-completion during TT (p < 0.05), while no improvements were observed with nitrate supplementation in normoxia or hypoxia (p > 0.05).

Sodium nitrate supplementation in hypoxia 	Control	Muscle tissue oxygenation	1397	1503	Nitrate supplementation further decreased muscle tissue oxygenation during 15 km TT in hypoxia (p < 0.05).
