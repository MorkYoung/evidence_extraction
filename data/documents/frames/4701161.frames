VARA	baseline	Raldh-1 > Raldh-3 > Raldh-2. Raldh-1 expression	21175	21283	VARA supplementation altered expression only in adults, in which expression was reduced (Fig 4A; blue bars).
VARA	baseline	Lrat expression	19602	19702	After VARA supplementation, Lrat expression increased significantly at each age (Fig 3B; blue bars).
VARA	baseline	Stra6 expression	19169	19362	After VARA supplementation, Stra6 expression increased significantly at each age (Fig 3A; blue bars); however, the magnitude of increase decreased negative trend with age (P < 0.0001 for VARA).
VARA	baseline	Stra6 expression	1206	1567	ARA supplementation increased total retinol in plasma, liver and lung, with a dose-by-dose accumulation in neonatal liver and lung, while transcripts for Lrat in liver, megalin in kidney, Cyp26A1/B1 in liver and lung, respectively, and Stra6 in lung, were all increased, suggesting pathways of VA uptake, storage and RA oxidation were each augmented after VARA.
VARA	baseline	megalin mRNA in adults	1205	1734	VARA supplementation increased total retinol in plasma, liver and lung, with a dose-by-dose accumulation in neonatal liver and lung, while transcripts for Lrat in liver, megalin in kidney, Cyp26A1/B1 in liver and lung, respectively, and Stra6 in lung, were all increased, suggesting pathways of VA uptake, storage and RA oxidation were each augmented after VARA. VARA decreased hepatic expression of Rbp4, responsible for VA trafficking from liver to plasma, and, in lung, of Raldh-1 and Raldh-2, which function in RA production.
placebo	baseline	Raldh-1 > Raldh-3 > Raldh-2. Raldh-1 expression	20905	21174	Based on cycle threshold numbers, the relative expression levels among these three genes were Raldh-1 > Raldh-3 > Raldh-2. Raldh-1 expression displayed an age-related increase (P < 0.001) in the control group, driven by higher expression in adults (Fig 4A; black bars).
