insulin (detemir)	control	Self-measured plasma glucose levels	14848	15014	Self-measured plasma glucose levels decreased in both groups, with significantly greater reductions in postprandial values in the insulin detemir versus control group
insulin (detemir)	control	Self-measured plasma glucose levels	14848	15025	Self-measured plasma glucose levels decreased in both groups, with significantly greater reductions in postprandial values in the insulin detemir versus control group (Fig. 2D).
insulin (detemir)	control	mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG)	13571	13717	Accordingly, mean FPG decreased more in the detemir (−2.1 mmol/L) than control group (−0.4 mmol/L; ETD −1.7 [−2.2 to −1.3]; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C).
