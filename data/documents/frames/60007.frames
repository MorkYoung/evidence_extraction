mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	maximal T block	1288	1403	Mivacurium 250 μg/kg produced a maximal T block faster than 200 μg/kg, i.e. 2.4 ± 1.1 vs. 3.5 ± 1.4 min (p < 0.05).
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	heart rate (HR)	1460	1496	Heart rate was similar between doses
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)	18320	18515	In relation to the cardiovascular response, the AUC-HR was similar in the two groups (p > 0.05) while both AUC-SBP and AUC-DBP were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in patients receiving 250 μg/kg.
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	Spontaneous recovery time	1404	1458	Spontaneous recovery times were similar in both groups
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	Spontaneous recovery time	16434	16758	The times to OA and to spontaneous recovery of T and T4/T1 of the two groups were summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. In relation to T response (Table 2), the maximal block with mivacurium 250 μg/kg appeared one minute faster than 200 μg/kg (p < 0.05), whereas spontaneous recovery times were similar between groups.
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	heart rate (HR)	18320	18415	In relation to the cardiovascular response, the AUC-HR was similar in the two groups (p > 0.05)
mivacurium 250 μg/kg	mivacurium 200 μg/kg	systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)	18416	18515	while both AUC-SBP and AUC-DBP were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in patients receiving 250 μg/kg.
