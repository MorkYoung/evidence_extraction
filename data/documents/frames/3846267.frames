Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity at the third phase of treatment	9428	9776	In the third phase of treatment of topical MMC only 7 patients (28%) had involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity and this is less than 25% involvement but the percentage of patients in acetic acid group that involved in more than 25% mastoid involvement was 17 patients (68%), which was again statistically signi- ficant (P<0.05).
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Baseline characteristics	7981	8360	The number of men and women in both groups were similar. The time period, the long-lasting Otorrhea and the degree of involvement of disease were similar in both groups. All patients had involvement of the middle ear and mastoid and 4 patients in each group had advanced cholesteatoma involvement with extensive and multiple anatomic structures beyond the middle ear and mastoid.
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Dry cavity after 1 month of treatment	8897	9053	But one month later, this percentage (complete dry mastoid) in the MMC group was 72% and for Acid group was 20% that was statistically significant (P<0.05).
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Dry cavity after 1 month of treatment	8901	9053	one month later, this percentage (complete dry mastoid) in the MMC group was 72% and for Acid group was 20% that was statistically significant (P<0.05).
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Dry cavity after 3 months of treatment	9778	10038	After three months of follow up, the final result of using topical MMC and acetic acid was evaluated and the incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue was 92% in MMC group whereas it was 24% in Acid group, which was statistically significant (P<0.05).
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Baseline characteristics	7981	8150	The number of men and women in both groups were similar. The time period, the long-lasting Otorrhea and the degree of involvement of disease were similar in both groups.
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Patients with 25% involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity after three months	9778	10265	After three months of follow up, the final result of using topical MMC and acetic acid was evaluated and the incidence of dry cavity with no granulation tissue was 92% in MMC group whereas it was 24% in Acid group, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). At the same time the percentage of patients with 25% involvement mastoid cavity with granulation was 8% in the MMC group (two patients) and 19 patients (76%) in Acid group, which was again statistically significant difference.
Mitomycine C	Acetic acid	Patients with 25% involvement with granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity after three months	10039	10265	At the same time the percentage of patients with 25% involvement mastoid cavity with granulation was 8% in the MMC group (two patients) and 19 patients (76%) in Acid group, which was again statistically significant difference.
