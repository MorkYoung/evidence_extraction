Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Diastolic blood pressure	10827	11120	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Arterial O2	10827	11120	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Diastolic blood pressure	10827	11163	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction as well as within post ICU hospitalization
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Heart rate 	10827	11164	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction as well as within post ICU hospitalization.
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Heart rate 	10827	11120	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Systolic blood pressure	-1	-1	Repeated measure analysis showed the same changes between the two groups regarding the trend of Systolic BP (F (1.330) = 0.162, P = 0.688);
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Systolic blood pressure	1515	1830	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups. These between-group differences in the studied indices remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction as well as post ICU hospitalization.
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Patient awareness 	1380	1514	The overall incidence of awareness in the BIS and routine monitoring groups were 5.5% and 4.1%, which was not significantly different.
Bispectral monitoring 	Control	Arterial O2	10827	11164	There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices including SBP, DBP, HR, and SPO2 before induction of anesthesia between the two groups (Table 2). These between-group differences in the studied indices were remained insignificant at different time points after anesthesia induction as well as within post ICU hospitalization.
