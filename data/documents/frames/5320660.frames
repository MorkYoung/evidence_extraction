muffins enriched with 30 g HAM-RS2	muffins enriched with 0 g HAM-RS2 (control)	body composition	18379	18456	Consuming muffins with HAM-RS2 did not significantly change body composition.
muffins enriched with 30 g HAM-RS2	muffins enriched with 0 g HAM-RS2 (control)	peptide YY [PYY]	-1	-1	Only one biomarker differed between groups when examining single blood collection time points. The 120 min postprandial concentration of PYY (P = 0.043) was higher in the HAM-RS2 group than the control group at baseline. Within-group differences in leptin and PYY were found from baseline to week 6 in the HAM-RS2 group. A decrease in postprandial leptin (P = 0.028) occurred at 120 min in the HAM-RS2 group. A within-group change in PYY was also observed in the HAM-RS2 group where fasting concentrations increased (P = 0.033) from baseline to the end of the intervention.
muffins enriched with 30 g HAM-RS2	muffins enriched with 0 g HAM-RS2 (control)	Mean overall satiety score	18084	18163	Mean overall satiety score did not differ within or between groups (P = 0.230).
muffins enriched with 30 g HAM-RS2	muffins enriched with 0 g HAM-RS2 (control)	peptide YY [PYY]	1288	1455	At baseline, total PYY concentrations were significantly higher 120 min following the consumption of study muffins in the HAM-RS2 group than control group (P = 0.043).
muffins enriched with 30 g HAM-RS2	muffins enriched with 0 g HAM-RS2 (control)	body composition	2204	2445	Consuming 30 g HAM-RS2 daily for 6 weeks can improve glucose homeostasis, lower leptin concentrations, and increase fasting PYY in healthy overweight adults without impacting body composition and may aid in the prevention of chronic disease.
