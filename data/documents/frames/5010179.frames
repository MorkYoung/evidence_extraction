Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Overall survival	17546	17732	The OS rates at 5 years were similar between the UFT/LV and surgery alone groups (66.1% vs. 66.8%, Fig 2-B) with the hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.48–1.35; P = 0.409).
Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Resection rates	18555	18656	The resection rates for the first recurrence were similar between the UFT/LV and surgery alone groups
Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Recurrence-free survival	1347	1491	UFT/LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.83; P = 0.003)
Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Resection rates	18555	18675	The resection rates for the first recurrence were similar between the UFT/LV and surgery alone groups (55.9% vs. 41.0%).
Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Recurrence-free survival	-1	-1	The recurrence-free survival curves of the UFT/LV group (red line) and surgery alone group (black line) group are shown. The 3-year recurrence-free rate was significantly higher in the UFT/LV group than in the surgery alone group (38.6% vs. 32.3%, P = 0.003).
Uracil-tegafur and leucovorin	Control	Overall survival	-1	-1	The 5-year overall survival rates of the two groups were similar (66.1% vs. 66.8%, P = 0.409).
