3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream)	50?g OGTT (A)	insulin excursions 	15125	15289	All three commercial breakfasts showed somewhat smaller insulin excursions with respect to the one elicited by glucose administration (Figure 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)).
B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream	50?g OGTT (A)	P300 latency incremental values	-1	-1	The repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction was significant (p < 0.01) and the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test showed that the only significant difference among means was the one between breakfast B3 and glucose (?33.6?±?5.9?ms versus 9.7?±?6.6?ms, p < 0.01).
3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream)	50?g OGTT (A)	glucose incremental peaks	14131	14638	As for the comparison among the incremental peak values of glycemia (Figure 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c)), the repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction resulted significant (p < 0.001) and the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test revealed that B1 (36.2 ± 3.8 mg/dL), B2 (19.6 ± 2.9 mg/dL), and B3 (27.3 ± 4.0 mg/dL) had significantly smaller glucose incremental peaks than A (55.9 ± 6.1 mg/dL) with p values associated to such post hoc comparisons that were p = 0.04, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively.
B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream	50?g OGTT (A)	P300 latency incremental values	1188	1391	P300 latency tended to decrease following each of the three breakfasts, but B3 was the only breakfast capable to elicit a statistically significant reduction in P300 latency with respect to A (p < 0.01),
3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream)	50?g OGTT (A)	glucose incremental peaks	-1	-1	the repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction resulted significant (p < 0.001) and the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test revealed that B1 (36.2?±?3.8?mg/dL), B2 (19.6?±?2.9?mg/dL), and B3 (27.3?±?4.0?mg/dL) had significantly smaller glucose incremental peaks than A (55.9?±?6.1?mg/dL) with p values associated to such post hoc comparisons that were p = 0.04, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively.
3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream)	50?g OGTT (A)	insulin excursions 	15125	15607	All three commercial breakfasts showed somewhat smaller insulin excursions with respect to the one elicited by glucose administration (Figure 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)). As for the comparison among the insulinemic AUC values (Figure 2(d)), the repeated measures ANOVA was significant (p < 0.001) (without requiring any correction for the sphericity condition) and the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test showed that both B1 and B2 had smaller insulin AUCs than A (p = 0.002 and p = 0.016, resp.).
