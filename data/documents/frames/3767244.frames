Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Trunk fat if +20% body fat	981	1198	Those in the EX below median body fat (20%) increased LTM (P = 0.014) only, while those above 20% decreased fat mass (P = 0.02), total fat (N = 0.009), and trunk fat (P = 0.001), while also increasing LTM (P = 0.027).
Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Total fat if +20% body fat	24350	24489	Further, the +20 group decreased total fat mass (P = .02), percentage of total body fat (P = .009), and percentage of trunk fat (P = .001).
Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Lean tissue mass	881	980	The EX had a significant increase in lean tissue mass (LTM) (P < 0.001) following the intervention.

Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Salivary cortisol 1 hour after waking	23166	23346	There was a decrease in salivary cortisol at wake in the exercise group following the intervention, and there was a trend for a decrease one hour after waking in the exercise group
Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Fat mass if +20% body fat	981	1198	Those in the EX below median body fat (20%) increased LTM (P = 0.014) only, while those above 20% decreased fat mass (P = 0.02), total fat (N = 0.009), and trunk fat (P = 0.001), while also increasing LTM (P = 0.027).
Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Salivary cortisol at wake	750	880	There was a decrease in salivary cortisol at wake (P = 0.025) in the EX and a trend (P = 0.07) for a decrease 1 hour after waking.
Moderate-intensity exercise training	Control	Salivary cortisol 1 hour after waking	750	880	There was a decrease in salivary cortisol at wake (P = 0.025) in the EX and a trend (P = 0.07) for a decrease 1 hour after waking.
