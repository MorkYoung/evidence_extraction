Elevation Training Masks© (ETM) , 	without the mask	forced vital capacity (FVC)	11133	11425	In addition, a 2×2 between groups ANOVA was utilized to look at the change between the control and experimental groups on FVC pre- to post-testing. There was not a significant difference in FVC between groups (F(1, 17)= 3.562, p = 0.079, partial ETA squared= .192) (see Figure 3 and Table 1).
Elevation Training Masks© (ETM) , without the mask	baseline	Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)	1159	1252	Within subjects, there was a significant increase in predicted VO2max (F(1,17)=7.376, P<.05).
Elevation Training Masks© (ETM)	without the mask	forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC)	1389	1558	Forced inspiratory vital capacity demonstrated no significant difference within subjects (F(1, 17)= .073, p > .05), or between the two groups (F(1, 17)= 3.724, p= .073).
Elevation Training Masks© (ETM)	without the mask	forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC)	10856	11131	A 2×2 between groups ANOVA was also used to look at the pre- to post-testing values of FIVC between the control and experimental groups. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (F(1, 17)= 3.724, p= .073, partial ETA squared= .199) (see Figure 2 and Table 1).
Elevation Training Masks© (ETM) , 	without the mask	forced vital capacity (FVC)	1559	1797	Similar to the VO2max results, forced vital capacity demonstrated a significant increase within subjects (F(1, 17)=6.201, p<.05), but there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups (F(1,17)=3.562, p= .079)
