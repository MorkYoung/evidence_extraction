ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT)	double-dose statin (DST) 	Small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sd-LDL-C) level at 52wks	1167	1266	The reduction of LDL-C was larger in the EAT group (28.3%) than in the DST group (9.2%) at 52 weeks
ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT)	double-dose statin (DST) 	Small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sd-LDL-C) level at 52wks	17800	18013	This sd-LDL outcome (36.1 ± 14.9 mg/dl at 52 weeks) was significantly lower than those in the DST Group (45.6 ± 13.4 mg/dl at 52wk). The sd-LDL-C level at 52wks were significantly different (p = 0.0035). (Fig. 3C)
