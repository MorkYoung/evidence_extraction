belatacept groups	tacrolimus groups	The proportion of patients who met the primary end point (composite of acute rejection, graft loss, death by month 6)	497	831	. Demographic characteristics were similar among groups. The proportion of patients who met the primary end point (composite of acute rejection, graft loss, death by month 6) was higher in the belatacept groups (42–48%) versus tacrolimus groups (15–38%), with the highest number of deaths and grafts losses in the belatacept LD group.
