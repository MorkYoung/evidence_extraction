T1 noise exposure (0–5 years of exposure)	T3 noise exposure (>10 years of exposure)	latency	12817	13033	post hoc least significant difference (LSD) was done to look for pair-wise comparisons for the same parameters. It revealed a progressive increase in terms of latency and decrease in terms of amplitude from T1 to T3.
