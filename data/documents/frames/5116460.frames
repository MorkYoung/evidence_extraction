memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	Gray volume changes in bilateral hippocampus in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)	17270	17720	We examined gray-matter volume changes after yoga and memory training in bilateral hippocampus and dACC (Table 2 and Figure 1). An effect size (between group Cohen's d) for gray-matter volume changes (see Table 2) was also calculated. Analyses for the hippocampus did not reveal a significant interaction term between time and group (F(1,23) = 1.35, p = 0.25) indicating that change in hippocampal volume did not differ between the two interventions.
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	hippocampal choline at baseline	19232	19349	hippocampal choline was greater in the memory training group at baseline than the yoga group (t(38) = 2.17, p = 0.04)
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	Gray matter volume dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)	17721	17973	In dACC, there was a significant interaction term (F(1,22) = 4.86, p = 0.04); the memory training group showed a trend towards increased volume after training (t(22) = 1.73, p = 0.1) while the yoga group did not show any change (t(22) = 1.38, p = 0.2).
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	Gray volume changes in bilateral hippocampus in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)	17646	17719	change in hippocampal volume did not differ between the two interventions
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	Gray matter volume dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)	17974	18057	Further, there were no significant main effects of group or time for either region.
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	choline	18993	19157	Post hoc analyses showed that choline decreased in the memory training group (t(38) = âˆ’2.58, p = 0.01), but did not change in the yoga group (t(38) = 0.30, p = 0.8)
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	Gray matter volume dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)	1534	1695	Structural MRI analysis showed an interaction between time and group in dACC, indicating a trend towards increased gray matter volume after the MET intervention.
memory enhancement training (MET)	mind-body practice (yogic meditation)	hippocampal choline at baseline	19159	19350	Of note, though all other measures were similar across treatment groups, hippocampal choline was greater in the memory training group at baseline than the yoga group (t(38) = 2.17, p = 0.04).
