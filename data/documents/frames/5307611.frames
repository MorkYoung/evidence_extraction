Theory-based educational intervention	Control group	Mean scores of the constructs of the Protection Motivation Theory at baseline	10823	10989	Before the intervention, no significant difference in mean (SD) scores of the constructs of the Protection Motivation Theory was found between the two groups (p>0.05)
Theory-based educational intervention	Control group	SCPBs	12218	12453	The comparison of SCPBs (use of sunscreen or sun block lotion, long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and stay in shade) in the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention is presented in Tables 3 and 4 (p<0.05).
Theory-based educational intervention	Control group	Perceived susceptibility	14827	15123	The findings showed that perceived susceptibility in the intervention group increased significantly compared to the control group 3 months after the intervention, showing that the educational program has been effective on perceived susceptibility among the rural farmers in the intervention group
Theory-based educational intervention	Control group	SCPBs	21081	21251	It was concluded that designing an educational program with a focus on promoting perceived susceptibility increased the level of performing SCPBs among the rural farmers.
