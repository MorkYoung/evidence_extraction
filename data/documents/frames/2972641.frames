mesalamine at 2.4 g/day (pH-2.4 g)	mesalamine at 2.25 g/day	time to bloody stools	1121	1250	No statistically significant difference in time to bloody stools was found between the two formulations (P = 0.27, log-rank test)
mesalamine at 2.4 g/day (pH-2.4 g)	mesalamine at 2.25 g/day (Time-2.25 g)	safety profiles	1408	1489	No differences were observed between the safety profiles of the two formulations.
mesalamine at 2.4 g/day (pH-2.4 g)	mesalamine at 2.25 g/day (Time-2.25 g)	time to bloody stools	1121	1407	No statistically significant difference in time to bloody stools was found between the two formulations (P = 0.27, log-rank test), but the time to bloody stools tended to be longer in pH-2.4 g compared to Time-2.25 g, and a similar trend was observed with regard to the time to relapse.
