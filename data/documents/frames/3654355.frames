Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group	Waiting list control	Baseline eating behavior 	18504	18611	Group comparisons of scores on the TFEQ-R21 showed no differences in eating behavior at baseline (Table 7).
Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group	Waiting list control	Baseline characteristics, except age	16549	16776	Baseline characteristics of the participants who completed the study are shown in Table 1. The ILI-group was older than the control group, but no other significant differences between the two study groups were seen at baseline.
