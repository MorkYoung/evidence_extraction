echium oil (EO) 	linseed oil (LO)	eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma, Red Blood Cell Count (RBC), and PBMC (	Purified Blood Mononuclear Cells)	16724	16852	. Final EPA and DPA in plasma, RBC, and PBMC were consistently higher (15–35 %) compared to LO, respectively (P < 0.05; Table 4)
echium oil (EO) 	linseed oil (LO)	DHA	1756	1811	Following EO, final DHA was not greater compared to LO.
echium oil (EO) 	linseed oil (LO)	eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma, Red Blood Cell Count (RBC), and PBMC (	Purified Blood Mononuclear Cells)	16724	16853	. Final EPA and DPA in plasma, RBC, and PBMC were consistently higher (15–35 %) compared to LO, respectively (P < 0.05; Table 4).
echium oil (EO) 	linseed oil (LO)	insulin concentration in serum	19708	19824	The insulin concentration in serum decreased most with EO vs. LO (P < 0.001), while OO remained unchanged (Table 5).
fish oil (FO)	linseed oil (LO), echium oil (EO), olive oil (OO)	RBC, and PBMC of EPA	17592	17836	Overall, final EPA and DPA in plasma, RBC and PBMC were in similar order: FO > EO > LO > OO (P ≤ 0.001; not for DPA in RBC; Table 4). In plasma and PBMC, DHA was highest following FO, but was not different in RBC compared to EO or LO (Table 4).
