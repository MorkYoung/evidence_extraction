question: 100 patients taking one kind of medicine, 70 patients became better. How would you evaluate the drug effect?	question: 100 patients taking one kind of medicine, 30 patients didn't become better. How would you evaluate the drug effect?	positive evaluation	1140	1419	If the drug effect was described as "of 100 patients taking this kind of medicine, 70 patients became better", people tended to make more positive evaluations, compared with described as "of 100 patients taking this kind of medicine, 30 patients didn't become better" (P < 0.01).
Eye surgery may lead to two potential sequelas: one is a minor decline of visual acuity and the other is keratitis. Imagine you will take this kind of surgery and two doctors' medical records revealed that: Doctor A: Of 200 patients, 191 were not found postoperative visual acuity declined but 3 suffered from keratitis; Doctor B: Of 200 patients, 198 were not found postoperative visual acuity declined but 10 suffered from keratitis. Which doctor you will choose?	Eye surgery may lead to two potential sequelas: one is a minor decline of visual acuity and the other is keratitis. Imagine you will take this kind of surgery and two doctors' medical records revealed that: Doctor A: Of 200 patients, 197 didn't suffer from keratitis but 9 were found visual acuity declined. Doctor B: Of 200 patients, 190 didn't suffer from keratitis but 2 were found visual acuity declined. Which doctor you will choose?	number size framing effect	10306	10475	Table 5 described the effect of number size framing. The results revealed that the number size framing effect was significant in medical situation (t = -7.5, P < 0.001).
question: Doctor tells you that although you particularly like to eat bacon, if you stop eating, your body cholesterol content would be significantly reduced, and thus the possibility of suffering from cardiovascular disease would be greatly reduced. Would you continue to eat bacon?	question: Doctors tells you that although you particularly like to eat bacon, if you continue to eat, your body cholesterol content will significantly rise, and thus the possibility of suffering from cardiovascular disease would be greatly increased. Would you continue to eat bacon?	better compliance	9496	9696	As shown in Table 2 that if the doctor' advise was respectively described in the benefit of compliance and the aftermath of violation, the former one lead to a better compliance (t = 2.14, P = 0.035).
There are 600 critically ill patients in one hospital. Two rescue programs are under consideration. If program A is adopted, 200 patients will be saved; If program B is adopted, there is a 1\3 chance that all patients will be saved and there is 2/3 chance that none will be saved. Which program will you choose?	There are 600 critically ill patients in one hospital. Two rescue programs are under consideration. If program A is adopted, 400 patients will die; If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 chance that none of the patients will die and there is 2/3 chance that all will die Which program will you choose?	risk seeking	9698	10021	Table 3 presented the classic Asia Disease Problem which we used as an example of risky choice framing of options equivalent. The results revealed that in a positive frame, people tend to be risk seeking, while in a negative frame, people tend to be risk avoiding. The framing effect was significant (t = -2.72, P = 0.007).

How would you evaluate the drug effect?	positive evaluation	9268	9495	As shown in Table 1, the results revealed that if drug effect was described respectively in a therapeutically effective rate or ineffective rate, the participants gave the former a more positive evaluation (t = 3.34, P = 0.01).
Imagine one of your relatives was diagnosed with a cancer that must be treated. His choices are as follows: Surgery: Of 100 people having surgery, 50 live through the operation, and 40 are alive at the end of five years. Radiation therapy: Of 100 people having radiation therapy, all live through the treatment, and 20 are alive at the end of five years. Which treatment would you advise him to choose?	Imagine one of your relatives was diagnosed with a cancer that must be treated. His choices are as follows: Surgery: Of 100 people having surgery, 50 die because of the operation and 10 of the 50 survivals die by the end of five years. Radiation therapy: Of 100 people having radiation therapy, none die during the treatment, and 80 die by the end of five years. Which treatment would you advise him to choose?	preferred the risky option	10022	10305	Table 4 described the risky choice framing effect when the candidate options were not equivalent. As the results revealed, if treatment options were described in survival rates, people more preferred the risky option, compared with described in mortality rates (t = 2.09, P = 0.039).
