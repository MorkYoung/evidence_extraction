intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	intubation time in hypertensive patients	952	1128	The intubation time was shorter in the conventional laryngoscopy group than in the intubating laryngeal mask airway group (16.33±10.8 vs. 43.04±19.8 s, respectively) (p<0.001).
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	Diastolic BP (DPB) measurements in hypertensive patients	1129	1324	The systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the intubating laryngeal mask airway group were higher than those in the conventional laryngoscopy group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (p<0.05)
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA)	conventional laryngoscopy (CL) 	SpO2 values	16402	16480	There were no differences in SpO2 values between the groups at any time point.
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	Systolic BP (SPB) measurements in hypertensive patients	1129	1325	The systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the intubating laryngeal mask airway group were higher than those in the conventional laryngoscopy group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (p<0.05).
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA)	conventional laryngoscopy (CL) 	SpO2 values	16402	16479	There were no differences in SpO2 values between the groups at any time point
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	Systolic BP (SPB) measurements in hypertensive patients	15994	16121	SBP measurements in the ILMA group were significantly higher than for the CL group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (p<0.05)
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	Diastolic BP (DPB) measurements in hypertensive patients	16123	16280	DBP measurements in the ILMA group were also significantly higher than in the CL group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively).
intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) 	conventional laryngoscopy (CL)	RPP (rate pressure product) values	16282	16401	The RPP values in the ILMA group were greater than those for the CL group at 1 and 2 min following intubation (p<0.05).
