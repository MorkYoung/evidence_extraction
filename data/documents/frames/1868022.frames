Pap smear at enrollment	No intervention at enrollment	Total protein concentrations in cervicovaginal lavages	12446	12705	Total protein in CVLs was determined at baseline (+3 days post-menses) and at follow-up (14 days later or +17 days post-menses) (Figure 1A). No significant difference in total protein concentrations in CVLs was observed within or between randomization groups.
Pap smear at enrollment	No intervention at enrollment	Levels of IL-12 p70 and TNF-α	1552	1666	markers of cell mediated immunity (IL-12 p70 and TNF-α) and T cell regulation (IL-10) were significantly elevated.
Pap smear at enrollment	No intervention at enrollment	Baseline characteristics	10332	10596	no significant differences were observed between these groups at baseline or at follow-up (in terms of any vaginal intercourse, number of acts of vaginal intercourse, condom use and use of any vaginal medications during the study follow-up period, data not shown).
Pap smear at enrollment	No intervention at enrollment	Cervicovaginal lavages levels of IL-8, IL-1β and IL-6	12794	13344	CVLs from each participant were investigated for the presence of cervical inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12 p70 and IL-10) at baseline and follow-up (Figure 1; see also Additional file 1 and 2). We found that levels of IL-1β (Figure 1B), IL-8 (Figure 1C), and IL-6 (Figure 1D) did not differ significantly between baseline and follow-up in either the control group (left panels) or the intervention group (right panels) indicating that a Pap smear was not detectably associated with increases in these proinflammatory cytokines.
Pap smear at enrollment	No intervention at enrollment	Levels of IL-12 p70 and TNF-α	1469	1666	While CVL levels of IL-8, IL-1β and IL-6 remained unchanged following a Pap smear, markers of cell mediated immunity (IL-12 p70 and TNF-α) and T cell regulation (IL-10) were significantly elevated.
