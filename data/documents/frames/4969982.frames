Esmolol	Control	Portal lactate	-1	-1	both DEX and ESM groups presented significant lower portal lactate values at points C and D as compared to LPS controls
Esmolol	Control	Portal lactate	-1	-1	Portal lactate levels increased over time in all animals, but both DEX and ESM groups presented significant lower portal lactate values at points C and D as compared to LPS controls (Table 4).
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Exogenous lactate clearance 	1736	1831	Exogenous lactate clearance was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine and esmolol groups.
Esmolol 	Control	Exogenous lactate clearance 	1736	1830	Exogenous lactate clearance was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine and esmolol groups
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Muscle lactate production	15918	15989	No difference in muscle lactate production between groups was observed.
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Portal lactate	-1	-1	both DEX and ESM groups presented significant lower portal lactate values at points C and D as compared to LPS controls
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Exogenous lactate clearance 	1736	1830	Exogenous lactate clearance was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine and esmolol groups
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Muscle lactate production	1489	1586	The dexmedetomidine group exhibited lower epinephrine levels, but no difference in muscle lactate
Dexmedetomidine	Control	Portal lactate	-1	-1	both DEX and ESM groups presented significant lower portal lactate values at points C and D as compared to LPS control
