300 μg selenium per day	placebo	serum selenium levels after intervention	8612	8830	the serum selenium levels after intervention increased in the selenium group (median increase 1.44 μmol/L, IQR 0.66; 1.92, p=0.004), but not in the placebo group (median increase 0.02 μmol/L, IQR -0.04; 0.18, p=0.314).
300 μg selenium per day	placebo	Baseline levels of toenail selenium 	8466	8568	Baseline levels of serum (p=0.562) or toenail (p=0.449) selenium did not differ between the two groups
300 μg selenium per day	placebo	effect of selenium on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)	1247	1329	an inhibitory effect of selenium on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
300 μg selenium per day	placebo	Baseline levels of serum selenium 	8466	8568	Baseline levels of serum (p=0.562) or toenail (p=0.449) selenium did not differ between the two groups
300 μg selenium per day	placebo	expression of genes involved in wound healing and inflammation	1341	1447	selenium was associated with down-regulated expression of genes involved in wound healing and inflammation
300 μg selenium per day	placebo	expression of genes involved in wound healing and inflammation	11199	11563	expression of genes involved in cellular adhesion, inflammation, extracellular matrix interactions and chemokine signaling was down-regulated after intervention with selenium. For the placebo group, gene sets referring to inflammation, infection, hemostasis and cellular adhesion were enriched and considered 'positive' after the intervention (data not presented),
