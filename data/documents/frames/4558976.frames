tiapride	placebo	extinction learning in a novel context (ABA condition)	822	1010	The tiapride-treated group (TIA) showed significantly impaired ABA extinction learning and a significant within-group difference between ABA and AAA extinction, compared to placebo (PLAC).
tiapride	placebo	AAA extinction learning	23772	24162	When considering only extinction learning in a novel context (ABA condition), the TIA group was significantly impaired compared to PLAC [t(38) = 1.989 p = 0.027; TIA 24.00% ± 3.81; PLAC 15.00% ± 2.43], while there was no significant difference in AAA extinction learning between groups [t(38) = 0.673 p = 0.252; TIA 18.25% ± 2.93; PLAC 16.00% ± 1.59—all t-tests one-tailed]. (See Figure 2A)

tiapride (TIA)	placebo	activation during ABA and AAA extinction in bilateral dlPFC (BA 9) and OFC (BA 10), fusiform gyrus and temporal pole, right hippocampus and left lingual gyrus	32246	32732	A two-sample t-test showed reduced activation of the TIA group compared to PLAC during ABA and AAA extinction in bilateral dlPFC (BA 9) and OFC (BA 10), fusiform gyrus and temporal pole, as well as in right hippocampus and left lingual gyrus. Moreover, there was reduced activation in right lingual gyrus exclusively in ABA extinction, as well as reduced activation in left vmPFC (BA 10) and hippocampus, and in bilateral insula exclusively in AAA extinction (see Table 3 and Figure 4).
