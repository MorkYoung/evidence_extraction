6-week home-based exercise program	usual care	6-minute walk test, change in chair-to-standing repetitions	14256	14492	No significant difference between groups was observed for changes in the 6-minute walk test (p = 0.754), but there was a trend toward a change in chair-to-standing repetitions (exercise group, 0.2 vs. usual care group, -2.2; p = 0.137).
6-week home-based exercise program	usual care	moderate physical activity	1004	1312	A total of 57 participants (79.2%) completed the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that moderate physical activity level increased significantly by 269.4 ± 260.6 minutes per week in the exercise group (mean between-group difference, 254.6 minutes; 95% confidence interval, 172.7–434.7; p < 0.001).
