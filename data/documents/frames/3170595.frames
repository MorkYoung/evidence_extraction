Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Rate of adverse events	24645	24701	Adverse events recorded amongst both groups were similar
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Myasthenia gravis score improvement	1265	1421	There was no difference between the AZA- and MTX-groups in respect of prednisone dosing (apart from months 10 and 12), in quantitative MG Score improvement,
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Mean prednisone requirement at months 10 and 12	1527	1626	The MTX-group received lower prednisone doses between month 10 (p = 0.047) and month 12 (p = 0.039)
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Mean prednisone requirement (except for months 10 and 12)	1266	1526	here was no difference between the AZA- and MTX-groups in respect of prednisone dosing (apart from months 10 and 12), in quantitative MG Score improvement, proportions in sustained remission, frequencies of MG relapses, or adverse reactions and/or withdrawals.
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Rate of adverse events	24645	24830	Adverse events recorded amongst both groups were similar apart from a preponderance of gastrointestinal events amongst the MTX-group and more anxiety and moodiness amongst the AZA-group
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Myasthenia gravis score improvement	1265	1419	There was no difference between the AZA- and MTX-groups in respect of prednisone dosing (apart from months 10 and 12), in quantitative MG Score improvemen
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Mean prednisone requirement (except for months 10 and 12)	21164	21322	Prednisone doses were not significantly different between the AZA and MTX groups throughout the study except at months 10 (p = 0.047) and month 12 (p = 0.039)
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Myasthenia gravis relapses	1265	1484	There was no difference between the AZA- and MTX-groups in respect of prednisone dosing (apart from months 10 and 12), in quantitative MG Score improvement, proportions in sustained remission, frequencies of MG relapses
Methotrexate	Azathioprine	Myasthenia gravis relapses	1265	1525	There was no difference between the AZA- and MTX-groups in respect of prednisone dosing (apart from months 10 and 12), in quantitative MG Score improvement, proportions in sustained remission, frequencies of MG relapses, or adverse reactions and/or withdrawals
