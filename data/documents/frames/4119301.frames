alginate impressions	silicone impressions	Likert scores	-1	-1	There was significant evidence from the patient reported Likert scores that silicone impressions were more comfortable than alginate impressions (p = 0.0021) but no evidence of a difference in taste between the two impression materials (p = 0.1128).
alginate impressions	silicone impressions	oral health related quality of life	-1	-1	After wearing the dentures for the two 8 week Adjustment Periods, there was significant evidence that the OHIP-EDENT score was lower (better oral health related quality of life) after wearing dentures made with silicone impressions materials with a median reduction in score of 5.5 units (p = 0.0014) (see Table 3).
alginate impressions	silicone impressions	preference rates	14331	14457	There was a 50% difference in preference rates (in favour of silicone) (95% CI 32.7–67.3%, p < 0.0001 McNemar's test) Table 1.

alginate impressions	silicone impressions	comfort, stability, chewing efficiency	14494	14938	After the 'Habituation Period' (i.e. before substantial denture adjustment), the patient reported assessment of the 'Comfort', 'Stability' and 'Chewing Efficiency' of the dentures showed significant evidence that unadjusted dentures made from silicone impressions were rated as more comfortable (p = 0.0039), more stable (p = 0.0047) and more efficient for chewing (p < 0.0001) than unadjusted dentures made from alginate impressions (Table 2).
