enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) 1440?mg/day for first 6?months	intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) 0.5–1?g/m2 monthly	The early discontinuation rates	17294	17498	Of note, the adjusted rate of discontinuation within 6 months was significantly higher in the CYC group (per cent difference 16.90, 95% CI 1.3 to 32.4, p=0.03; adjusted for baseline proteinuria and eGFR).
enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) 1440?mg/day for first 6?months	intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) 0.5–1?g/m2 monthly	The early discontinuation rates	1282	1439	The early discontinuation rates, mainly from serious infections, were significantly higher in CYC group (percentage differences of 16.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 32.4).
enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) 1440?mg/day for first 6?months	intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) 0.5–1?g/m2 monthly	complete and partial remission rates and times to remission	1440	1615	At the 12th month, both arms were comparable in terms of complete and partial remission rates (68% CYC and 71% EC-MPS) and times to remission (96 days CYC and 97 days EC-MPS).
enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) 1440?mg/day for first 6?months	intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) 0.5–1?g/m2 monthly	Death and serious infections	20901	21107	The percentage of serious fatal and non-fatal infections was, however, higher in the CYC group (15.63% vs 3.7%, the per cent difference adjusted for baseline proteinuria 13.35 (95% CI 0.3 to 26.4), p=0.04).
enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) 1440?mg/day for first 6?months	intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) 0.5–1?g/m2 monthly	Composites of unfavourable outcomes (death, doubling of serum creatinine, non-remission and intolerance to treatment)	1616	1802	Composites of unfavourable outcomes (death, doubling of serum creatinine, non-remission and intolerance to treatment) were 46.9% and 37% in CYC and EC-MPS (risk difference=9.84; p=0.44).
