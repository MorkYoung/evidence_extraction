L-lysine	Placebo	Capacity to solve problems	21054	21313	Problem solving capacity and cognitive flexibility, as assessed by the WCST, was significantly improved following treatment. This effect was statistically significant measured as decrease in the number of errors on the WCST (F(2,14) = 4.91, P < 0.05, Table 2)
L-lysine	Placebo	Symptom severity by PANSS measure	20425	20969	given a biologically significant effect of L-lysine, a major part of the improvement in the testing score should be attributed to the L-lysine treatment period, and less to the placebo period and this effect should be detected in the interaction analysis. Albeit close to a significant interaction (F(2,12) = 3.08, P = 0.08), this analysis did not reach statistical significance and consequently it could not be excluded that a significant part of the effects obtained on the PANSS score was caused by factors not related to L-lysine treatment.
L-lysine	Placebo	L-lysine blood concentration	16147	16421	Analysis of L-lysine concentration in blood showed a significant effect of treatment such that concentration increased after L-lysine treatment (6 g/day for four weeks) compared to baseline and placebo levels (F(2,14) = 7.84, P < 0.05, Table 2), in 8 out of the 10 patients.
L-lysine	Placebo	Capacity to solve problems	21054	21178	Problem solving capacity and cognitive flexibility, as assessed by the WCST, was significantly improved following treatment.
L-lysine	Placebo	Adverse side effects	16670	16777	the L-lysine treatment was not found to induce any adverse side effects including extrapyramidal effects. N
L-lysine	Placebo	L-lysine blood concentration	928	1035	L-lysine treatment caused a significant increase in blood concentration of L-lysine and was well tolerated.
L-lysine	Placebo	Adverse side effects	16658	16775	urthermore, the L-lysine treatment was not found to induce any adverse side effects including extrapyramidal effects.
