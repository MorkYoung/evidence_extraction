2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Bleeding tendency	20491	20647	The mean ± SD bleeding tendency was 2.0 ± 0.1 in the L80 group and 2.2 ± 0.1 in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .206)
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Overall satisfaction score of the participants and operators	20659	21038	The mean ± SD overall satisfaction score of the operators was 3.9 ± 0.9 in the L80 group and 3.8 ± 1.0 in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .548) (Table 3). The mean ± SD overall satisfaction score of the participants was 3.6 ± 0.1 in the L80 group and 3.7 ± 0.1 in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .693)
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Time of onset of anesthesia	19704	19872	The mean ± SD time of onset was 4.9 ± 4.1 minutes in the L80 group and 5.2 ± 4.1 minutes in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .447)
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Self-reported pain intensity	19241	19503	Although the participants in the L200 group reported having experienced more intense pain than those in the L80 group (P = .055), the upper limit of the 1-sided confidence interval was 12.9 mm, which is lower than the noninferiority tolerance of 15 mm (Table 2).
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Overall satisfaction score of the participants and operators	20659	21051	The mean ± SD overall satisfaction score of the operators was 3.9 ± 0.9 in the L80 group and 3.8 ± 1.0 in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .548) (Table 3). The mean ± SD overall satisfaction score of the participants was 3.6 ± 0.1 in the L80 group and 3.7 ± 0.1 in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .693) (Table 3). T
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Time of anesthesia action	19885	20075	he mean ± SD duration of action of anesthesia was 183.5 ± 5.0 minutes in the L80 group and 182.2 ± 5.4 minutes in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .758)
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Self-reported pain intensity	19241	19570	Although the participants in the L200 group reported having experienced more intense pain than those in the L80 group (P = .055), the upper limit of the 1-sided confidence interval was 12.9 mm, which is lower than the noninferiority tolerance of 15 mm (Table 2). Therefore, the pain control of L200 was noninferior to that of L80
2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine 	2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 	Time of onset of anesthesia	19572	19872	The secondary efficacy analysis was carried out to compare the time of onset of anesthesia for the 2 concentrations of epinephrine. The mean ± SD time of onset was 4.9 ± 4.1 minutes in the L80 group and 5.2 ± 4.1 minutes in the L200 group, with no significant difference between the groups (P = .447)
